Abstract This work investigates the effect of two wall roughness types, triangular and circular, on convection and radiation heat transfer in a small space. The ANSYS Fluent is used to do thermal and dynamic modeling; the left wall is warmer than the right one. The upper and lower walls are adiabatic. The Nusselt numbers are compared in all cases and for two Rayleigh values, which change based on the cavity's characteristic length. The results show temperature contours and Nusselt curves. It was observed that the roughness had a strong effect on the air's thermal behavior inside the cavity, where the Nusselt decreased in both roughness cases, especially at small heights. However, the largest decrease is in the triangular case and for angles less than 90\u00b0. For 72\u00b0, Nusselt is 13.32 and 6% less than smooth and circular cases respectively.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391821688"}}

Air cavity deformation by single jointed diver model entry bodies Competitive divers are able to attain much higher scores when they perform a splash-less entry. To achieve this goal, they use the \u201crip\u201d entry maneuver where they roll their body forward immediately after impact. This dynamic shape change after impact separates them from previously studied entry bodies. An experimental study of a geometrically simplified hinged diver model is presented. The results for five different hinged models are reported. Geometric and hinge stiffness changes are used to identify the most important aspects of the maneuver. The trajectory of these models after impact and the estimated size of the entrained air cavity are reported. The models that deform the fastest also have the largest final estimated air cavity. A non-dimensional time based on the time to complete deformation is found to collapse the estimated size of the air cavity for all models that deform before the trailing air cavity collapses. Fixed models are introduced to compare the hinged models to non-deforming entry bodies. The hinged models are found to have between 42% and 154% larger estimated air cavities during the final measurement than their fixed counterpart. At the moment of deep seal, two distinct air cavities are formed: one that connects to the atmosphere above the pool that has smooth walls and a lower cavity largely composed of small bubbles. This composition is analogous to observations of competitive divers. Entry bodies that deform are found to significantly change the shape and formation of the air cavity. An experimental apparatus for generating homogeneous isotropic turbulence An experimental apparatus using synthetic jets to generate zero mean flow homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) in the center of a cubic water tank is presented. Pumps drive jets at the corners and midpoints of the tank edges, producing center- facing flow to generate turbulence. The array of synthetic jets is controlled by a random forcing algorithm (Variano et al. in Exp Fluids 37:613\u2013615, 2004) to optimize generation of turbulence while minimizing mean and secondary flows. We explore different combinations of mean percentage of jets on, \ud835\udef7on, mean on-time, Ton, and pump outlet velocity, VP, to determine their respective roles in turbulence generation. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) are used to measure the velocity in the central isotropic region of the tank to determine turbulence statistics including mean velocities, mean flow strength, turbulent kinetic energy, spectra, integral scales, dissipation rates, Kolmogorov scales, Taylor microscales, and the Taylor-scale Reynolds number. We identified a range of input parameters to vary energy and length scales of the flow while maintaining homogeneity and isotropy in the central core of the facility. Magnitudes of the Taylor- scale Reynolds number ranged from 68 to 176 in the apparatus. Negligible mean recirculations were found, with mean flow strength values ranging from 1.26 to 2.99%, while ratios of root mean square turbulent velocities remained between 0.93 and 0.98, indicating a high degree of isotropy.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4390696542"}}

The impact of high-velocity projectiles on fluid-filled containers can induce the hydrodynamic ram (HRAM) effect, leading to the creation of a cavity within the fluid. The evolution of this cavity is subject to the constraints imposed by the container. This study aims to investigate the decay of projectile velocity and the development of confined HRAM cavities using a combined approach involving experimental and analytical methods. In contrast to existing research, this study accounts for the varying projectile velocities during different HRAM phases. Furthermore, enhancements have been introduced to the established cavity model, encompassing refinements in pressure differentials both inside and outside the cavity, alongside adjustments to the radial extent of liquid disturbance. The effectiveness of these refinements has been substantiated through experimental evidence. The findings illuminate two prominent constraint effects exerted by the container on the dynamics of HRAM cavities. Primarily, it accentuates the disparity in HRAM cavity pressures between the interior and exterior environments, and this pressure differential follows an exponential decay with distance. Secondly, it profoundly influences the flow of liquid near the wall, resulting in a considerably slower contraction of the cavity near the wall compared to its expansion phase. The evolution of the HRAM cavity is observed to manifest across three distinct stages: the unconfined cavity expansion stage, the partial cavity confinement stage, and the full cavity confinement stage.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4388789683"}}

Flow and aerothermal characteristics of rarefied hypersonic flows passing through slender cavities are investigated comprehensively using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method by various cases, such as the cavity with different depth-to-width ratios and different inclination angles, and the freestream at different altitudes and Mach numbers. The cavity depth-to-width ratio has a great influence on flow structures and gas density inside the cavity, but a slight effect on gas temperature inside the cavity and on heat flux over cavity surfaces. In comparison to the vertical cavity, the upstream-inclined cavity reduces the gas density and the high-temperature area inside the cavity, showing a decrease rate of gas density of about 53% for \u03c6 = -45\u00b0, while the downstream-inclined cavity greatly raises the gas density and slightly expands the high-temperature area, reaching a growth rate of gas density of about 114% for \u03c6 = 45\u00b0. As the freestream altitude increases from 50 to 80 km, the main vortex expands remarkably while the heat flux near the top of the aft wall decreases sharply, and a noteworthy finding is that the dimensionless temperature contours inside the cavity for the cases of H = 50, 60, and even 70 km seem to be unchanged. Compared with the case of Ma = 6, the maximum density inside the cavity is increased by about 5.5 times for the case of Ma = 30, and it is about 7.3 times for the maximum temperature inside the cavity. However, raising the freestream Mach number seems to not alter the streamline patterns inside the cavity. The three-dimensional effect reduces the maximum density inside the cavity by about 14.5% to 17.4% and results in a smaller main vortex compared with the two-dimensional (2D) cavity, and moreover, the slender cavity can weaken the three-dimensional effect due to its larger depth-to-width ratio and the relatively short cavity width.

During core meltdown in a nuclear reactor the corium may propagates toward the lower head and hit the vessel or structural elements as a coherent liquid jet. This could occur for instance in sodium fast reactors (SFR) if discharge tubes and an in-vessel core-catcher are used as mitigation devices. This can result in the ablation of the core-catcher and potential loss of its integrity. During ablation, a cavity is formed within the solid. Therefore the ablation of a solid structure by a liquid jet is studied here, with a focus on the cavity shape to improve future core-catcher designs. During the cavity formation, liquid flows over the cavity being formed as a liquid film in the film ablation regime, and ultimately results in the formation of a liquid pool. In the film ablation regime, two types of cavity shapes have been identified previously. To describe the process of the cavity formation, a mathematical model valid in this film ablation regime is here proposed which links the local melting rate to the local curvature of the cavity. It is applied with two sets of assumptions applicable to the two types of cavity previously identified. For the first assumption set, the heat transfer coefficient varies along the liquid/solid interface while the liquid temperature is held constant, it is representative of laminar boundary layer growth in laminar film. For the second assumption set, the heat transfer coefficient is held constant while the temperature varies along the liquid/solid interface, this is consistent with a turbulent liquid film.

The experimental repeatability is verified. The influence of the ice-hole constraint on the evolution process of the cavity of the cylinder is investigated by dividing in three stages: the cavity expansion stage, the surface closure stage, and the deep closure stage. Besides, the evolution characteristics of the cavity under four different experimental conditions are studied. Results show that during the cavity expansion stage, the cavity expansion is constrained by the ice-hole. The left side of the cavity near the free surface is curved. With the increase of the ice-hole diameter, the curvature of the left side profile of the cavity gradually decreases. The liquid around the water-entry point impacts the inner wall of the ice-hole to generate a reflective flow. During the surface closure stage, the impact of the reflective flow inhibits the contraction of the right side of the cavity wall, which further induces that the surface closure of the cavity is delayed. Besides, under the influence of smaller ice-hole, the right tail of the cavity wall is impacted by the reflective flow and a local impact collapse occurs. As the diameter of the ice-hole increases, the right tail of the cavity wall is folded but does not collapse significantly, and independent surface closure jet and reflective flow can be observed. During the deep closure stage, under the ice-hole constraint, in addition to the puff-off collapse, it can be found that the shedding collapse is accompanied by the local impact collapse.

The hybrid nanofluid containing Cu-Al2O3 nanoparticles was used. The impact of changes in the values of dimensionless parameters, such as the Rayleigh number, heated wall length, oscillation frequency, oscillation amplitude, and oscillation period, on the flow and heat transfer within the cavity was examined. Results showed that an increase in the length of the hot source resulted in a decrease in heat transfer rate and that increasing the Rayleigh number led to a significant increase in total entropy generation and heat transfer irreversibility. A drop in the average Bejan number was noted as the Rayleigh number increased, demonstrating the prevalence of entropy caused by fluid friction. The effect of changing the amplitude had a higher impact on the average Nusselt number compared to the frequency value.

The rolling of the launch platform can alter the development of the tail cavity, significantly altering the influence of the impact load on the motion and attitude of the vehicle. The present study employs the shear stress transport k-w model, the volume of fluid multiphase flow model, the Schnerr\u2013Sauer cavity model, and the overlapping mesh technique to conduct numerical simulations of the underwater launching process of a ventilated vehicle under both stationary and rolling boundaries. A comparative analysis is conducted to examine the evolution of the cavity shape, pressure distribution, and collapse-induced load in the tail cavity under various conditions after vehicle launch. The findings suggest that the rolling of the tube induces an asymmetrical development of the shoulder cavity lengths and widths on both the windward and leeward sides, with the result of a lower peak pressure at the cavity closure position compared with that under stationary conditions. The rolling of the tube reduces the internal velocity within the tail cavity, elevates the rupture position of the tail cavity, delays the tail cavity rupture, impacts the timing of the force peak occurrence in the vertical direction of the vehicle, reduces the high pressure at the point of tail cavity rupture, and modifies the post-rupture structural characteristics of the tail cavity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4388723819"}}

A comprehensive numerical analysis is conducted to investigate rarefied hypersonic flows over two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) non-rectangular cavities with inclined front or rear walls using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The objective is to give a contribution to the understanding of the effects of inclined front or rear walls on flow features and aerodynamic surface quantities. The 3-D or finite-span effects are also analysed in depth. Results show that inclining the front wall of the cavity has a negligible effect on gas flows in the rear part of the cavity, and consequently does not affect surface pressures on and heat fluxes to both the cavity floor and the rear wall. This is because high-speed gases enter the cavity via the top of the rear wall, which is exactly the dominant drive force for gas flows in the rear portion of the cavity. Inclining the front wall does not alter this drive force, so it does not influence gas flows there. However, inclining the rear wall not only strongly influences the flows close to the rear wall, but also has a profound influence on the flows in the front portion of the cavity. Specifically, it can substantially enhance the flow expansion in the front portion of the cavity, make the front vortex shorter and moves the front vortex upward and leftward. The 3-D or finite-span effects play an important role in the flow features and surface quantities of rectangular, inclined-front, and inclined-rear cavities. The finite-span effects exhibit as the 3-D relieving effects, which prevent the external stream from penetrating deeper into the cavity. This consequently lessens the momentum and energy that are transferred into the cavity and brings about a significant decrease in the pressure on and heat flux to the cavity floor.

The physical parameters related to the mass transport are identified by comparing with the experimental measurements. By using the validated parameters, we find that the thermal radiation and the condensation process cannot be ignored, and the number of water molecule increases at the first collapse point. In addition, the maximum cavity size increases with increasing absorption of thermal radiation, but decreases when the condensation coefficient increases. Increasing the discharge energy and ambient temperature are found to help generate larger cavity. The inner temperature and pressure at the collapse phase increases with the increase of the discharge energy, whereas decreases when the ambient temperature increases. Furthermore, the minimum temperature at the first maximum size is up to 3000 K under 0.1 MPa, and reaches 8000 K when the ambient pressure is larger than 1 MPa.

So, it can be treated as a remedy to decrease surface heat transfer coefficient. No significant impact is seen on the wall pressure coefficient and friction coefficient due to injection. The average number flux is increased due to injection. Higher L/D ratios result in a higher average heat transfer coefficient while having lower gradients along the wall. Enhancing the injection velocity would decrease the heat transfer coefficient and promotes cooling effects. Cold-to-hot heat transfer occurs inside the cavity and heat flux lines show that injection, decreases the flow temperature inside the cavity near the rear wall in comparison with no injection case.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4382930289"}}

The purpose of this investigation is to report the thermal performance of water-based nanofluids with two different types of hybrid nanofluids for the cooling process of the radiator inside the thermally heated square cavity under the addition of thermal radiation and magnetic field by using the finite element method. The heat transfer analysis of MHD nanofluid with the suspension of titanium alloy Ti6A14V and aluminum alloy AA7075 in cavity flow problems under the effects of thermal radiation and thermal boundary conditions by using the Galerkin finite element method is not reported before. In this numerical investigation, the novel mathematical model of two types of titanium alloy Ti6A14V (class of titanium) and aluminum alloy AA7075 is proposed first time in the cavity flows under the influence of a uniform magnetic field and non-uniform thermally heated bottom wall. The momentum and energy equations are updated with terms of magnetic field and thermal radiation, respectively. The cavity is filled with AA7075- Ti6A14V/water nanofluids. Two parallel vertical walls of the cavity are set at constant temperatures (Tc) and the top one is adiabatic while the temperature at the lower wall is taken as the variable. The physical model is composed in terms of nonlinear differential equations and transformed into a dimensionless form by using suitable non-dimensional quantities. The Galerkin finite element method along with iterative Newton\u2019s Raphson method is selected to simulate the problem and obtain the numerical solution with a high degree of accuracy.

The construction process of a cast-in-situ bored pile is too complicated to be described by the cavity expansion theory with a single process. An exact unified semi-analytical solution for both cylindrical and spherical cavities reverse expansion after unloading in drained soil is developed. The non-associated Mohr-Coulomb model and definition of logarithmic strain are adopted in the reverse plastic zone. This model can be used to solve the stress and displacement fields of the soil around a bored pile along both the horizontal and depth directions. Parametric analysis shows that the effect of the unloading phase does not change the ultimate pressure of cavity reverse expansion compared with in situ expansion. The cavity cannot re-expand to its initial radius even though the cavity pressure reloads to the initial value. The increase of internal friction angle, cohesion, and Young's modulus has a positive effect on radius recovery, while the dilatancy angle has a negative effect. A simulation of the construction process of cast-in-situ bored piles is presented, where the role of boring, mud wall protection, and concrete placement is defined. An example that describes the stress and displacement fields around a pile shows that the total radial displacement of soil around the pile is dominated by contraction displacement.

Cylindrical and spherical cavity expansions in soils are of interest, especially when interpreting cone penetration tests (CPTs) and pressuremeter tests (PMTs). Here the cavity expansion problem is solved semi-analytically, considering partial drainage of the soil, when the cavity wall velocity is constant. The solutions may assist with the interpretation of CPTs and PMTs when partially drained conditions prevail in the surrounding soils. The solution procedure involves writing the governing partial differential equations in dimensionless form. The modified Cam-clay constitutive model is adopted for the soil to demonstrate the solution procedure, due to its wide familiarity, although other models could be used by making simple modifications. The variables in the partial differential equations are functions of a dimensionless time, T, and a dimensionless radial coordinate, H. T depends on cavity radius, the time after expansion began and a coefficient of consolidation. The equations are solved for when T is fixed, simultaneously as an initial value problem, as the partial differential equations become ordinary differential equations. Important features captured by the analyses include pore water pressure variations with soil volume changes, as well as the differential of the pore water pressure satisfying the no-flow cavity wall boundary condition. Results for a cavity expansion reveal that initially, when T and the cavity are small, drained conditions prevail. As T and the cavity become larger the soil becomes partially drained and eventually undrained. T is analogous to the dimensionless cone penetration velocity used in CPT studies. Normalised cavity wall pressures vary with T similar to that of normalised cone penetration resistances, demonstrated using experimental data. Plots of the normalised cavity wall pressures against the state parameter show that the two key fitting constants are heavily influenced by partial drainage. A similar dependence must exist when plotting a normalised cone penetration resistance against the state parameter when partially drained conditions prevail. The practical ramifications of not dealing with this partial drainage may be huge, especially when assessing liquefaction susceptibility through estimations of the state parameter using correlations developed for when drained conditions prevail. Significant underestimations of state parameter, liquefaction susceptibility and post-liquefaction strengths may result.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4327940559"}}

In this work, slope effect is obtained by the cavity upstream wall sloping upward and downward as well as bulging partially. Besides, cases of freestream with different velocities and altitudes are taken into account to examine the slope effect. It is found that cavity flow is transformed from the open type to the transitional and finally to the closed as the cavity upstream wall gradually slopes upward, promoting the heat energy exchange between gas molecules with the cavity floor, and meanwhile achieving a considerable rate of decrease of the peak heat flux on the reattachment corner. However, the upstream wall sloping downward or bulging partially seems to only have a slight effect on cavity flow and wall heat flux. It's worth noting that slope effect is closely related to velocity and altitude of the freestream, such as the greater the velocity and altitude, the stronger the slope effect. For the three-dimensional cavity configuration, influence of the upstream wall slope on cavity flow and wall heat flux is weaken considerably due to the three-dimensional effect. From the perspective of optimal design for the hypersonic thermal protection system, the cavity with an upward upstream wall is proposed because it not only reduces peak heat flux on the reattachment corner, but also decreases gas temperature inside the cavity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4322505834"}}

The unsteady water-entry cavitating flow characteristics of the shell are analyzed, and the evolution of cavities and jet impacts with different structures is studied. The results show that a nested multi-cavity is generated due to the self-jet phenomenon during water entry. The jet causes the diameter of the secondary cavity to be much larger than that of the primary cavity, and the morphology of the secondary cavity is more atomized. Due to the irregular motion of the jet, the primary cavity undergoes neck-shrinking phenomenon and is compressed, and the neck-shrinking position moves up as the secondary cavity grows. After secondary impact, a small jet appears at the bottom of the shell, which ejects out from the shell and increases the size of the bottom cavity, leading to the formation of quaternary cavity. Moreover, as the inner wall length increases, the time of the primary jet is advanced, while the depth of secondary cavity shortens. With the increase in the thickness, cavity shape becomes more similar to traditional supercavity, and the maximum diameter of the primary cavity increases.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4376276321"}}

The results for five different hinged models are reported. Geometric and hinge stiffness changes are used to identify the most important aspects of the maneuver. The trajectory of these models after impact and the estimated size of the entrained air cavity are reported. The models that deform the fastest also have the largest final estimated air cavity. A non-dimensional time scaled by the time to complete deformation is found to collapse the estimated size of the air cavity for all models that deform before pinch off. Fixed models are introduced to compare the hinged models to non-deforming entry bodies. The hinged models are found to have between 42% - 154% larger estimated air cavities during the final measurement than their fixed counterpart.

During core meltdown in a nuclear reactor the corium may propagates toward the lower head and hit the vessel or structural elements as a coherent liquid jet. This could occur for instance in sodium fast reactors (SFR) if discharge tubes and an in-vessel core-catcher are used as mitigation devices. This can result in the ablation of the core-catcher and potential loss of its integrity. During ablation, a cavity is formed within the solid. Therefore the ablation of a solid structure by a liquid jet is studied here, with a focus on the cavity shape to improve future core-catcher designs. During the cavity formation, liquid flows over the cavity being formed as a liquid film in the film ablation regime, and ultimately results in the formation of a liquid pool. In the film ablation regime, two types of cavity shapes have been identified previously. To describe the process of the cavity formation, a mathematical model valid in this film ablation regime is here proposed which links the local melting rate to the local curvature of the cavity. It is applied with two sets of assumptions applicable to the two types of cavity previously identified. For the first assumption set, the heat transfer coefficient varies along the liquid/solid interface while the liquid temperature is held constant, it is representative of laminar boundary layer growth in laminar film. For the second assumption set, the heat transfer coefficient is held constant while the temperature varies along the liquid/solid interface, this is consistent with a turbulent liquid film. The two modeling approaches are compared with experimental data acquired from the HAnSoLO experimental setup. Numerical predictions show promising agreements with experimental observations, particularly for the laminar boundary layer growth zone of the cavity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4384914367"}}

Two recent studies using such methods examined the organization and dynamics of two DNA molecules in box-like cavities with strong confinement in one direction and with square and elliptical cross sections in the lateral plane. Motivated by these experiments, we employ Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations to study the physical behaviour of two polymers confined to small cavities with shapes comparable to those used in the experiments. We quantify the effects of varying the following polymer properties and confinement dimensions on the organization and dynamics of the polymers: the polymer width, the polymer contour length ratio, the cavity cross-sectional area, and the degree of cavity elongation for cavities with rectangular and elliptical cross sections. We find that the tendency for polymers to segregate is enhanced by increasing polymer width. For sufficiently small cavities, increasing cavity elongation promotes segregation and localization of identical polymers to opposite sides of the cavity along its long axis. A free-energy barrier controls the rate of polymers swapping positions, and the observed dynamics are roughly in accord with predictions of a simple theoretical model. Increasing the contour length difference between polymers significantly affects their organization in the cavity.

The conventional high-speed images of cavitation with a set of X-ray phase contrast images reveal the presence of three different types of mechanisms responsible for large cloud shedding: re-entrant jet mechanism, condensation shock wave mechanism, and collapse-induced pressure wave mechanism. At higher cavitation numbers, the sheet cavity is relatively short and the cavity detachment is a consequence of a re-entrant jet pinching off the cavity from its leading edge. At lower cavitation numbers, the re-entrant jet plays a smaller role in the cavitation instabilities and the primary reason for periodic cloud shedding is the condensation shock mechanism where a void fraction discontinuity propagates upstream until collapsing the entire cavity. If the amount of shed vapour cloud reaches a certain extent, the collapse will emit a pressure wave strong enough to disturb the growing cavity, and subsequently make it detached from the wall. This is the third mechanism observed in the experiments. We point out the inappropriate classification of combining condensation shock and collapse-induced pressure wave mechanisms in the literature, since we identify pronounced differences between them: (i) the pressure increase across the condensation front is very weak (a few kPa) while the amplitude of collapse-induced pressure wave can be hundreds of kPa, (ii) the travelling velocity of the collapse-induced pressure wave within the cavity is much faster than the condensation shock, and (iii) the collapse-induced pressure wave does not result in an obvious discontinuity in void fraction when it propagates through the cavity, in contrary to the condensation shock.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4293795411"}}

Then, the effect of different initial ventilation flows (Q) and Froude numbers (Fr) on cavity collapse after the air supply was stopped was studied. Three different tail cavity closure types are observed: the intact cavity (IC), partially broken cavity (PBC), and pulsating foam cavity (PFC). The IC changes from a twin vortex tube closure to a reentrant jet closure, eventually collapsing entirely. The cavity collapse time decreases with increasing Fr and increases with increasing Q. The dimensionless cavity length (L/D) has an exponential relationship with time when Fr is small and becomes linear with time when Fr is large. The cavity collapse velocity increases with increasing Fr, while Q has little effect. For PBC collapses, the cavity first transforms into an IC and then collapses as an IC. L/D first increases to a local maximum and then decreases. The effect of the reflux gas on the cavity length is critical.

These fluctuations are mitigated by placing the microphones at the bottom of cavities, usually covered with a thin, acoustically transparent material. Prior experiments showed that the cavity geometry affects the propagation of TBL pressure fluctuations toward the bottom. However, the relationship between the cavity geometry and the flowfield within the cavity is not well understood. Therefore, a very large-eddy simulation was performed using the lattice Boltzmann method. A cylindrical, a countersunk and a conical cavity are simulated with and without a fine wire-cloth cover, which is modeled as a porous medium governed by Darcy's law. Adding a countersink to an uncovered cylindrical cavity is found to mitigate the transport of turbulent structures across the bottom by shifting the recirculation pattern away from the cavity bottom. Covering the cavities nearly eliminates this source of hydrodynamic pressure fluctuations. The eddies within the boundary layer, which convect over the cover, generate a primarily acoustic pressure field inside the cavities and thus suggesting that the pressure fluctuations within covered cavities can be modeled acoustically. As the cavity diameter increases compared to the eddies' integral length scale, the amount of energy in the cut-off modes increases with respect to the cut-on modes.

The design of parts of machines, mechanisms, structures and foundations, particularly in the aerospace industry, is closely related to the definition of the stress state of the body. The accuracy of determining the stress state is the key to optimizing the use of materials. Therefore, it is important to develop methods to achieve such goals. In this work, the second main spatial problem of the elasticity theory is solved for a layer with a longitudinal cylindrical cavity with periodic displacements given on the surface of the layer. The solution of the problem is based on the generalized Fourier method for a layer with a cylindrical cavity. To take into account periodic displacements, an additional problem is applied with the expansion of the solution for a layer (without a cavity) in the Fourier series. The general solution is the sum of these two solutions. The problem is reduced to an infinite system of linear algebraic equations, which is solved by the reduction method. As a result, the stress-strain state of the layer on the surface of the cavity and isthmuses from the cavity to the boundaries of the layer was obtained. The conducted numerical analysis has a high accuracy for fulfilling the boundary conditions and makes it possible to assert the physical regularity of the stress distribution, which indicates the reliability of the obtained results.

Abstract Flush-mounted cavity hot-wire probes have emerged as an alternative to classical hot-wire probes mounted several diameters above the surface for wall-shear stress measurements. They aim at increasing the frequency response and accuracy by circumventing the well-known issue of heat transfer to the substrate that hot-wire and hot-film probes possess. Their use, however, depends on the assumption that the cavity does not influence the flow field. In this study, we show that this assumption does not hold, and that turbulence statistics are modified by the presence of the cavity with sizes that are practically in use. The mean velocity and fluctuations increase near the cavity while the shear stress decreases in its surroundings, all seemingly stemming from the fact that the no-slip condition is not present anymore and that flow reversal occurs. Overall, the energy spectra and the probability density function of the wall shear stress fluctuations indicate a change of nature of turbulence by the presence of the cavity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4295773290"}}

The working fluid is air, the vertical aspect ratio (cavity height over width) is equal to 4, and the Rayleigh Number is equal to 108. The impact of the rear and front boundary conditions on the flow topology is highlighted. When the cavity depth increases, three-dimensional effects are encountered that enhance local heat transfer at the isothermal walls. In particular, for horizontal aspect ratio (cavity depth over width) greater than 1, an alternation of local maximum and minimum Nusselt numbers can be observed along the y-direction toward the center of the wall in the lower half part of the isothermal wall, which are similar to a wave-like behavior. It is shown that they are due to vortex structures generated by a G\u00f6rtler instability.

A comprehensive numerical study is performed to investigate rarefied hypersonic flows past various non-rectangular cavity configurations using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method with the effects of free-stream Mach numbers, high-temperature gas effects, and three-dimensional (3D) effects analyzed in depth. In this work, two groups of non-rectangular cavities are considered: one is the shallow-front type and the other is the shallow-rear type. The primary objective is to obtain insight into the flow characteristics and surface pressure on and heat flux to these non-rectangular cavities. Making the front or rear of the cavity shallower does not alter the flow characteristics inside the upper cavity too much, but it causes the vortex to not fill the entire cavity any longer. Instead, a \u201cdead-water\u201d region is formed in the bottom cavity, and this \u201cdead-water\u201d region becomes expanded as the front or rear of the cavity gets shallower. In addition, making the front or rear of the cavity shallower has little influence on surface pressure on and heat flux to the aft wall of the cavity, while it plays an important role in the distributions of surface pressure and heat transfer coefficients over the cavity floor. For the case of shallower-rear cavity, the surface pressure and heat flux at the right end of the cavity floor are as high as 2 and 20 times the rectangular-cavity value, respectively. Free-stream Mach number and high-temperature gas effects have a negligibly minor influence on flow characteristics inside the cavity, while 3D effects play an important role.

Some strategies used include the addition of flexible or hard partitions to the cavities (to split them into various pieces), thickening the borders, providing fins to the cavities, or altering the forms or cavity angles. Each of these methods may be used to increase or decrease heat transmission. Many computational and experimental investigations of heat transport in various cavity shapes have been conducted. The majority of studies focused on improving the thermal efficiency of heat transmission in various cavity containers. This paper introduced a review of experimental, numerical, and analytical studies related to heat transfer analyses in different geometries, such as circular, cylindrical, hexagonal, and rectangular cavities. Results of the evaluated studies indicate that the fin design increased heat transmission and sped up the melting time of the PCM; the optimal wind incidence angle for the maximum loss of combined convective heat depends on the tilt angle of the cavity and wind speed. The Nusselt number graphs behave differently when decreasing the Richardson number. Comparatively, the natural heat transfer process dominates at Ri = 10, but lid motion is absent at Ri = 1.

In this paper we study the impact of microfluidic jets generated by thermocavitation processes on a capillary bridge between two parallel planar walls. Different capillary bridge types were studied, Newtonian liquids, viscoelastic liquids and agarose gels. Thus, we compare the cavity formation and collapse between a wide range of material properties. Moreover, we model the critical impact velocity for a jet to traverse a capillary bridge type. Our results show that agarose gels with a storage modulus lower that 176 Pa can be modelled as a liquid for this transition. However, the predicted transition deviates for agarose gels with higher storage modulus. Additionally, we show different types of cavity collapse, depending on the Weber number and the capillary bridge properties. We conclude that the type of collapse determines the number and size of entrained bubbles. Furthermore, we study the effects of wettability on the adhesion forces and contact line dissipation. We conclude that upon cavity collapse, for hydrophobic walls a Worthington jet is energetically favourable. In contrast, for hydrophilic walls, the contact line dissipation is in the same order of magnitude of the energy of the impacted jet, suppressing the Worthington jet formation.

The cavity is convectively heated from the bottom; all four vertical walls of the cavity are isothermal and the top wall is adiabatic. A semitransparent window is created on the left wall of the cavity and a collimated beam is irradiated on this window at the polar and azimuthal angles of 900 and 1350, respectively. The numerical analysis has been performed for the transparent(\u03c4=0) and the participating (\u03c4=2.5 and 10) media within the cavity and keeping the value of other parameters, like Rayleigh number (Ra=105), Prandtl number (Pr=0.71), conduction-radiation parameter (N=1.5), irradiation (G=1000W/m2) fixed. The results reveal a quadrantal symmetry of fluid flow and heat transfer for various optical thicknesses and the cavity contains four conical vortices where each vortex is occupied in tetrahedron space in case of without collimated irradiation. Moreover, the Q-criterion reveals the formation of a mushroom like fluid-structure inside the cavity. However, with the inclusion of collimated irradiation, the quadrantal symmetry breaks and a bilaterally symmetric nature is established about the plane of the collimated beam. The flow structure becomes much more complex and has been explained by critical flow theory. In addition, the heat transfer characteristics also change in accordance with the dynamics of vortices inside the cavity. The Q-criterion reveals the formation of non-regular fluid structure which is same, however, orientation is opposite in the cavity for transparent and participating media.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4210523416"}}

The Navier-Stokes and energy equations modeling the propagation and reflection of acoustic waves generated by wall heating within closed cavities, also known as hydrodynamic model, can only adequately capture the predicted experimental trends when wall impedance is included in the model to take into account wave amplitude (resistance) and phase (reactance) losses upon wall reflection. These simulations are often restricted to one-dimension due to stiffness, since the extreme disparity between the smallest (acoustic) and largest (thermal diffusion) time scales lead to very large CPU times. Hence, thermodynamic models are often preferred instead, since they filter out the acoustic scales and model their effect, thus requiring much smaller CPU times. The present paper shows for the first time how soft wall resistance effects can be included in a thermodynamic model, leading to a significant improvement in their ability to predict experimental trends while still maintaining their low CPU times. This, in turn, led to the discovery that soft wall resistance turns the piston effect negligible even near the thermodynamic critical point. \u2022 Confined thermo-acoustic wave model modified to include soft wall resistance. \u2022 Acoustic waves suffer amplitude losses upon reflection off the now soft cavity walls. \u2022 Agreement with experimental data significantly improves with respect to hard wall model. \u2022 Piston effect is essentially eliminated by soft wall resistance.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4281978966"}}

This article discusses the problems of studying the issue of joint motion of liquids in the porous space. The article provides the construction of a mathematical model of the theory of ltration, which describes phase transitions. The main diculty in constructing this model is associated with the fact that free interphase boundaries create regions that change over time, and it is required to nd the temperature or concentration elds of substances in them. In this case, the coordinates of the considered phase boundaries are not initially specied and must be calculated already in the process of solving. For this, a derivation of the averaged equation for the problem of nding the rupture surface during the movement of two incompressible viscous liquids in the pores of the soil skeleton was proposed. The article deals with the case when the skeleton is an absolutely rigid body. The rationale was given for the choice of an averaged ltration model instead of a microscopic one. The main research methods are classical methods of mathematical physics, functional analysis and computation methods of the theory of partial dierential equations, as well as dierence methods.

To remove the limitation that the plane stress problem cannot be considered using cylindrical cavity expansion and to explore surface response of cylinder expansion in shallow soil, a semi-analytical undrained solution is developed for cylindrical cavity expansion in anisotropic modified Cam-clay model soils under the plane stress condition. The constitutive relationship is described by the K0-consolidated anisotropic modified Cam-clay (K0-AMCC) model, which can properly simulate the mechanical behaviour of the K0-consolidated natural clays. The problem is equivalent to solving ordinary differential equations to determine the effective stresses, vertical strain, and excess pore water pressure (EPWP). Parametric analyses are conducted to investigate the effective stresses, vertical strain, and EPWPs around the expanded cavity under plane stress condition. The results show a clear influence of over-consolidation ratio on the stresses, vertical strain, EPWP around the cavity, and effective stress paths for a soil particle at the cavity wall. Axial expansion or uplift of soil and negative pore water pressure are observed during cavity expansion under the plane stress condition. There are obvious differences in effective stress components around the cavity under two plane conditions.

Heat/mass transfer on the bottom surface of a rectangular cavity in an incompressible turbulent boundary layer flow is investigated, with emphasis on the effects of cavity width (W) to depth (d) ratio, for a cavity with aspect ratio L/d (length L to depth) of 6. For a wide cavity, this value of L/d is known to establish a flow structure in which the streamwise flow does not reattach on the bottom surface of the cavity, and instead shears past the entire open surface of the cavity, impinging on the downstream wall. A naphthalene sublimation mass transfer technique is used to evaluate local (mass) Stanton numbers at the cavity bottom surface for W/d ranging from 0.51 to 10, and two Reynolds numbers of 8100 and 12,800 defined using the cavity depth and freestream velocity. For W/d>2, the area-averaged mass transfer Stanton number asymptotes to a constant value. Despite the nominal two-dimensional behavior implied by the area-averaged Stanton number for W/d > 2, the details of the local mass transfer distributions show the effects of a system of multiple vortices that remain influential beyond W/d>2 and cause strong spatial variations in transport on the bottom surface. For W/d<2, the area-averaged Stanton number decreases as width is reduced, scaling as a power law with W/d, and appears to be independent of Reynolds number. Computations using the SST k\u2212\u03c9 RANS model are able to predict the measured heat/mass transfer at the bottom surface well for W/d>3. For 0.8<W/d<3, the computations are able to capture the trends only qualitatively.

In this paper, we conduct an experimental study on the cavity evolution behind a hydrophobic sphere entering the water. It is found that there is a correlation between splash and cavity evolution. Two dominant regimes for cavity pinch-off, including hydrostatic pressure and pressure pulsation inside cavity, are confirmed. When the splash is removed by a guard, the cavity pinch-off is dominated by hydrostatic pressure. The theoretical model is well consistent with the experimental results, including the cavity profile and the dimensionless pinch-off depth. However, when the splash domes, the theoretical solution fails with the increase in the effect of pressure pulsation inside the closed cavity. With the increase in the Froude number Fr, the splash closure most significantly impacts the necking position. The impact of the splash closure is dependent of Fr, and there is a critical value of Frcri separating the deep pinch-off into two regimes. The critical value of Frcri = 134 is theoretically proposed, which is a reasonable predication for the present experimental observations. In addition, the expansion rate of cavity volume is measured to confirm the transition of distinct regimes. Based on our theoretical analysis, the critical expansion rate is determined as 4.9, which agrees well with present experimental result 4.6. Distinct pinch-off regimes significantly impact the subsequent cavity evolution and the forces on sphere. A deep seal controlled by hydrostatic pressure is constantly accompanied by severe cavity resonance and a dramatic decrease in the cavity length, whereas pinch-off controlled by pressure pulsation leads to weak ripples.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4226145980"}}

Boundary layer separation, turbulence, unsteadiness, recirculation and reattachment complicate the flow phenomena at the cavity and may lead to substantial effects on heat transfer. Besides, in order to enhance the heat transfer in some applications, cavity flow was introduced, and thus the importance of understanding the cavity flow structure and its relation with heat transfer has become vital, where such a phenomenon occurs in many engineering applications.

When the gate valve is fully open, the particles are easy to collide with the cavity rear wall and enter into the cavity, resulting in particles\u2019 accumulation in the cavity. The particles in cavity will accumulate between the cavity bottom and the flashboard bottom wall and prevent the gate from turning off normally. Meanwhile, the particles\u2019 collision with cavity rear wall will cause serious erosion. Both the particles\u2019 accumulation and erosion will cause the poor sealing of the gate valve, further resulting in the leakage of the pipeline system. To reduce the particles\u2019 accumulation in cavity and erosion on cavity when the gate valve is fully open, we simplify the gate valve into a cavity structure and study it. We find that adding a slope upstream the cavity can effectively reduce the particles\u2019 accumulation in the cavity and the erosion on the cavity rear wall.

The influence of flow control on flow structures (e.g., shock wave and vortex) and aerothermal properties (e.g., temperature distribution and wall heat flux) is analyzed in detail. The flow structures and aerothermal properties of the cavity flowfield are both changed greatly by the square control block on the cavity opening line, such as a reduction of about 79.5% of the maximum of wall heat fluxes near the reattachment corner, while these changes are gradually weakened with the control block moving down. The control blocks with different shapes still have the ability to change flow structures and thus the heat flux coefficients over the cavity surfaces, but shape has little effect, and the square control block has the strongest wall heat flux compared with the circular, triangular, and wedged control blocks. For the supersonic jet with different directions, the leftward jet has the best performance in eliminating high temperature gas inside the cavity and over the downstream wall and reducing wall heat fluxes over cavity surfaces, followed by the downward jet. The main reason is that the leftward and downward jets can effectively prevent momentum and energy exchanges between freestream with cavity surfaces.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3216963990"}}

The most important of such degenerative changes is vitreous liquefaction or synchysis, in which pockets of liquid known as lacunae form in the vitreous gel. The movement mechanism and characteristics of vitreous liquefaction are quite complex. In this study, the flow dynamics of partial vitreous liquefaction (PVL) as two-phase viscoelastic-Newtonian fluid flow are investigated in the human eye. A reliable three-dimensional (3D) numerical procedure is developed for capturing the interface effects and dynamic characteristics of these two-phase complex fluid flows. In the present work, two different configurations of the PVL including liquefied pocket in the central and the posterior portions of the vitreous cavity are considered. The effects of lens indentation on the flow field and interface deformation of PVL inside the vitreous cavity are investigated. The results show that the curvature of the vitreous cavity due to the lens capsule increases shear and normal stresses in comparison with those for the PVL in a sphere as a simplified model. It is observed that the presence of lens indentation and the location of liquefied region are two factors that can produce conditions of asymmetry inside the vitreous body.

To solve the Stokes and Brinkman equations for the fluid velocity, a solution is constituted by the general solutions in two spherical coordinate systems originated from the particle and cavity centers and the boundary conditions are satisfied by a collocation technique. Numerical results of the hydrodynamic torque on the soft sphere are obtained as a function of the core-to-particle radius ratio, particle-to-cavity radius ratio, relative center-to-center distance of the particle and cavity, and ratio of the particle radius to the permeation length in the porous layer over the entire ranges. The effect of the cavity on the torque of a rotating soft particle is weaker than that of a corresponding hard particle (or soft one with lower permeability or thinner thickness of its porous layer). While the normalized torque of a soft sphere in general is an increasing function of the particle-to-cavity radius ratio, a weak minimum of it (surprisingly, less than the value of an unconfined particle) may occur for a particle with a small to mediate core-to-particle radius ratio and a high permeability inside a nonconcentric cavity at a moderate value of the particle-to-cavity radius ratio.

Instead, light and compact subsonic projectile probes can be considered as an alternative subsurface investigation tool in such exploratory missions to overcome a host of challenges. Such probes can be launched from a lunar orbiter or lander to the surface of the Moon to provide the initial effective penetration from the impact. Here, we develop a model based on the spherical cavity expansion theory to predict the deceleration rate and final penetration depth of a rigid projectile probe into geological targets under the perpendicular subsonic impact. Two stress fields are assumed to propagate in the medium, plastic (near field) and elastic (far field), upon the impact. The stresses at the cavity wall are obtained by combining the Mohr\u2013Coulomb failure criterion for the target failure (plastic region) considering two different assumptions for plastic wave propagation. Two field experiments are used to compare and assess the robustness of the proposed solutions in the subsonic range. Base on the simulation results and the experiments, it is concluded that the cavity expansion model considering the locked hydrostat assumption, with the modification here introduced for the volumetric strain, can provide us with a reasonable prediction of the projectile penetration, final penetration depth and the stresses on the probe.

The cavity boundary displacement is solved by the mass conservation equation of the plastic zone, and the theoretical calculation model of the static elliptical cavity expansion is established. The results indicated that when the material reaches stability under the load of elliptical cavity boundary, the axis stress value increases gradually from the minor axis to the major axis of the elliptical cavity, showing a similar sinusoidal distribution.

For high-speed underwater vehicles, cavitation can be one of the most important speed barriers. The cavitating flow can be even complex when an underwater vehicle is sailing close to the free surface/wall. In this study, the mutual effects of the free surface and near-wall on the cloud cavitating flow that surrounds an axisymmetric projectile are investigated by water tank experiment and the computational fluids dynamics (CFD). The Split-Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) technology is applied in the experiment to accelerate the projectile in a short time. In our numerical approach, the volume of fluid (VOF) method, the large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence model, and the Zwart-Gerber-Belamri (ZGB) cavitation model are used. The cloud cavitating flow under the free surface/wall effect is investigated by changing the distance between the projectile and free surface (df) or wall (dw). Both the experiment and the simulation show that the unstable cavity evolution includes four stages induced by the re-entrant jet: cavity growth, re-entrant jet, cavity shedding and collapsing. The results further show that as df decreases, the cavity length is shorter and the cavity becomes more stable; as dw decreases, the cavity length is longer and the cavity becomes less stable. By understanding the free surface/wall effect on the stability of the cloud cavitating flow, the parameters space spanned by df and dw can be divided into several distinct flow regimes, in which the entire shedding cavity (symmetry/asymmetry), steady and non-shedding cavity, partial cavity shedding, and ventilated cavity are identified.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3194093709"}}

Further, the radiation heat transfer may be diffuse (propagation of energy in all directions) or collimated (energy propagates in single direction). The qualitative and quantitative analysis of radiation heat transfer are required in order to understand its effects on the fluid flow and also on heat transfer. In the present work, the effects of diffuse and collimated radiation on the symmetrical cooling case of natural convection in a two-dimensional cavity heated from the bottom have been investigated, numerically. The cavity is convectively heated from the bottom, while both vertical walls of the cavity are isothermal. The top wall is adiabatic and all walls are opaque for radiation heat transfer. For the collimated case, a small semitransparent window has been created on the left wall and collimated irradiation of value 1000 W/m2 at an azimuthal angle 135\u00b0is applied on this semitransparent window. The study has been performed in two stages, first, the effect of diffuse radiation on the natural convection has been observed and then, in the second stage, a collimated beam is passed through the semitransparent window. The results reveal that the diffuse radiation has little effect on the dynamics of two rolls inside the cavity, however, collimated beam irradiation changes the dynamics of two rolls significantly and also the heat transfer characteristics. This further changes with the optical thickness of the fluid. The left vortex is bigger than the right vortex for collimated beam in transparent fluid, whereas, a reverse trend is seen for the collimated beam for the non-zero optical thickness of the fluid. The size of the left vortex increases with the increase of optical thickness of the fluid. The heat transfer reversal happens at the zone of a collimated beam incident on the bottom wall for transparent medium, whereas, this does not happen for participating medium.

In the current study, a steady jet is forced from a cavity leading edge at different momentum fluxes (0.11 kg/ms2, 0.44 kg/m\u00b7s2, and 0.96 kg/m\u00b7s2). The investigation was performed for an open cavity with length to depth ratio of 4 at the Reynolds number based on a cavity depth of approximately 50,000. Particle image velocimetry, surface oil flow visualisation, constant temperature anemometry, and pressure measurements were performed in this investigation. The aim of the jet blowing is to separate the cavity separated shear layer from the recirculation zone to reduce the cavity return flow, and hence stabilise the cavity separated shear layer. It was found that increasing the jet momentum flux causes an increase in the cavity return flow due to the increase in the thickness of the cavity separated shear layer. The study also found that the jet populates the separated shear layer with a large number of small-scale disturbances. These disturbances increase the broad band level of the pressure power spectra and Reynolds shear stress in the cavity separated shear layer.

Abstract Shallow tunnels free of or subjected to the surface effects excavated in an elastic rock mass are usually simplified as an elastic infinite or semi-infinite plane problem with cavities in mechanics, respectively. In this paper, the equivalent inclusion method (EIM), a classic solution due to Eshelby usually used for predicting the elastic field caused by inhomogeneities embedded in a heterogeneous material, is extended to predict the elastic field induced by an arbitrarily shaped cavity. Similar to that of the inhomogeneity problems, the implementation of the EIM for the cavity problem is conducted by treating a cavity whose elastic modulus is zero as an inclusion having identical material properties to the matrix but containing eigenstrains. Based on an elementary solution for the eigenstress arising from the eigenstrains representing the cavity of an arbitrary shape can be calculated with the help of numerical discretization and superposition of contributions from each discretized element. A circular or rectangular cavity can be reduced to a crack when the distance between their upper and lower surfaces approaches an infinitesimal but not a zero value, hence the elastic field caused by cracks can be also resolved with the proposed solution method. The results obtained with the proposed method and the finite element method (FEM) for both the cavity and the crack are in good agreements. Parametric analyses on the effects of depth, length of the crack and the interactions among multiple cavities and cracks on the elastic field demonstrates the EIM as a good potential application in some significant applications in fracture behaviors for the excavated material.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3198754775"}}

This transition from circular to elongated cavity appeared earlier in the tests with higher viscosity fluids, while higher injection rates produced wider openings as the larger volume of fluid was able to displace more particles.

The cavity orientation angles considered are 60\u00b0 and 30\u00b0. While moving from 60\u00b0 to 30\u00b0, the cavity is inclined toward its stable configuration, wherein convection reduces. Flow instabilities have been captured through the spectral analysis of the transient history of temperature distribution recorded in a completely non-intrusive manner using a Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer. By virtue of the fact that in such configurations, corners of the cavity are the most active regions with regard to the interaction of buoyancy-driven fluid with the cavity walls, and the flow behavior is centrosymmetric (diagonal symmetry), the flow field in the top two corners of the cavity has been mapped. The spatio-temporally resolved interferometric measurements identified two distinct frequencies for cavity inclination angle (\u03b8) of 60\u00b0. These two frequencies correspond to two different flow instabilities, namely, the Tollmien\u2013Schlichting (TS) and gravity wave-induced instabilities. As the cavity is further inclined toward 30\u00b0, the instability in the boundary layer, i.e., the TS instability, ceases to exist, and only the gravity wave-induced instability is observed. The dependence of flow instabilities on cavity orientation angle is explained on the basis of interferometry-based measurements made in the form of interferograms and the corresponding whole field maps of temperature contours.

It is assumed that the energy does not leave by the conduction mode of heat transfer, due to the low thermal conductivity of semitransparent material. This does mean that the semitransparent window may behave as only conductive adiabatic (qc=0) or combined conductive and radiative adiabatic (qc+qr=0). In the present work, the above two thermal adiabatic boundary conditions have been investigated for natural convection in a cavity, whose left vertical wall has been divided into upper and lower parts in the ratio 4:6.

Specifically, sheet cavitation with both inception shear layer and fully cavitated shear layer and cloud cavitation under re-entrant jet dominated shedding and shock wave dominated shedding are studied. Compared with re-entrant jet, the interactions between shock wave and cavity could induce pressure peaks with high magnitude within cavity, which will collapse the local vapor along its propagating path and reduce local void fraction. Furthermore, statistics analysis shows that within the cavity, wall-pressure fluctuations increase with the distance to cavity leading edge increase in the first half of cavity length, and the moments of the probability density distribution skewness and kurtosis factor decrease, indicating the asymmetry and intermittency of wall-pressure fluctuation signals decrease.

Partial cavitation occurs when low-pressure regions caused by separated shear layers are filled with vapours. Partial cavitation is inherently unsteady and leads to periodic cloud shedding. The periodically generated re-entrant jet travelling beneath the vapour cavity is considered as one of the mechanisms responsible for the periodic cloud shedding (Callenaere et al. (2001)). However, the exact physical mechanism that drives the shedding remains unclear. The re-entrant flow exists as a thin liquid film wedged between the wall and the vapour cavity. The flow in this thin film is generally assumed to move with the same order of magnitude as the bulk flow, yet in the opposite direction. There have been several attempts to measure the velocity of the re-entrant flow to get insight into the physics of re-entrant flow and its contribution to cloud shedding. However, the flow topology of the re-entrant jet poses a major challenge to experimentally study it. The unsteady nature of the flow and the opacity of the cavitation cloud adds to the further complexity. In this work, we show that tomographic PIV (Elsinga et al.

Cavity collapse caused by cavitation can form transient characteristics such as high temperature, high pressure, strong shock wave, and high-speed micro-jet, which may cause serious damage to nearby solids. Cavitation can be affected by many intercoupled factors during the collapse transition. However, existing research rarely focuses on the analysis of its influencing factors. This research aims to reveal the collapse mechanism of cavitation, the parameters of each factor, and the influencing rules of the cavity collapse process. Molecular dynamics method was employed to analyze the evolution process of cavity collapse in the computational domain of liquid argon under different conditions. The influences of relaxation time, system temperature, and cavity size on cavity collapse were investigated. These simulation results showed that when the relaxation time was within 1\u00a0ns, the longer the relaxation time, the more likely the system molecules formed a stable state, and the more easily the cavities collapsed. When the relaxation time was greater than 0.2\u00a0ns, the difference in the process of collapse was smaller. When the temperature of the system was within 80\u00a0K, as the temperature increased, the thermal motion of the molecules intensified to increase the kinetic energy and weaken the intermolecular gravitation, shortening the time for cavities to reach the collapse point. When the temperature reached 80\u00a0K, as the temperature continued to increase, the time of collapse point and the process basically unchanged. When the initial cavity size was within 15\u00a0A, the larger the initial cavity size, the less likely the cavities tended to collapse.

As have been optimized by the nature, the microstructures inside plants may also be applied on the wick structure. In this paper, four substomatal cavity structures are chosen to investigate the influence of the structural parameters on the diffusional resistance by using Fick's first law of diffusion and the equation of mass conservation comprehensively. The result indicates that both the shape and parameters affect the diffusion, and the sphere cavity structure presents the lowest diffusional resistance because of its smoothest surface. Based on the result of the comparison, the sphere is chosen as the optimal structure of the substomatal cavity and applied on the design of the microstructure of wick. In order to analyze the performances of the substomatal cavity inspired wick structure with fractal network microchannels and sphere cavity, comparisons with the leaf vein inspired wick structure with fractal network microchannels and micro fin-pins are conducted. It is obvious to find that the substomatal cavity inspired structure is promising in the application on wick structure because of its good performances of heat and mass transfer.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3182302625"}}

The nose shape determines the cavity behavior and consequently affects the load characteristics. Each projectile used in the experiments has a truncated-cone head and a cylindrical body. The geometry of the truncated cone is defined by two dimensionless parameters. We adopt 40 kinds of head shape, while the impact velocity (41 m/s) and impact angle (30\u00b0) are kept the same. The cavity and load characteristics are investigated using a high-speed camera and an acceleration sensor, respectively. We divide the cavity dynamics into two types. In one type, the first cavity develops and coalesces with the second cavity, leading to the formation of a single continuous cavity. In the second type, the closure of the first leading cavity occurs on the truncated-cone head or the cavity may collapse onto the head in later stages, causing the two cavities develop independently without coalescence. We also find that the transient impact load and the cavity dynamics are closely related, which has not been discussed in detail in previous studies.

Coherent structures in a turbulent boundary layer have been shown to have an influence on the skin-friction drag acting on surfaces beneath the boundary layer. The use of micro-cavities on a flat surface has recently shown the potential to passively control a turbulent boundary layer by attenuating the sweep events. Previous experiments have determined the design parameters of the cavity array for the optimal boundary-layer control by reducing the sweep events. However, investigating the flow physics behind the interaction of the boundary-layer flow with the cavities is challenging. High near-wall velocity gradients and very small scales and sizes of the cavity holes limit the experiments from investigating the flow characteristics very close to the wall and inside the holes. Therefore, in the present work, direct numerical simulations have been utilized to model the boundary layer flow over a flat surface with a micro-cavity array in order to understand the flow interactions. Detection of coherent structures in the boundary layer shows a reduction in the number of events over the cavity array. Reynolds stresses have been analyzed to determine the effect of micro-cavities. The reduction in the Reynolds shear stress results in a lower skin-friction drag. The flow fluctuations through the holes in the streamwise sequence have been found to be highly correlated using cross correlation. These flow fluctuations interact with the boundary layer to suppress the coherent structures. Overall, the use of the micro-cavity array has resulted in a reduced wall shear stress and approximately 5.6% lower local skin-friction drag.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3186328228"}}

The fluid flow and pressure ripples are one of the key factors that reduce durability and control accuracy of the hydraulic mechanical systems. The most effective method to suppress pulsations in wide frequency range is to use a semiactive resonant-type pulsation damper, which natural frequency changes in real time due to a stepless change in the volume of its cavity using a special actuator-drive. However, the change in the dynamic characteristics of the resonator with a change in the volume of its cavity is currently poorly understood. Therefore, the main purpose of this work is to determine the dynamic characteristics of the adaptive Helmholtz resonator with variable cavity volume. The cavity volume of the investigated pulsation damper changes due to the movement of the rod with the piston. The compliance of the cavity design was taken into account with the view to correct the value of the cavity volume. The corrected volume of the cavity is the internal volume of the cavity with absolutely rigid walls, the compressibility of the working fluid in which is equal to the compliance of the real cavity design filled with fluid, due to the compressibility of the fluid and increase in the volume of the cavity due to deformation of the walls. The corrected cavity volume was obtained using numerical methods. A static structural analysis of the resonator cavity was performed by ANSYS Workbench environment. As a result of this study, the dependences of the corrected cavity volumes on the position of the rod were obtained for two cases: with and without taking into account the compliance of the rod. The obtained dependences show that: the dynamic characteristics of the cavity significantly depend on the position of the piston due to a change in the compliance of the resonator barrel; the dynamic characteristics of the cavity significantly depend on the compliance of the rod. The results of this study can be used as the basis for the development and implementation of an automatic control system of the adaptive Helmholtz resonator.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4317826860"}}

A cavity of length to depth ratio $[L/D]=2$ at a freestream Mach number of $M_\\infty = 1.71$ is considered to be in a confined passage. Impinging shock strength is controlled by changing the ramp angle ($\\theta$) on the top-wall. The static pressure ratio across the impinging shock ($p_2/p_1$) is used to quantify the impinging shock strength. Five different impinging shock strengths are studied by changing the pressure ratio: $1.0,1.2,1.5,1.7$ and $2.0$. As the pressure ratio increases from 1.0 to 2.0, the cavity wall experiences a maximum pressure of 25% due to shock loading.

The pressure field in discharge chambers of a limited volume with deformable walls very often has a great influence on the efficiency of technological processes of deformation of sheet alloys; therefore, its determination is an urgent task. As a result of an electric discharge in the liquid filling the discharge chamber, in it, a cavity with a higher compressibility is formed than the liquid in the chamber. At the stage of the discharge, this cavity is filled with non-ideal plasma, and after the discharge, with liquid vapor and gases dissolved in it (vapor-gas cavity). Its pulsations form a pressure field in the discharge chamber. The moving boundary of the vapor-gas cavity creates great problems in calculating the pressure field in a liquid, especially after a large number of its pulsations. At present, the role of the vapor-gas cavity in the formation of the pressure field in the discharge chamber with a deformable wall, which is a sheet alloy plate, is insufficiently studied. Its definition is the purpose of this work. The study was carried out on the base of a previously developed mathematical model of an electric discharge in water, which in this work is supplemented with relations that significantly increase the accuracy of calculating the resistance of the discharge channel and the energy released in it. It was determined that the pulsations of the vapor-gas cavity provide pressure fluctuations in it in an antiphase with the average pressure in the liquid. In a discharge chamber with rigid walls, they decay slowly, but the presence of a deformable wall leads to a rapid decay of pressure fluctuations. In the previously developed mathematical model, the change in the optical transparency of the plasma was taken into account, and its significant effect on the pressure in the cavity and the pressure field in the liquid was determined.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3166517521"}}

Similar to that of the inhomogeneity problems, the implementation of the EIM for the cavity problem is conducted by treating a cavity whose elastic modulus is zero as an inclusion having identical material properties to the matrix but containing eigenstrains. Based on an elementary solution for the eigenstress arising from the eigenstrains representing the cavity of an arbitrary shape can be calculated with the help of numerical discretization and superposition of contributions from each discretized element. A circular or rectangular cavity can be reduced to a crack when the distance between their upper and lower surfaces approaches an infinitesimal but not a zero value, hence the elastic field caused by cracks can be also resolved with the proposed solution method.

In such a scenario, the upper width and depth of the cavity collectively promote the droplet transition into the Cassie state from the Wenzel state, but the effect of the upper width and depth on the contact angle is opposite, and the decrease of the upper width of the cavity is the dominant factor, which leads to a decrease in the contact angle.

Then, the effects of boundary-layer thickness at the cavity entrance on flow characteristics and aerodynamic surface quantities are analyzed in depth. The concept of total-enthalpy boundary layer successfully identifies the boundary-layer edge while the traditional boundary layer based on velocity fails to captures the shock-wave front due to the presence of the weak shock wave in the rarefied hypersonic flow past a flat plate. The boundary-layer thickness at the cavity entrance has strong effects on the flow past the 2D cavity. As the boundary layer at the cavity entrance becomes thicker, the external stream can penetrate deeper into the cavity and transfer more momentum and energy to the cavity, so the cavity flow develops gradually from an open flow to a transitional one and ultimately to a closed one.

Flows over the cavity configurations specified in the study hold the \u201copen-cavity\u201d characteristics and do not show any unsteadiness. The rounded separation corner does not significantly alter the flow patterns, while the rounded reattachment corner has a remarkable effect. Rounding the separation and reattachment corners can weaken the baroclinic effect in the separation and reattachment regions, respectively. For the rounded separation corner, it is easier for external gas molecules to enter the cavity and hence promote the momentum and energy exchanges with gas molecules inside the cavity. The fluid density inside the cavity, peak density at the reattachment point, pressure on and heat fluxes to the cavity floor are augmented, compared to those in the rectangular cavity case. However, the rounded reattachment corner may enhance the escape of gas molecules from the cavity and weaken the exchanges of momentum and energy. This leads to a significant decrease in the gas density inside the cavity, peak gas density at the reattachment point, pressure on and heat fluxes to the cavity floor.

The torque normalized by that on the particle in an unbounded identical fluid vanishes as \u03b2wb\u2215\u03b7=0 (the cavity wall is fully slip), equals unity for a value of \u03b2wb\u2215\u03b7 very close to 3, and in general increases with an increase in \u03b2wb\u2215\u03b7 (or the stickiness of the cavity wall). When \u03b2wb\u2215\u03b7>3, the normalized torque is in general greater than unity, an increasing/decreasing function of the eccentricity parameter d\u2215(b\u2212a) if the value of \u03b2a\u2215\u03b7 (or the stickiness of the particle surface) is large/small, and an increasing function of \u03b2a\u2215\u03b7 and a\u2215b.

Abstract Non-synchronous pressure and temperature fluctuations at the hub cavity of a turbine stage are the main focus of this study. Cavity modes are unsteady fluctuations generated at the cavity exit due to instabilities in this region. The cavity modes carried into the main flow impose an unsteady flow field in the rotor passages, which varies the passage-wise flow parameters considerably. A two-stage axial turbine was designed and tested in the \u201cLISA\u201d test facility at ETH Zurich. A reference case with baseline geometry and a modified case with an axial deflector at the hub cavity exit were tested. Comprehensive unsteady pressure and temperature measurements were performed using fast response aerodynamic (FRAP) and entropy probes (FENT), respectively. In addition, 12 fast response unsteady pressure transducers were mounted on the stationary wall of the cavity exit to measure the main characteristic parameters of the cavity modes. Full annular unsteady simulations were also carried out for both cases to support the experiments. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) successfully predicted the effect of cavity modes on both frequency and amplitude of the fluctuations. The cavity modes indicated fluctuation amplitudes up to eight times of the blade passing fluctuations at the cavity exit. The analysis shows that the convected cavity modes alter the efficiency of different rotor passages by redistributing the mass flow and the losses resulting in a drop in overall efficiency. This work suggests that implementing a small axial deflector at the hub cavity exit would completely eliminate the cavity modes leading to a reduced pressure unsteadiness and enhanced efficiency.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3126301754"}}

We develop a semi-empirical or semi-analytical model based on the spherical cavity expansion theory in order to simulate the normal penetration of tandem warheads into concrete targets, which consist of two stages: penetration into a cavity region (or damaged region), and subsequent penetration into an undamaged region. To formulate the semi-empirical model, we consider the first impact of rigid projectiles on the damaged region with a pre-drilled cavity and the second on the undamaged region. For the penetration into the undamaged region corresponding to the second stage, an empirical constant used in the semi-empirical model is determined based on the penetration depth obtained by experiments in the literature. The semi-empirical model is then verified by comparing its results to experimental data and numerical results of the explicit finite element method (FEM) in terms of kinematic quantities of projectiles. For the penetration into damaged concrete targets in which a cavity is considered as a pre-drilled hole, which provides a basis of the formulation for the first stage, the results of the semi-empirical model are compared to experimental data, and an empirical constant is also estimated based on the numerical results of the explicit FEM. Finally, the concrete targets with a finite-length cavity, into which a tandem warhead penetrates, can be regarded as a combination of the damaged region with a finite-length cavity and the undamaged region. In the semi-empirical model for the penetration of tandem warheads, the empirical constants for the first and second stages are employed as those estimated for the damaged region with a cavity of finite length and for the undamaged region, respectively. The results from the semi-empirical model are compared with those from the explicit FEM due to the lack of experimental data. The good agreement of the results of the semi-empirical model and the explicit FEM demonstrates that the proposed semi-empirical model can predict the dynamic behavior of the tandem warheads in a simple and accurate manner.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3096030791"}}

Full compressibility of two phases and an energy equation are used to determine the effects of temperature on a cavitating flow. First, the experimental data were validated at a cavitation number of \u03c3 = 0.435. Both quantitatively and qualitatively good agreements were achieved, including the evolution of the cavity shape, cavity length, and cavity thickness. Then, the key characteristics of an unsteady cavitation structure regarding the cavity growth, re-entrant jet, cavity shedding, and collapse were analyzed. In particular, the mechanism of the re-entrant jet inside the cavity, causing the periodic cavity shedding, was explored. Furthermore, detailed mechanisms of cavity shedding with periodic cavity\u2013vortex\u2013pressure interaction behaviors were analyzed.

The effect of fluid depth on the collapse of large cavities generated by over-driven axisymmetric gravity waves in a 10 cm diameter cylindrical container has been studied. At a large fluid depth in a viscous glycerine\u2013water solution, the collapse of the cavities is inertia dominant at the initial phase with the time-dependent cavity radius (rm) obeying rm \u221d \u03c41/2; \u03c4 = t \u2212 t0 being the time remaining for collapse, with t0 being the time at collapse. However, enhanced damping at a low liquid depth turns the late stage of the transition into the viscous regime (rm \u221d \u03c4) at some critical depth beyond which a singular collapse (transition from non-pinch-off and pinch-off collapse) is impossible. At a shallow depth, the change in cavity radius follows a flip of the power law, i.e., rm \u221d \u03c4 at the initial stage of collapse followed by a transition to rm \u221d \u03c41/2, suggesting a viscous\u2013inertial transition. For fluids with relatively lower viscosity but similar surface tension, here water, a smoother cavity with damped parasitic waves at a small liquid depth collapses at a smaller radius. The surface jet velocity due to the collapse of the cavity monotonically decreases with the decrease in the depth, whereas in the case of water, it increases with the depth reaching a maximum at a critical depth followed by a decrease again.

Currently, the widely accepted method to suppress pressure pulsations is the use of resonant-type pulsation dampers. However, at the moment it is impossible to specify the resonant cavity impedance without any special experimental studies. Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop the mathematical model for the accurate of the dynamic characteristics of the cavity filled with fluid. The mathematical model that takes into account the compliance of the cavity design is described. The compliance of the cavity design was taken into account with the view to correct the value of cavity volume. The corrected volume of the cavity is the internal volume of the cavity with absolutely rigid walls, the compressibility of the working fluid in which is equal to the compliance of the real cavity design filled with fluid, due to the compressibility of the fluid and increase in the volume of the cavity due to deformation of the walls. The corrected cavity volume was obtained using numerical methods. In this study, a static structural analysis of the damper cavity was performed by ANSYS Workbench environment. A comparison of the calculated and experimental values of the corrected cavity volume demonstrated their good convergence.

A high-speed camera is used to observe cavity and jet formations, and the resulting data is used to measure important parameters such as jet height, deep-seal time and deep-seal depth of the cavity.

Additionally, an energy analysis is done for better understanding how kinetic energy of the sphere is transferred to the fluid. In the case of an oil film on water, the sphere lost its kinetic energy much more than when the target liquid was silicone oil or water.

This solution can be used, for example, in the development of approximate approaches for projectiles penetrating with a non-constant velocity into different targets. Due to the complexity of the nonlinear nonstationary problem, an analytical solution of the problem may be developed if simplified constitutive relationships are used. In the present model, a simplified material model with a locked equation of state and a linear shear failure relationship is implemented. This solution may be applied to different materials such as concrete, soil, and rock. Special cases of the newly developed nonstationary solution are compared with different spherical and cylindrical cavity expansions solutions reported in the literature, and a good agreement is obtained.

This study synchronously investigated the cavity behavior and its corresponding wall static pressure characteristics in Venturi channels with various divergence angles to research the role of the divergence angle in cavity shape and the wall static pressure oscillation. Five rectangular Venturi channels with different divergence angles (4\u00b0, 6\u00b0, 8\u00b0, 10\u00b0, and 12\u00b0) were tested at the cavitation number (0.3\u20131.0).

A modified correlation for predicting average cavity length was proposed with the consideration of the effect of the divergence angle. Combined with the wall static pressure characteristics, as the divergence angle increased, the wall static pressure fluctuation in the Venturi became more intense. According to the wall static pressure oscillation characteristics, for the larger divergence angles ( \u03b8 = 6\u00b0, 8\u00b0, 10\u00b0 and 12\u00b0), the wall static pressure oscillation frequency was the same as the cavity shedding frequency and increased with the increase of the divergence angle.

Abstract When high-velocity penetrator impacts and penetrates a liquid-filled container such as an aircraft fuel tank, the hydrodynamic ram (HRAM) event occurs. This process could be roughly divided into four phases, each of which could cause different degrees of damage to the liquid-filled container or the surrounding equipment. Spherical fragment impacting tests of different velocities were performed on two sizes of liquid-filled containers to investigate the effect of boundary constraints on cavity growth. The velocity range in the experiment was from 600 m/s to 1400 m/s. Through theoretical analysis and experimental results, it is found that the radial disturbance range of the cavity is not constant in different containers and under different impact velocities. An improved method is presented to modeling the cavity growth in the drag-cavity phases of HRAM events. The approach quantitatively describes the radial disturbance range of the cavity and is appropriate for the calculation of the cavity growth in HRAM. Moreover, the effect of liquid type on cavity growth is studied theoretically.

The main purpose of this work is to shed light on the physics involved in the two distinct cavity cloud shedding mechanisms in cloud cavitating flows, namely re-entrant jet mechanism (RJM) and shock wave propagation mechanism (SWM). A compressible cavitating flow solver, which considers the compressibility effects of both liquid and vapor, is used to account for the wave dynamics in cavitating flows. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations, coupling the mass, momentum energy equations, and phase fraction transport equation, along with the thermodynamic equations of state for both liquid and vapor, Saito cavitation model and the SST-SAS turbulence model, are solved. Numerical results are presented for the conditions of both the re-entrant jet mechanism and shock wave mechanism around a NACA66 (mod) hydrofoil (Leroux et al., 2005), respectively, with emphasis on the process of re-entrant jet development and shock wave formation and propagation. The results show that the re-entrant jet can cause the attached cavity sheet breakup for both the two cavity cloud shedding mechanisms in both high and low angle of attack, while the shock wave formation and propagation process only occurs under shock wave mechanism at low angles of attack. Pressure evolution illustrates that in the re-entrant jet mechanism, cavity cloud collapse will induce high pressure load, while no shock wave and thus the corresponding rebound phenomenon are observed. In shock wave mechanism, during the whole process of the shock wave dynamics, namely generation, propagation and rebound process, pressure fluctuations increase sharply along with the generation of the pressure peaks with large amplitude and short time interval. Further study on the compressible characteristics involved in the two cavity shedding mechanisms illustrates that vapor fraction and mass transfer have a significant effect in sonic speed and Mach number characteristics. The average and standard derivation of maximum Mach number (Mamax) in shock wave mechanism is lower than that in re-entrant jet mechanism. Cavitating flows are characterized by low sonic speed value in the cavitation region and high sonic speed value in the pure liquid region and a sonic speed boundary layer exists between the two regions, the thickness of which is about the size of the local attached cavity sheet on foil surface.

Through the quasi-periodic evolution of the cavity, combined with the contour of streamwise velocity and pressure, the main characteristics and physical signs of the re-entrant jet and bubbly shock mechanisms are studied. The effect of the pressure ratio on the shedding mechanism is also studied. It was found that, in a Venturi reactor with a long throat, the evolution of cavitation is divided into an inception stage, a development stage, two shedding stages, and a collapse stage. The main characteristic of the shedding mechanism induced by the re-entrant jet is the separation between the cavity and the wall. The physical sign of this type of shedding is the axial fracture of the whole cavity. Shedding induced by the re-entrant jet dominates the first shedding in the diffusion section. The main characteristic of the bubbly shock shedding mechanism is damage to the cavity caused by pressure waves or shocks, which accelerates cavity shedding and restrains cavity development.

A straight cavity with an optimum depth at the rear base of a vehicle is a well-known technique used to alter the mean wake topology and achieve drag reduction[1]. For two dimensional bluff bodies, a multi-cavity is known to deliver better drag reduction at shorter cavity depths in comparison to a single cavity[2]. With this viewpoint, a numerical investigation is carried out to examine the performance of a multi-cavity over a single cavity in drag reduction for a three-dimensional bluff body vehicle model. The numerical simulations are performed at Reynolds Number (Re) = 1 \u00d7 105 using the k-\u03c9 SSTSAS turbulence model in a Finite volume open-source code OpenFOAM. The investigations revealed, for any cavity depth, a single cavity always performed better than multi-cavity in reducing drag. However, at optimum cavity depth equal to 33% of the body height, the drag reduction magnitude was identical for both the flow controls. The plausible mechanisms responsible for their relative difference in performance will be explored by analyzing the base pressure distribution, wake mean topology, and the temporal behavior of the wake.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3172009500"}}

In the present work, the effects of diffuse and collimated radiation on the symmetrical cooling case of natural convection in a two-dimensional cavity heated from the bottom have been investigated, numerically. The cavity is convectively heated from the bottom with heat transfer coefficient of 50 W/m2K and free stream temperature 305 K, while both vertical walls of cavity are isothermal at temperature of 296 K. The top wall is adiabatic and all walls are opaque for radiation heat transfer. For collimated case, a small semitransparent window of non-dimensional width of 0.05 at height of 0.7 has been created on the left wall and a collimated irradiation of value 1000 W/m2 at an angle 45 is applied on this semitransparent window. The results reveal that the diffuse radiation has little effect on the dynamics of two rolls inside the cavity, however, collimated beam irradiation changes the dynamics of two rolls significantly and also the heat transfer characteristics. This further changes with the optical thickness of the fluid. The left vortex is bigger in size than the right vortex for collimated beam in transparent fluid, whereas, reverse trend is seen for collimated beam in non-zero optical thickness of the fluid.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3041316346"}}

This paper describes an experimental investigation of the cavity evolution and shedding wake behind a hydrophobic sphere during the water-entry process. Two distinct shedding phenomena are confirmed by varying the impact velocity and sphere size: regular air-bubble shedding and unstable air-cloud shedding. Both of these modes are highly dependent on the Weber and Bond numbers. Under the air-bubble shedding mode, approximately periodic big bubble shedding and low-frequency oscillation signals are observed. The relationship between big bubble shedding events and the corresponding acoustic signals is derived, and an empirical method for predicting the shedding period is proposed. The in-phase relationship between small bubble shedding and cavity rippling is confirmed, and we refer to the cavity shedding phenomenon as \u201cacoustic\u201d shedding. Unlike the observations of air-bubble shedding, the air-cloud shedding mode produces a group of disordered small bubbles from the rear of the cavity. Moreover, the cavity seal type has a significant effect on the cavity shedding mode. A deep seal always promotes the onset of air-cloud shedding, whereas surface seals with relatively low Bond numbers result in the air-bubble shedding mode. A surface seal suppresses resonance in the cavity volume. By observing the cavity motion, we find that air-cloud shedding is always accompanied by severe cavity resonance and a rapid decrease in cavity length.

In the slip-flow regime for the gas motion, the thermal creep, thermal stress slip, frictional slip, and temperature jump are permitted at the solid surfaces. The general solutions to the conservative equations governing the temperature and fluid velocity distributions in the two spherical coordinate systems with respect to the particle and cavity centers are superimposed, and the boundary conditions are satisfied by a collocation technique. The translational and angular velocities of the particle are determined as functions of the scaled center-to-center distance between the particle and cavity (eccentricity of the particle position), their radius ratio, and their relative thermal and surface properties. The results indicate that the boundary effect on the thermophoretic motion is significant, interesting, and complicated. When the particle is located at the cavity center, its migration velocity agrees well with the available analytical solution. In general, the thermophoretic mobility decreases with increases in the particle-to-cavity size ratio and in the normalized distance between the particle and cavity centers, but there exist some exceptions. The circulating cavity-induced thermoosmotic flow can increase or decrease the thermophoretic migration and retard the particle rotation, even reverse their directions, depending on the geometric and characteristic parameters.

The presence of these coherent turbulent structures within the cavity plays a major role for momentum and mass transfers between the outer layer and the core region of the recirculation cell within the cavity.

Along their trajectory, they can split into smaller vortices and/or merge with others. Moreover, whereas the vortex shedding in the mixing layer is highly periodic, the entering of vortices in the cavity is intermittent.

Abstract The phenomenon of natural convection is investigated in three-dimensional (3D) cavities with four adiabatic walls and one hot wall. The surface opposite to the hot wall is either a wall (closed cavity) at a lower constant temperature or is open to ambient at a lower temperature (open cavity). It is pointed out here that not only overall heat transfer is important, the distribution of local heat transfer is also important. To quantify the uniformity of heat transfer distribution, the ratio of maximum to average heat transfer is calculated for various Rayleigh numbers as well as inclination angles for open and closed cavities. A significant difference in the local heat transfer profile along the hot surface of the closed cavity in comparison to that in open cavity for small inclination angle (especially at higher values of Rayleigh number) is noted. However, the profile is remarkably similar in the case of vertical cavities. For inclined closed cavities, there is a buoyancy component of the flow acceleration normal to the hot and cold wall, which is absent in the case of vertical cavities. For lower inclinations, this component brings the three-dimensionality in the flow field and leads to the differences in the flow patterns. The fluid striking the cold wall in the case of the closed cavity causes significantly different flow patterns that, in turn, lead to nonuniform local heat transfer. To explain the flow behavior, iso-surfaces, stream ribbons, and the Y-components of the flow velocity are plotted at different surfaces of the closed cavity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2995862676"}}

The study is inspired by the ventilation and gas-exchange process within the chimneys of open-vent termite mounds. Large-eddy simulations are conducted over an idealized termite mound subject to different thermal stratifications that are formed based on the observed mean day and night-time air and mound nest temperatures reported in the literature. A thorough analysis of the flow, temperature, and scalar fields indicates that the dynamics of the flow and the ventilation process within the cavity are controlled by the combined effects of the cavity entrance vortex and the stability condition within the lower regions of the cavity. The results show that, despite the small differences in the imposed stratification condition, the ventilation capacity is significantly higher in unstable conditions, owing to the stronger suction at the cavity entrance, together with the positive buoyant forces at the lower sections of the cavity. The results are in agreement with experimental observations of termite mounds in nature.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3002054786"}}

This paper studies the acoustic radiation force of a rigid sphere positioned in a fluid-filled cylindrical cavity with an abruptly changed cross-section. This cavity consists of a semi-infinite front tube and a coaxially connected semi-infinite rear tube with different cross-sectional area through a transverse planar junction. Considering a plane wave propagates along the cavity, the exact expression of the acoustic radiation force exerted on the sphere in the front tube is deduced. The effects of the distance between the sphere and the planar junction and the radius ratio of the front tube to the rear tube on acoustic radiation force are analyzed. Numerical results show that the distance influences the acoustic radiation force periodically. Both the distance and the radius ratio of the tubes affect the magnitude and the direction of acoustic radiation force.

In this paper, a natural convection study of an open square cavity is carried out in order to understand the heat transfer and the fluid flow inside the cavity. The rectangular cavity considered in this work has a square cross section and is made of two adiabatic walls and an isothermal wall. The thermally active wall is maintained at a relatively higher temperature than the ambient temperature. Experiments are performed for three different Rayleigh numbers for five different inclinations (from side wall open to top wall open) with air (Pr = 0.71) as the working fluid. A nonintrusive optical technique (Mach-Zehnder interferometer) is employed to capture the depth-averaged two-dimensional steady-state temperature field in the cavity. In addition to that, smoke visualization is also carried out to see the flow behavior inside the cavity. The physics of fluid flow has been discussed with the help of interferograms, corresponding two-dimensional temperature field, and smoke visualization results. The losses due to natural convection at different orientations have been quantified and are presented in terms of Nusselt numbers on the thermally active wall. The average heat transfer rates on the thermally active wall are found to be dependent on the orientation of the cavity. As the cavity is rotated such that the open face moves from the side to top, it is noted that the average Nusselt number decreases. However, when the opening of the cavity is at the top, there is a sudden increment in heat transfer due to Rayleigh-Benard convection in the cavity. The experimentally obtained average Nusselt numbers have been compared with those obtained by numerical simulations and good agreement between these two results is seen. The study reveals that higher driving potential for the higher angle of inclination led to higher heat transfer.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3002537650"}}

Overall, for all cases, the cavity bubble expands to the maximum size and shrinks steeply with increasing Ts. At higher Ts, the cavity is destroyed significantly, even smaller than the reference case. However, the detailed interaction between the cavity and laser-induced cavitation bubbles is quite different. In a shallow-seal case, nucleate boiling occurs on the sphere surface and vapor bubbles merge into the cavity, resulting in the expansion of the cavity.

As the impact speed increases (for a deep-seal condition), the flux of entrained air becomes dominant and the stage of cavity expansion is quite narrow. As Ts increases, the heated cavity collapses into microbubbles and almost 90% is destroyed. Finally, we investigate the effects of modified cavity on hydrodynamic forces on the sphere.

Abstract Cavitation may develop on upward-launched submerged objects approaching sea surface with high speed. In this work, the cavitation shedding and collapse during the water-exit of an axisymmetric projectile is investigated using large eddy simulation (LES). High resolution is guaranteed by carefully fulfilling the requisites of y+&lt;1, \u0394x+&lt;100, and \u0394z+&lt;40 to resolve at least 80% of the turbulent kinetic energy. The result indicates that the cavity in growth is always undeveloped as the ambient hydrostatic pressure keeps decreasing. The cavity is pushed by the water surface to shed downward and keep shrinking until its final collapse. The vapor inside cavity during the water-exit process is separated by a layer of water so as not to mix with the air. The front of the re-entrant jet barely catches up with the moving wall, and the cavity is pinched off by the joint effect of the jet front and water surface. It is also found that the angle of attack (AOA) generates inversely inclined liquid-vapor contact lines of the cavity leading edge and cavity closure. The advancing contact lines finally intersect on the pressure side to make the cavity break off, which can cause noticeable pressure impulse on the break-off spot. The pressure feature of the water-exit cavitation evolution is studied with intensively arranged monitor points on the wall, which can sense pressure peaks when the liquid-vapor contact lines sweep over them.

The energy and momentum equations are solved using two spherical coordinate frames with respect to the cavity and particle and the boundary conditions at the solid surfaces are satisfied by a collocation method. Results of the thermophoretic velocity are obtained for various values of the relative thermal and surface properties of the particle and cavity, their radius ratio, as well as the normalized distance between their centers (eccentricity of the particle position). In the particular case of the migration of a spherical particle at the center of the cavity, these results agree excellently with the analytical solutions. Interestingly, the contribution to the particle velocity from the thermoosmotic flow at the cavity wall can be equivalent to or even much more important than that from the wall-corrected thermophoretic driving force. The dimensionless thermophoretic velocity of the confined particle decreases significantly with an increase in the normalized distance between the particle and cavity centers or the particle-to-cavity radius ratio. This velocity increases with an increase in the relative thermal conductivity of the solid phases for a specified configuration.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2944754186"}}

An analytical method is proposed for computing the low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamic mobility function of a small colloidal particle asymmetrically moving inside a large spherical elastic cavity, the membrane of which is endowed with resistance toward shear and bending. In conjunction with the results obtained in the first part (A. Daddi-Moussa-Ider, H. L\u00f6wen, S. Gekle, Eur. Phys. J. E 41, 104 (2018)), in which the axisymmetric motion normal to the surface of an elastic cavity is investigated, the general motion for an arbitrary force direction can now be addressed. The elastohydrodynamic problem is formulated and solved using the classic method of images through expressing the hydrodynamic flow fields as a multipole expansion involving higher-order derivatives of the free-space Green's function. In the quasi-steady limit, we demonstrate that the particle self-mobility function of a particle moving tangent to the surface of the cavity is larger than that predicted inside a rigid stationary cavity of equal size. This difference is justified by the fact that a stationary rigid cavity introduces additional hindrance to the translational motion of the encapsulated particle, resulting in a reduction of its hydrodynamic mobility. Furthermore, the motion of the cavity is investigated, revealing that the translational pair (composite) mobility, which linearly couples the velocity of the elastic cavity to the force exerted on the solid particle, is solely determined by membrane shear properties.

However, in the current study, it is found that the location of the subcavity and its dimensions play a crucial role in determining the types of oscillations existing inside the cavity. Cavity models with a subcavity length to main cavity length of 0.2 (l/L = 0.20) were investigated by placing the subcavity at the front wall, aft wall, and simultaneously at both front and aft walls. High speed schlieren visualization revealed the presence of different shock features associated with the cavity flow field. Statistical techniques such as fast Fourier transform, spectrogram, coherence, and correlation are employed to analyze the unsteady pressure data. Numerical computations are carried out to validate the experimental results and also to explore the flow physics.

This passive strategy has been hardly studied in shallow cavities with length-to-depth ratios of the order of 10, for which flow reattachment might occur at the cavity floor. This implies the formation of a localized recirculation bubble upstream in the cavity, which is referred to as a closed cavity flow regime. An open flow regime takes place when the cavity is separated from the main flow by a shear layer over the full length. For a transitional case with a length-to-depth ratio of 10.6, micro-perforating the cavity floor reduces by up to 8 dB the dominant spectral peaks related to the bottom wall-pressure fluctuations in the first half of the cavity.

The problem is considered for a thin laminar boundary layer before the cavity and with the Reynolds number of Re = 2 \u22c5 104, based on the cavity chord. The obtained results indicate that the cavity flow oscillates in the shear-layer mode and radiates a dipole in the far acoustic field so that the sound intensity in the backward direction is higher than in the forward direction. The effectiveness of controlling of the flow oscillations by applying steady suction through the rear cavity wall is studied. The results show that the suction allows us to localize the vortical flow inside the cavity when saving the mode of self-sustained oscillations in the shear layer. The vortices generated in the shear layer do not hit the trailing edge now but are absorbed by the suction causing the rise of pressure fluctuations in the vicinity of suction point. As a result, the obtained levels of radiated sound are much higher than in the uncontrolled cavity flow.

In this paper, the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) which is one of the most successful particle simulation methods in treating rarefied gas dynamics is employed to investigate the flow characteristics of the cavity with a length-to-depth ratio of 1\u20138, a rearwall-to-frontwall height ratio of 0.5\u20132, and an inclined frontwall ranging from 20\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 for the free stream at a Mach number of 8 and an altitude of 60 km. The simulation results indicate that the shear layer and recirculation region within the cavity are changed greatly by varying length-to-depth ratio and the cavity is transformed into a closed type at the length-to-depth ratio of 6. For the cavity with a fixed length-to-depth ratio, the increase in rearwall height would push the shear layer away from cavity floor and hence increases the area of recirculation region. Conversely, the decrease in rearwall height would draw the shear layer into the interior of the cavity and finally the recirculation region would be split into two smaller and separated ones located at the left and right corners of the cavity respectively. A significant finding is that the criterion (i.e., length-to-depth ratio) for classifying the cavity type is not a constant but changes with freestream conditions.

This paper concerns with the problem of natural convection heat transfer inside an industrial oven with an internal plate. The model is simulated numerically as a square cavity with an isolated plate laid horizontally or vertically inside it. Different ranges of Rayleigh number from laminar to turbulent flow regimes were investigated numerically and inherent flow structures and the amount of transferred heat were obtained. The governing Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and energy equations are discretized and solved applying finite-volume method. Moreover, a two-layer zonal model is applied for near-wall turbulent properties. Comparing the present results with similar previous studies and experimental data shows that the employed zonal model is more accurate than other existing turbulent models. Our results also demonstrate that the total rate of heat transferred by a cavity with internal isolated plate is always lower than that of a bare cavity. As the distance of internal plate from the cavity wall decreases, its effect on the reduction of overall heat transfer increases accordingly. We also determined a distance between the plate and the cavity wall with less than 2% change in relative Nusselt number and deduced that the maximum distance of vertical plate is always greater than that of the horizontal plate at each Rayleigh number. Furthermore, a dead zone is created between the hot wall and the plate with low velocities, the temperatures close to the hot wall temperature, and very weak circulation, which can significantly reduce the overall heat transfer in the cavity.

The behavior of the system is considered within the framework of a nonlinear multimode model of a joint reservoir and liquid movement.An important class of problems is the generalization of the classical Faraday problem for a reservoir with a liquid that carries a given motion in the vertical direction. Such a generalization is carried out in three directions: the movement of the system \"reservoir - liquid\" is carried out with the provision of additional degrees of freedom, for example, the permissible movement of the system in the horizontal direction, or the angular movement of the reservoir; unlike the classical Faraday problem, the problem is considered in a joint statement; cases are considered not only cylindrical shape of the reservoir, but also other forms. Such generalizations correspond to the problems of longitudinal motion of aircraft, vessels, when there is no fixing of the structure of the reservoir with a liquid, and the joint movement takes place.The task is to investigate the behavior of the system \"reservoir - a liquid with a free surface\" when harmonious excitement of motion by force applied to the reservoir.

Experiments were conducted in the 10\u00b0 divergent section with a ventilation slit near the throat, using a simultaneous sampling technique to synchronize the transient cavity behaviors with wall-pressure signals. Results are presented at a Reynolds number 9.33 \u00d7 105 and Froude number 10.24 for (1) under re-entrant flow mechanism (\u03c3 = 0.81) characterized by the intermittent shedding of small-scale cavities, and (2) under bubbly shock propagation mechanism (\u03c3 = 0.70) characterized by periodic large-scale cavity cloud shedding, with three non-dimensional air injection volumetric flow rates, namely 0, 1.135 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 2.270 \u00d7 10\u22123. The results show that air injection from the throat into the shear layer can significantly suppress cavitation induced unsteady pressure fluctuations. With the increasing of air flow rate, the size of the attached sheet cavity and the shedding cavity clusters grows larger, and the distance between the new attached sheet cavity and the shedding cavity cloud decreases, resulting in the cavitation region misty.

For a liner consisting of an array of deep cavities periodically placed along a duct containing a mean shear flow, the acoustic and hydrodynamic disturbances are described by the linearized Euler equations. The Bloch modes and the scattering matrix of periodic cells are used to examine the instability over the liner. The unstable Bloch mode is due to the coupling of a hydrodynamic mode in the shear flow with the cavity resonance. It is demonstrated that even when all the transverse modes are stable in the duct\u2013cavity system, i.e. when the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz instability of the shear flow over the cavities does not occur, such an instability over the liner can still exist. The unstable Bloch wave, excited by the incident sound wave at the upstream part of the liner, convectively grows along the liner, and regenerates sound near the downstream edge of the liner with a sound level higher than the incident sound level.

For some combinations of Ra and cavity inclinations, the Nusselt numbers are significantly lower in the cubic cavity compared to that of the square cavity, while for other combinations, it is quite the opposite. To understand the cause of these variations, a detailed study of the flow patterns is carried out for different Ra and cavity inclination angles. It is seen that for a lower range of Ra, the finiteness of the cavity reduces the flow, resulting in lower heat transfer for the 3D cavity when compared to the 2D cavity. Similar results are seen for larger inclination angles of the cavity (hot wall close to the vertical) even for higher Ra. However, for the cases with higher Ra and small inclination angles (hot wall close to the horizontal), the flow becomes three-dimensional. The three-dimensionality in the flow is attributed to the weak convection currents that rise from the side adiabatic walls and go down from the center of the cavity. The combination of these convection currents with the predominantly strong convection currents, which are going up from the hot wall, results in the complex three dimensional flow patterns. Due to this phenomenon, the cubic cavity with such a configuration has significantly higher Nusselt number compared to that of the square cavity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2885233854"}}

Experiments are conducted in the divergent section with a ventilation slit downstream the throat of a convergent-divergent channel, using high-speed camera to visualize the transient cavity behaviors. Results are presented for the sheet/cloud cavitation characterized by the periodic large-scale cavity cloud being shed at a cavitation number of \u03c3=0.8 and the Reynold number of Re=0.97\u00d7106, for three normalized air injection volume flow rates, namely CI=0, 1.135\u00d710\u22123 and 2.270\u00d710\u22123. The results show that air injection can significantly influence the unsteady sheet/cloud cavity behaviors. With the increase of the air injection rate, the length of the attached cavity sheet and the size of the shedding cavity cloud increase. During the attached cavity sheet breakup and being shed process, the distance between the new partial cavity sheet and the shedding cavity cloud increase. The power spectral density (PSD) of the cavity area (Scav/Sthroat) indicates that, with the increase of the air injection rate, the cavitation cycle decreases and the spectral content attenuates, especially the low spectral between 0-20 Hz which is supposed to be induced by unsteady sheet/cloud cavitation.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2887824087"}}

To this end, we consider a neighboring cavity in which a cavitation bubble is absent. We derive equations that describe the disturbance of the liquid pressure inside the second cavity, assuming this disturbance to be caused by the cavitation process in the first cavity. The developed theory is then used to perform numerical simulations.

The nonlinear partial differential equations are solved by employing a robust Galerkin finite element scheme. The pressure term in this scheme is eliminated by using the penalty method. The results are exhibited in the form of streamlines, isotherms, and local and average Nusselt numbers for two cases, namely, the constant and the sinusoidal heated lower wall of the conduit. In both cases, the side walls of the cavity are cold and the upper side is insulated. The main difference between the two cases is observed from temperature contours. For constant heated bottom wall a finite discontinuity appears in the temperature distribution at the corners of the bottom wall. In contrast, no such discontinuity appears in the temperature distribution for non-uniform heated bottom wall. The quantitative changes in temperature contours in different portions of the cavity are identified by comparing the results for both cases.

A finite dynamic spherical cavity-expansion approximation model with radially elastic confinement is proposed to analyze the confinement on concrete targets and predict the depth of penetration (DOP), taking steel-tube-confined concrete (STCC) targets normally penetrated by rigid projectiles as an example. Firstly, the validity of a nonlinear failure criterion to describe strength feature of concrete in the comminuted region is demonstrated by triaxial compressible tested data and the reference range of dimensionless parameter m in the modified Griffith criterion is recommended.

Experiments are performed to study the heat transfer in the cavity. Thermocouples are used to measure the temperature. In each cavity case, the temperature distribution between the vertical walls of the cavity is obtained at 35 positions in the length, seven positions in the height and one position in the depth directions. Temperature field is presented at the mid-depth of the cavity. In the central region of the cavity, the temperature is nearly constant, and the fluid is almost stagnant. Heat transfer correlation is obtained for the Rayleigh number range of 1.60 \u00d7 105 to 4.67 \u00d7 107, and the aspect ratio range of 1 to 6. The variations of the temperature profile and the local Nusselt number along the cavity height are presented.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2761506233"}}

Flow features outside the cavity demonstrated the formation and downstream movement of a \u03bb-shock due to the interaction of shock from the cavity leading edge and shock due to vortex and generation of waves on account of shear layer impingement at the cavity trailing edge. On the other hand, interesting wave structures and its propagation were monitored inside the cavity.

With the given shape of inner wall, the effect of shape regulation of the outer wavy wall was studied by a combined Finite volume method (FVM) and response surface method (RSM) method. Sinusoidal amplitude of outer wall (A) and phase deviation (\u03b3) between the inner and outer walls were found to have significant effects on surface heat transfer coefficient h. The isothermal lines deform and fluctuate much more intensively with the increase of \u03b3.

The Knudsen number is small for the gas motion in the slip-flow regime, and the temperature jump, thermal creep, frictional slip, and particularly, thermal stress slip are allowed on the solid surfaces. After solving the equations of heat conduction and fluid motion, an explicit formula for the migration velocity of the confined particle is obtained for different temperature conditions of the cavity with arbitrary values of the particle-to-cavity radius ratio and other parameters. Contributions from the thermoosmotic flow along the cavity wall and from the wall-corrected thermophoretic force to the particle velocity are equivalently important and can be linearly superimposed.

In this paper, the solidification of water near its density extremum is simulated while taking into account the expansion of the phase change material resulting from the different density of the solid and liquid phases. A thermo-mechanical coupling is achieved through one of the boundaries of the cavity behaving as an elastic wall. A methodology is introduced in which the problem is adapted in order to be solved with commercial CFD software (ANSYS Fluent 17.0). It is shown that when both the density variations and interaction of the phase change material with its boundaries are taken into account, significant differences may be observed in the flow pattern and the thermal behavior of the system, as opposed to an approach where a free ceiling or a constant density would be used. The pressure buildup inside the cavity resulting from the expansion of the phase change material as it pushes against the elastic wall causes the melting temperature to drop, which hinders solidification. It is shown that this effect becomes more pronounced as the spring constant of the elastic wall increases. It is also demonstrated that, with the assumptions made in the present model, the pressure rise may significantly influence the buoyancy forces within the cavity and change the relative size of the two counter rotating convective cells in the liquid phase. In some cases, when the pressure rises very quickly, the density extremum in the cavity disappears which strongly changes the flow pattern, i.e., only a single counter-clockwise convective cell is present in the cavity.

The jet-induced velocity fields in the axisymmetric plane are measured during both transient and steady working stages of the PSJA. When f* increases, the jet duration time (Tjet) is reduced, while the peak suction velocity (Us) increases consistently. Three integral parameters including the total expelled gas mass, impulse, and issued mechanical energy also decline considerably with increasing frequency, which is shown to relate to both the reduced cavity density and the decreasing jet duration. Theoretical analysis reveals that the mean cavity density decreases monotonically with the square root of the discharge frequency. The decreasing rate is inversely proportional to a thermal cut-off frequency ( fc, 210 Hz for the current study), which scales with the convective heat transfer coefficient between the actuator cavity walls and the cavity gas, as well as the area of the cavity internal surface.

The force fluctuations are quantified through measuring both the autocorrelation of force time series and the distributions of grain-wall forces, at distinct spatial scales from particle scale to wall scale. A key result is that the grain-wall force distributions are entirely driven by the boundary macroscopic inertial number, whatever the spatial scale considered. In particular, when the wall scale is considered, the distributions are found to evolve from nearly exponential to nearly Gaussian distributions by decreasing the macroscopic inertial number.

And indeed they do, as it was clearly demonstrated during the whole meeting with a balanced participation of dynamic and static compression contributions within the wide range of topics covered in this successful conference. The strong efforts we had invested to have with us all the potential areas touching the high-pressure field were amply compensated by the presence and high quality of scientists spanning a wide range of topics: Bio- and Life Sciences, Food Science and Technology, Metrology and Industrial Applications, Theory and Computational Modeling, Spectroscopic and Structural Studies, Condensed Matter, Geo- and Planetary Sciences, Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Materials Science and Energetic, and Materials Chemistry and Molecular Systems. By no doubt, it was demonstrated that High-Pressure is a unique \"hot\" field of research displaying both multi- and inter-disciplinary features, which makes cooperation not only a natural but also a necessary ingredient for a prosperous investigation. The \"Joint AIRAPT-25 & EHPRG-25\" conference was a faithful reflection of this scenario.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4230053756"}}

Summary This paper presents an analytical solution for cavity expansion in thermoplastic soil considering non\u2010isothermal conditions. The constitutive relationship of thermoplasticity is described by Laloui's advanced and unified constitutive model for environmental geomechanical thermal effect (ACMEG\u2010T), which is based on multi\u2010mechanism plasticity and bounding surface theory. The problem is formulated by incorporating ACMEG\u2010T into the theoretical framework of cavity expansion, yielding a series of partial differential equations (PDEs). Subsequently, the PDEs are transformed into a system of first\u2010order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using a similarity solution technique. Solutions to the response parameters of cavity expansion (stress, excess pore pressure, and displacement) can then be obtained by solving the ODEs numerically using mathematical software. The results suggest that soil temperature has a significant influence on the pressure\u2010expansion relationships and distributions of stress and excess pore pressure around the cavity wall. The proposed solution quantifies the influence of temperature on cavity expansion for the first time and provides a theoretical framework for predicting thermoplastic soil behavior around the cavity wall. The solution found in this paper can be used as a theoretical tool that can potentially be employed in geotechnical engineering problems, such as thermal cone penetration tests, and nuclear waste disposal problems.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2748045039"}}

This is the first theoretical solution of the undrained expansion of a cylindrical cavity under plane strain conditions for soft soils with anisotropic behaviour of plastic nature. The solution is rigorously developed in detail, introducing a new stress invariant to deal with the soil fabric. The semi-analytical solution requires numerical evaluation of a system of six first-order ordinary differential equations. The results agree with finite element analyses and show the influence of anisotropic plastic behaviour. The effective stresses at critical state are constant, and they may be analytically related to the undrained shear strength. The initial vertical cross-anisotropy caused by soil deposition changes towards a radial cross-anisotropy after cavity expansion. The analysis of the stress paths shows that proper modelling of anisotropic plastic behaviour involves modelling not only the initial fabric anisotropy but also its evolution with plastic straining.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2754904706"}}

The factors that influence the dynamic cavity expansion process of concrete materials were first examined. Based on numerical results, the relationship between expansion pressure and velocity was established. Then the parameters in the Forrestal's formula were fitted to have a convenient and effective prediction of the penetration depth. Results showed that both the spherical and cylindrical cavity expansion models can accurately predict the depth of penetration when the initial velocity is lower than 800 m/s. However, the prediction accuracy decreases with the increasing of the initial velocity and diameters of the projectiles.

Abstract An investigation of natural convective flow and heat transfer inside a three dimensional rectangular cavity containing an array of discrete heat sources is carried out. The array consists of a row and columnwise regular arrangement of identical square shaped isoflux discrete heaters and is flush mounted on a vertical wall of the cavity. A symmetrical isothermal sink condition is maintained by cooling the cavity uniformly from either the opposite wall or the side walls or the top and bottom walls. The other walls of the cavity are maintained adiabatic. A finite volume method based on the SIMPLE algorithm and the power law scheme is used to solve the conservation equations. The parametric study covers the influence of pertinent parameters such as the Rayleigh number, the Prandtl number, side aspect ratio of the cavity and cavity heater ratio. A detailed fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics for the three cases are reported in terms of isothermal and velocity vector plots and Nusselt numbers. In general it is found that the overall heat transfer rate within the cavity for Ra =10 7 is maximum when the side aspect ratio of the cavity lies between 1.5 and 2. A more complex and peculiar flow pattern is observed in the presence of top and bottom cold walls which in turn introduces hot spots on the adiabatic walls.

This paper examines the effect of the lattice leg on the cavities of deeply embedded spudcans in clays using centrifuge model tests and finite-element analyses. The lattice legs are characterised by two parameters, namely the opening ratio and area ratio. Both centrifuge and numerical results show that, in the presence of lattice legs, the cavities consist of two zones: a deep inner cavity within the cross-sections of the lattice legs and a much shallower outer cavity beyond the periphery of the lattice legs. The latter can be attributed to cavity wall collapse around the rim. The volume contributed by the outer cavity is much smaller than that contributed by the inner cavity. Hence, the latter is the focus of this study. The findings show that the lattice leg affects the cavity in two ways. First, it restricts soil back-flow to the region outside the lattice leg. Second, it enhances the stability of the soil on the walls of the cavity, thereby limiting the wall collapse zone to the topmost portion of the cavity. Both of these effects contribute to an increase in the cavity depth. Based on the centrifuge model test results and finite-element analyses, relations are proposed to predict the inner cavity depth which incorporates the opening and area ratios of the lattice leg, spudcan diameter and undrained shear strength of the soil. The effect of the lattice leg on bearing capacity is also illustrated using centrifuge results. Finally, the possibility of cavity wall collapse and spudcan settlement due to consolidation of soil and cyclic loading are briefly discussed using centrifuge data.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2507873277"}}

The sealing length was considered as a constant, while the cavity width, cavity depth, tooth width and pressure ratio were varied. A large number of models were calculated to study the effects of various variables on leakage of labyrinth seals. Firstly, the results show that the effects of the cavity depth on leakage could be ignored compared with that of the cavity width and sealing length. Secondly, the optimal labyrinth seals with lowest leakage can be obtained with the appropriate values of cavity widths. Furthermore, for a certain pressure ratio, the optimal cavity widths resulting in the lowest leakage were demonstrated to be stable irrespective of the values of cavity depth and sealing length.

Scattering of plane SH waves by a rectangular cavity embedded at shallow depth in an elastic half-space is investigated using a method that is a combination of the wave-function expansion and the weighed residual methods. The proposed method consists of partitioning the half-space using an auxiliary circle that encloses tightly the cavity, representing the motion in each region by a convenient expansion, and determining the coefficients of expansion by imposing continuity of stresses and displacements on the auxiliary circle, which is a transparent boundary. In the four regions inside the circle, representations are used in local coordinate systems such that satisfy automatically the zero-stress condition on the cavity walls, and in the outer region, such that satisfies the radiation condition. The coefficients of expansion are determined approximately, by projecting the displacement and stress residuals along the auxiliary circle onto a set of orthogonal weight functions on [\u2212\u03c0,\u03c0] and setting all projections simultaneously to zero in the least squares sense. The method is verified by comparison with Finite Element Method solutions obtained using ANSYS, and then used to study the effects of the model parameters, such as embedment depth, cavity aspect ratio, frequency and angle of incidence, on the ground surface and cavity wall displacements.

These high-impact-energy droplets create drop impact cavities with the longest cavity lifetimes, thinnest sub-cavity liquid films, and smallest sub-cavity liquid volumes, all of which are expected to contribute to the droplet impact cavities being both a significant source of enhanced transient local heat flux into the sub-cavity liquid volumes, as well as locations of early local surface dry out. Sub-cavity liquid film thickness is essentially constant over the inner radial portion of the cavity, but is significantly thinner at large cavity radius, somewhat inboard of the inner crown wall. The inner, constant thickness region ranges between 62% and 85% of the maximum cavity radius in extent, with an average size of 72% of maximum cavity radius. The thickness of this inner, constant thickness region ranges between 100\u00a0\u03bcm and 162\u00a0\u03bcm, with an average value of 126.5\u00a0\u03bcm, or around 4% of the nominal droplet diameter of 3\u00a0mm. This thickness varies by only around 3% of its average value for single values of the Weber number and static residual liquid layer thickness. At the end of cavity formation, the thinner regions farther outboard in the cavity are about 23% thinner than the sub-cavity film thickness in the inner region; but later, during the collapse of the crown, the thinner outboard region averages 34% less than the thickness in the inner, constant thickness region. Two major data accuracy limitations are discussed, and approximate error magnitudes are estimated. Drop-to-drop uncertainty in impact location and the uncertainty in the level of three-dimensionality of the cavity retraction process are both inherent limitations in the present liquid film thickness point-measurement method; these limitations could be avoided if a global thickness measurement over the entire cavity surface could be obtained; e.g., via stereo high-speed imaging.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2344590618"}}

The fluid is treated as a gray, absorbing, emitting and scattering medium. The governing differential equations consisting the continuity, momentum and energy are solved numerically by the computational fluid dynamics techniques to obtain the velocity and temperature fields.

Since the gas is considered as a radiating medium, besides convection and conduction, radiative heat transfer also takes place in the gas flow. For computation of the radiative term in the gas energy equation, the radiative transfer equation is solved numerically by the discrete ordinate method. The streamline and isotherm plots and the distributions of convective, radiative and total Nusselt numbers along the bottom wall of cavity are presented.

Bubble nucleation, growth and departure from a single cavity on the top of a uniformly hydrophilic heater and a uniformly hydrophobic heater at low superheats are investigated numerically based on a recently developed liquid\u2013vapor phase-change lattice Boltzmann method. A conjugate 2D heat transfer problem, including heat conduction in the heated plate with a finite thickness, is considered in this paper. It is found that bubble nucleation starts in the central part of a hydrophilic cavity and at corners of a hydrophobic cavity. In addition, the bubble departure diameter from the single cavity increases with the increase of the contact angle on a uniform wettability surface. It is also found that there is little effect on bubble behaviors if the cavity depth is small, but there is a sudden jump in bubble departure frequency from a hydrophilic cavity when the cavity depth reaches a critical value, causing the formation of a residual bubble in the hydrophilic cavity. There also exists a critical cavity width, beyond which the bubble departure diameter and bubble departure frequency increase with the increase of cavity width, and therefore enhancing boiling heat flux. The three-phase contact line region exhibits the highest local heat flux and lowest local temperature along the rough heating surface, and its location greatly affects the direction of heat transfer on the vertical side walls of the cavity. The three-phase contact line is pinned at the cavity mouth on a uniformly hydrophilic rough surface while it is expanded to outside of the cavity mouth on a uniformly hydrophobic rough surface. For a mixed wettability rough surface with a hydrophobic cavity on a hydrophilic surface, it is shown that the hydrophobic cavity promotes bubble nucleation at low wall superheats while the hydrophilic surface prevents the forward expansion of the three-phase contact line outside of the cavity mouth.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2360919211"}}

In this article, taking a cylindrical cavity subjected to constant heat flux as object, experiments were firstly performed to show the possible reason why the unsteady free convection heat transfer was not discovered in previous experimental studies. Afterwards, on the basis of three-dimensional steady and unsteady simulation models, the concept of critical cavity tilt angle was proved and its magnitude was determined. For the compromising of computation cost and accuracy, the verified steady state model was employed to analyze the effects of aperture ratio and heat flux on critical cavity tilt angle. Also the importance of selecting appropriate monitoring parameters was detailed. Results show that in general, the critical cavity tilt angle increases with decreasing aperture ratio or increasing heat flux for partially open cavities. Remarkable differences may occur among scenarios having different monitoring parameters.

This paper presents an elastic\u2013plastic semi-analytical solution for cylindrical cavity expansion in undrained soil (incompressible material) under the biaxial in situ stress condition. The soil around a cylindrical cavity is assumed to behave as elastic\u2013plastic perfectly plastic material, as characterised by Tresca yield strength with the associated flow rule. Based on Galin's solution, the stress and the elastic\u2013plastic boundary around the cylindrical cavity can be determined using the conformal mapping technique and complex variable theory. Then, by considering incompressible and small strain\u2013displacement conditions, the problem of kinematics is reduced to solving a system of the second-order ordinary differential equations, which results in the general solution for the radial and circumferential displacements in the plastic zone around the cylindrical cavity. Subsequently, the constant coefficients of the general solution can be determined by the displacement continuity condition at the elastic\u2013plastic boundary using the least-squares method. The new elastic\u2013plastic analytical solution presented in this paper extends Galin's solution, particularly by giving a closed-form equation for the kinematics around the cylindrical cavity, which could reflect the \u2018non-circular effect\u2019 of the cylindrical cavity during the expansion in a biaxial in situ stress field.

In both cases a large counter-rotating vortex pair was observed inside the cavity, and the unsteady shear layer over the open section of the cavity produces regular vortex shedding.

The coupled natural convection-radiation heat transfer across cavities is an extremely important research issue commonly encountered in many innovative building envelope applications. Extensive both experimental and numerical studies were conducted to analyse the natural convection flow coupled with radiation heat transfer across vertical and inclined rectangular cavities, proposing accurate empirical or regression correlations according to the particularities of the studied cavity problem. Nevertheless, there is a lack of correlations accurate and adapted enough to model coupled natural convection-radiation across cavities in the vicinity of low emissivity surfaces. The present work aims to cover this subject, through an exhaustive numerical analysis validated and evaluated enough with the use of experimental data. A numerical model is firstly updated to simulate infrared radiation and convective heat transfer across a sophisticated innovative building envelope prototype, while 8 different approximations have been implemented in the model in order to evaluate a variety of available correlations on the subject. Formerly the numerical approach presented here used available experimental data for the same prototype. The air\u2019s temperature experimental data served as input to the model boundaries in order to exactly impose the same initial conditions for obtaining the results. Furthermore, experimental data regarding the temperature on the sample\u2019s interfaces were used for validating the proposed theoretical model. Satisfactory enough agreements are observed between the theoretically simulated and experimentally measured temperatures and the model is afterwards evaluated to determine the most accurate approximation. Finally, the numerical study presented in this paper concluded in the proposition of 2 new updated correlations to model natural convection across vertical cavities in the vicinity of low emissivity surfaces with the perspective to further support their implementation into Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) codes.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2310680427"}}

These changes can increase heat transfer from cold wall between 13% and 40% for different boundary conditions. If hot and cold walls are near together, millimeter changes are enough for acceptable percent value of increase of heat transfer, but for cases that hot wall is far from cold wall, we must attach medium or large blocks on hot wall or construct new cavities in accordance with optimized shape obtained from PSO algorithm.

Recirculation accompanied by shear cavitation is a key flow feature in annular jet pumps (AJPs). In this study, a high-speed camera was used to capture the recirculation region and various types of cavity clouds. By monitoring the trajectories of the small bubbles, the main recirculation regions under each flow rate ratio were obtained. As the flow rate ratio decreases, the recirculation region continued expanding with the separation point moving upstream, while the reattachment point remained nearly stationary regardless of the decreasing flow rate ratio. Hill's spherical vortex theory was adopted to evaluate the variations of the recirculation regions. Moreover, the minimum local static wall pressure in the recirculation region decreases as well, which can promote the inception and development of shear cavitation. There are numerous vortices simultaneously induced by the large velocity gradient in the shear layer, the core of which becomes a potential site for cavitation. Consequently, with the growth of the recirculation region, three types of cavity clouds, viz., the ribbonlike, annular, and merged cavity clouds, appear in turn. The movement characteristics of these cavity clouds, including their inception, distortion, and collapse, are illustrated based on the high-speed imaging results. The ribbonlike and annular cavity clouds are both induced by the small vortices in the shear layer because of the low local pressure in the vortex core. However, the merged cavity clouds are caused by a combination of several ribbonlike and annular cavity clouds, which provides a larger scale and a longer life span. Hence, the collapse of the merged cavity clouds can cause a large pressure pulsation near the reattachment point of the recirculation region.

The present study aims to address the effect of sphere temperature on water-entry cavity. For this purpose, an experiment on vertical water-entry cavity of a heated sphere is conducted by utilizing a high-speed video camera. The temperature of the sphere ranges from 17\u2103 to 800\u2103. The complex flow phenomena of water entry, produced by a change in temperature of a sphere, is obtained for the first time. According to the finding, cavity is not formed around the room temperature sphere under the condition of the impact velocity of 1.5 m/s. When the temperature of the sphere is 300\u2103, the cavity appears, while it disappears when the temperature reaches up to 400\u2103. Interestingly, cavity appears again as the sphere is heated to a temperature of 700\u2103. The degrees of drag reduction of the sphere are different in various temperature conditions. Based on the theory of heat transfer and fluid dynamics, we analyze the mechanism for the influences of temperature and velocity on the forming of cavitation. The results show that the heat-transfer efficiency and heat-transfer mode between sphere and water change with the increase of temperature. Meanwhile the turbulent characteristic around the sphere, the surface roughness and hydrophobicity of the sphere are affected by the bubbles and vapor layer. In consequence, these characteristics influence the formation of cavity. The results of the effect of impact velocity on water-entry cavity reveal that the heat transfer performance plays a significant role in the forming of cavity, while the heat transfer efficiency is improved by the increase of impact velocity. The water-entry characteristics are similar to those in flow field under high temperature at low impact velocity as well as under low temperature at high impact velocity. The flow field of water entry looks similar under 330\u2103 at high impact velocity as well as under 400\u2103 at low impact velocity. Thus, an abnormal phenomenon appears. That is to say, the cavity size first decreases, and then disappears with the increase of impact velocity for the sphere at 330\u2103. The heat transfer performance can determine whether a cavity forms under the conditions of the impact velocity ranging from 1.5 m/s to 3.8 m/s. Meanwhile, the impact velocity itself can merely affect the cavity shape.

However, given high Rayleigh numbers, the effect of inclination angle on heat function contours and Nusselt number is significant.

Original Research Paper Received 02 February 2016 Accepted 09 March 2016 Available Online 16 May 2016 Cavity length estimation is important as supercavity condition is generated. The natural cavity length is function of cavity number and is calculated by relations deduced from experimental results which are different from each other and are not driven from analytical approaches. Literature survey shows that correlations based on cavity length in relation with Reynolds and cavity numbers have not been attempted. The purpose of the present work is to estimate analytical based relations for cavity length with respect to mass transfer, continuity and momentum conservation equations. This attempt, which was conducted by order of magnitude method resulted in three relations. The first analytical based relation calculates cavity length versus cavity number. The obtained relation shows that cavity length is proportional to the inverse square root of cavity number. The second analytical relation calculates cavity length with respect to Reynolds number. It shows cavity length has a proportional relation to Reynolds square root. The third analytical relation considers cavity number with respect to Reynolds number. The third relation shows that cavity number has inverse relation to Reynolds number. Unknown coefficients values of the relations are obtained through comparison with the already existed experimental results. These analytical relations which are an appropriate alternative to experimental based relations estimate cavity length with respect to cavity and Reynolds number.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2518397292"}}

This study investigates cavity flows through a guide grill above a resonator. Vortex distributions and intake flows are simulated for various shapes of the guide grill. The flows are assumed to be compressible, unsteady, and turbulent. Numerical simulations are conducted using a large eddy simulation (LES) model. To analyze the effect of the guide grill shape, three cavity lengths (0.2H, 0.6H, and 1.0H) and cavity angles (30\u00b0, 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0) are considered based on resonator height (H). The results show that the vortex generated in the resonator by cavity flow increases with cavity length. Thus, the intake flow is minimum at the smallest cavity length and angle. However, when cavity length is equal to resonator height, the intake flow decreases. The maximum intake flow occurs at a cavity angle 45\u00b0 at higher cavity lengths owing to the interaction between the vortex in the resonator and intake flow.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2359025230"}}

Unsteady pressure measurement and schlieren flow visualization is employed to gain insight into the flow physics. Schlieren visualization revealed shock train like pattern for the cavities without offset. These shock structures are unsteady and oscillated longitudinally inside the test section over the cavity. The shock pattern disappeared as the blockage produced due to cavity pressure rise and shear layer oscillation is minimized by offsetting the cavity aft wall. Experimental investigations confirmed that the size of the cavity relative to the test section could have significant effect on the nature of flow field over the cavity and also on the acoustic oscillations within the cavity. For 90\u00b0 ramp angle the dominant mode frequency in pressure oscillations shifted from second to third mode as the cavity aft wall is offset; however the shift in dominant mode frequency is not observed for the 60\u00b0 cavity with aft wall offset.

Experimental study was conducted to investigate the effect of orifice cavity shape on resonance frequency and heat transfer characteristics of synthetic jets. The main purpose of the study is to characterise the effect of orifice cavity shapes at small jet-to-surface spacings. The velocity measurement results show that the resonance frequency is a weak function of cavity volume as the resonance frequency remains same for all the cavity shapes considered in the present study. It is noticed that approximately the same pressure is generated inside different orifice cavities at a given radial location of the orifice cavity. The results of heat transfer experiments reveal that the orifice cavity confinement plays a major role at smaller jet-to-surface spacings. The heat transfer enhancement at lower jet-to-surface spacings for orifice cavity with least confinement is three times higher as compared with that of orifice cavity with maximum confinement. At higher jet-to-surface spacings, the confinement effect is negligible and maximum heat transfer enhancement is obtained for all the orifice cavities irrespective of their shape. The application of optimum orifice cavity shape can overcome the limitation of degradation of performance of synthetic jet at lower jet-to-surface spacings. The results of the present study are important as it identifies the region (z/d < 2) within which the orifice cavity shape plays key role in improving the heat transfer enhancement with synthetic jets. In this region cavity air temperature is more relevant from design point of view. Beyond z/d > 2, the effect of orifice cavity shape is negligible.

To understand and mitigate these cavity\u2013tunnel interactions, a parametric approach was taken for flow over an L/D = 7 cavity at Mach numbers 0.6\u20130.8.

An acoustic liner opposite the cavity decreased the amplitude of the dominant mode and its harmonics, a result observed by previous researchers. Acoustic dampeners were also placed in the tunnel sidewalls, which further decreased the dominant mode amplitudes and peak amplitudes associated with nonlinear interactions between cavity modes. This indicates that cavity resonance can be altered by tunnel sidewalls and that spanwise coupling should be addressed when conducting subsonic cavity experiments.

Flow through tip shroud cavity in a representative axial turbine vane-rotor stage environment is assessed for its role in loss generation and turbine durability. Steady and unsteady three-dimensional flow computations, complemented by control volume analyses, for varying shroud configurations provided results for establishing quantitative links between loss and ow processes as well as loss level scalings. Specifically tip shroud cavity flow is dominated by two counter-rotating vortices upstream, and a free expansion leakage jet downstream, of the tip seal, followed by a mixing shear layer at cavity exit. One of the vortices, the cavity inlet toroidal vortex, sets the loss level within the cavity inlet and the mass ow recirculated out of the cavity into the main flow path. It is found that tip shroud cavity flow incurs a 0:85% debit in stage eciency per 1% of main flow fluid through the cavity with approximately 50% generated in the free expansion of the tip seal leakage jet and 50% from cavity exit mixing. The proportion of total loss attributable to cavity exit mixing increases with tip seal gap. In addition, vane-rotor unsteady interaction induces an additional 0:25% debit in eciency per 1% of main flow fluid through the cavity. The additional efficiency penalty induced by vane-rotor unsteady interaction results from an enhancement of the cavity inlet toroidal vortex and associated recirculated mass flow. Overall cavity loss is set by cavity mass flow fraction, stagnation pressure ratio across tip seal, velocity disparity between cavity exit flow and rotor exit flow, and cavity inlet vortex strength. These findings were used to formulate a modified tip shroud configuration that nearly eliminates cavity exit mixing loss, but it incurs a penalty associated with cavity flow low Reynolds number effects and induced mismatching between vane and modified tip shroud. In the process of designing this modified tip shroud, it was found that the turbine main flow perceives the cavity as a line sink-source pair, permitting estimation of flow redistribution in the main flow path. Finally, any operational transients which eliminate tip seal clearance would lead to enhanced impingement heat transfer at blade tip due to recirculating ow from cavity inlet; this can increase the likelihood of blade failure.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W936524509"}}

The macroscale movement behaviour of a wide range of isolated migrating cells has been well characterised experimentally. Recently, attention has turned to understanding the behaviour of cells in crowded environments. In such scenarios it is possible for cells to interact mechanistically, inducing neighbouring cells to move in order to make room for their own movements or progeny. Although the behaviour of interacting cells has been modelled extensively through volume-exclusion processes, no models, thus far, have explicitly accounted for the ability of cells to actively displace each other. In this work we consider both on and off-lattice volume-exclusion position-jump processes in which cells are explicitly allowed to induce movements in their near neighbours in order to create space for themselves (which we refer to as pushing). From these simple individual-level representations we derive continuum partial differential equations for the average occupancy of the domain. We find that, for limited amounts of pushing, the comparison between the averaged individual-level simulations and the population-level model is nearly as good as in the scenario without pushing but, that for larger and more complicated pushing events the assumptions used to derive the population-level model begin to break down. Interestingly, we find that, in the on-lattice case, the diffusion coefficient of the population-level model is increased by pushing, whereas, for the particular off-lattice model that we investigate, the diffusion coefficient is reduced. We conclude therefore, that it is important to consider carefully the appropriate individual-level model to use when representing complex cell-cell interactions such as pushing.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1861771558"}}

The study is aimed to investigate the mixed convective transport within a ventilated square cavity in presence of a heat conducting circular cylinder. The fluid flow is imposed through an opening at the bottom of the left cavity wall and is taken away by a similar opening at the top of the right cavity wall. The cylinder is placed at the center of the cavity. Two cases are considered depending on the thermal conditions of the cavity walls. In the first case, the left and right vertical walls are kept isothermal with different temperatures and the top and bottom horizontal walls are considered as thermally insulated. For the second case, the top and bottom walls are maintained at different constant temperatures and the left and right walls are considered adiabatic.

A finite-width rectangular cavity was found to encourage downwash into the cavity, and a pair of counter-rotating longitudinal vortices was established in the wake region of the cavity. The downwash draws high-speed boundary-layer flow into the cavity and augments the heating on the cavity floor. The high-speed flow impinges on the cavity endwall and causes local peak heating.

The conventional cavity expansion method is based on the assumption of uniform radial pressure applied at the cavity wall boundary without considering the shear stress. However, in practice, shear stress may exist at the cavity wall, such as during the drilling process of drilled displacement piles. This note presents an analysis of the influence of shear stress on cylindrical cavity expansion in an undrained elastic\u2013perfectly plastic soil. The problem is formulated by assuming large strain in the plastic zone and small strain in the elastic zone around the cavity, with a plane-strain condition under the cavity expansion process. Plastic yielding is determined by the Tresca failure criterion and an associated flow rule. A closed-form solution for the pressure\u2013expansion relation is given to modify the conventional pressure\u2013expansion relation without considering the influence of the shear stress. The plastic zone radius, cavity wall limit pressure, stress and excess pore pressure are also obtained. Furthermore, parametric studies are carried out to investigate the influence of shear stress on the cavity wall limit pressure, stress, excess pores pressure distributions around an expanding cylindrical cavity and the plastic zone radius. The results show that shear stress at the cavity wall boundary has a significant influence on the pressure\u2013expansion relation and cannot be neglected when deriving the cavity wall pressure or excess pore pressure.

Hence the tin cavity underneath or the nitrogen cavity above is being driven by a variable speed. Another application involves casting of plastic films. The molten polymer leaves the die with a considerable thickness and high temperature. The film is then trenched to reach its final thickness. In this case, usually there is no actual cavity above or below the film but one can approximate the problem as such. Other similar applications do exist in food drying and processing where the conveyer belt is in portions and their speed may not be the same in different section of the processing oven.

The dynamics of a light sphere in a quickly rotating inclined cylinder filled with liquid under transversal vibrations is experimentally investigated. Due to inertial oscillations of the sphere relative to the cavity, its rotation velocity differs from the cavity one. The intensification of the lagging motion of a sphere and the excitation of the outstripping differential rotation are possible under vibrations. It occurs in the resonant areas where the frequency of vibrations coincides with the fundamental frequency of the system. The position of the sphere in the center of the cylinder could be unstable. Different velocities of the sphere are matched with its various quasistationary positions on the axis of rotating cavity. In tilted rotating cylinder, the axial component of the gravity force appears; however, the light sphere does not float to the upper end wall but gets the stable position at a definite distance from it.

Ideal cavities face a high risk of erosion in relation to pneumatic conveying. To reduce erosion, we introduce a height difference in the cavity, with the leading wall higher than the aft wall. To improve the cavity structure, the URANS (SST)-DPM method is adopted to study the effect of height difference h on gas flow, particle distribution, and particle erosion of a horizontal ideal cavity. The simulation procedure is validated by comparing the computational fluid dynamics results with experimental results. The results of the gas flow modeling show that the shear layer impinges on the aft wall when h is relatively small, and re-attaches on the downstream bottom wall as h increases. The re-attachment length is initially identical to the cavity width, then increases uniformly with h. Results of the particle distribution simulations indicate that for a Stokes number (St) of 0.12, the particles are evenly distributed in the cavity, and the distribution is independent of h; for St = 1.2, dominated by the centrifugal force, the particles are mainly concentrated along the periphery of the main vortex when h is small. Owing to the variation of the main vortex, as h increases, more particles will fall down into the main vortex. For St = 9.1, where gravity is dominant, the particles collide on the aft wall and rebound into the cavity through the main vortex when h is small. Otherwise, particles will move forward and only a few particles appear in the cavity. We explored the erosion distribution on the downstream bottom walls and extracted and analyzed the initial erosion positions.

A new method is developed for the prediction of cavity on two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) hydrofoils by a potential-based Boundary Element Method (BEM). In the case of specified cavitation number and cavity length, the iterative solution method proceeds by addition or subtraction of a displacement thickness on the cavity surface of the hydrofoil. The appropriate cavity shape is obtained by the dynamic boundary condition on the cavity surface and the kinematic boundary condition on the whole foil surface including the cavity. For a given cavitation number the cavity length of 2D hydrofoil is determined according to the minimum error criterion among different cavity lengths. In the 3D case, the prediction of cavity is exactly the same as in the case of 2D method in span wise locations by the transformation of the pressure distribution from analysis of 3D to 2D. The 3D effects at each span-wise location are considered by the multiplication of the cavitation number by a coefficient. The pressure recovery and termination wall models are used as cavity termination. For the 2D case the NACA 16006 and NACA 16012 hydrofoil sections are investigated for two angles of attack using different cavity termination models.

By fixing the number of large particles, the level of crowding is adjusted by changing the amount of small hard spheres in the cavity. For a rigid cavity, large spheres tend to pack in liquid-like order apart from the surface to the center of the cavity as the crowding level is increased. Whereas, for a soft cavity, larger spheres tend to blend with small spheres in the peripheral region at near the boundary of the cavity, and are susceptible to be depleted from the interior of the cavity as the cavity becomes more crowded.

This paper presents an analytical solution for undrained elasto-plastic cylindrical cavity expansion in saturated soil under anisotropic initial stress. The problem is formulated by assuming small-strain deformation in the elastic zone and large-strain deformation in the plastic zone. Plastic yielding is determined by the Tresca failure criterion and an associated flow rule. Two stress functions are used to describe the stress state in the two zones around the cavity. The elasto-plastic boundary can subsequently be determined by solving the two stress functions under the stress boundary conditions. Additionally, the cavity pressure-expansion relationship, the total stress and the excess pore pressure around the cavity wall under anisotropic initial stress can be easily obtained by application of a numerical integration. The results show that the cavity pressure and excess pore pressure under the isotropic initial total stress (K = 1) are larger than those under the anisotropic initial stress (K > 1 and K < 1), which is true at all states of the expansion. The higher value of K develops lower stress and pore pressure around the cavity wall at the ultimate states. However, the stress and excess pore pressure are not sensitive to the value of K.

The store responded to the cavity flow at its natural structural frequencies, as previously determined with modal hammer tests, and it exhibited a directional dependence to cavity resonance. Specifically, cavity tones excited the store in the streamwise and wall-normal directions consistently, while a spanwise response was observed only occasionally. The streamwise and wall-normal responses were attributed to the known pressure gradients in these directions. Furthermore, spanwise vibrations were greater at the downstream end of the cavity, attributable to decreased levels of flow coherence near the aftwall.

The equations of motion, written in nondimensional form, depending on five nondimensional parameters (the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers, the ratio of the thermal conductivities and diffusivities of the fluid, the material of the cavity, and the nondimensional width of the walls), are solved numerically by the use of the SIMPLE algorithm. Three different heat transfer regimes were detected. The first one is the diffusive and quasi-diffusive, where heat is rapidly transferred along the cavity walls and then transmitted to the fluid from the internal boundary of the cavity, being almost independent on the Rayleigh number with a symmetrical response of the temperature and velocity fields. The second is diffusive-convective, where convection plays a more important role than in the previous case, symmetry is no longer preserved and different mechanisms of symmetry breakdown are present. The third one is the convective regime, where heat conduction along the walls is negligible and they can be assumed to be perfect insulators.

For the motions of a slip particle in a concentric slip cavity and near a no-slip cavity wall with a small curvature, our results are in good agreement with the available solutions in the literature.

The problem was numerically modeled with a commercial CFD code, FLUENT v 6.2.16. To circumvent the need for a moving mesh, a reference frame attached to the wall was used. For numerical uncertainty estimation, the Grid Convergence Index (GCI) method was used for both temporal and spatial resolutions at a Reynolds Number (based on the cavity height) of 200. The spatial grid resolution study was done at different time-steps (in the oscillation cycle) on the cross-streamwise velocity on a plane connecting the two open edges of the cavity (lip of the cavity).

The cavity inflow is generated by means of synthetic stochastic time-dependent methods in a precursor simulation, in order to identify and analyze quantitatively the streaks in the spatially developing boundary layer approaching the cavity. In the cavity flow model, no self-sustained oscillation is found, due to the high value of the boundary layer thickness. The influence of the approaching boundary layer turbulent scales on the cavity instabilities is examined. The intermittent cavity flow behaviour is related to the injection and ejection of vortex structures across the cavity opening and downstream edge. The space and time resolution of the LES enables to identify the flow dynamics of vortical instabilities and of the three-dimensional structures in the cavity shear layer. Cavity noise sources are identified by correlation and spectral analysis. In the upstream region of the cavity, the streaks break down into smaller and less coherent structures, as shown by the reduction of the integral length scale. In the rearmost region of the cavity, a spanwise negative velocity correlation is interpreted as a dipole-type noise source, which is likely to reduce the radiated noise level with respect to a two-dimensional cavity flow.

On the other hand, heatlines are horizontally stretched at core of the cavity for higher Pr (Pr=0.7 and 1000) at K=10. End to end heatlines are highly compressed near top portion of the cavity at K=10 irrespective of Pr. Closed loop heatlines are absent for case 2 at Ra=103 whereas closed loop heatlines with lesser magnitude than cases 1 and 3 are observed for case 2 at Ra=105 due to less heat transfer from the hot solid wall irrespective of Pr at K=0.1 and 1. The heat transfer rate can be maintained constant at low thermal conductivity ratio (K) even for the high convective regime (Ra=105) irrespective of wall thickness (t1 and t2). Average Nusselt number shows overall larger heat transfer rate for higher K (K=10), which is almost identical with classical natural convection (zero wall thickness) compared to lower K (K=0.1 and 1) irrespective of location of wall thickness (cases 1\u20133). In order to achieve almost invariant or lower fluid temperature at Ra=105 for t1+t2=0.2 and 0.8, solid wall at hot side (case 2) may be useful. This heating strategy may be viewed for high temperature shielding or minimization of thermal runaway for temperature sensitive applications, such as environmental control system, chemical storage reservoirs, etc., where heat flow is controlled by solid wall resistance.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2083591843"}}

An accurate molecular dynamics simulation of the nanocavity flow cannot be achieved without considering correct thermal treatments for the molecules both distributed in the flow and located at the cavity walls and without including their interactions correctly. In this study, we specify constant temperature at the nanocavity vertical walls; however, we examine three different thermal wall models, including a rigid wall, a controlled-temperature flexible wall, and a noncontrolled-temperature flexible wall, to model the horizontal wall behaviors. Comparing the results of these three models with each other, it is possible to evaluate the effect of wall model on the resulting temperature and velocity field behaviors. The results indicate that the velocity field is not affected that much using these three different wall models; however, they predict different temperature fields.

Abstract An analytical solution for the low-Reynolds-number flow field of a shear flow over a rectangular cavity containing a second immiscible fluid is derived. While flow of a single-phase fluid over a cavity is a standard case investigated in fluid dynamics, flow over a cavity that is filled with a second immiscible fluid has received little attention. The flow field inside the cavity is considered to define a boundary condition for the outer flow, which takes the form of a Navier slip condition with locally varying slip length. The slip-length function is determined heuristically from the related problem of lid-driven cavity flow. Based on the Stokes equations and complex analysis, it is then possible to derive a closed analytical expression for the flow field over the cavity for both the transverse and the longitudinal case. The result is a comparatively simple function, which displays the dependence of the flow field on the cavity geometry and the medium filling the cavity. The analytically computed expression agrees well with results obtained from a numerical solution of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3103206847"}}

The model is further transformed into the drag force in terms of penetration velocity based on experimentally observed maximum cavity radii and the separation angles of gelatin from spheres. The key parameter is the work needed to open unit volume of cavity in gelatin, which is found to be linearly increasing with the characteristic strain-rate, defined by the characteristic velocity over the cavity's local maximum radius. The model's predictability for drag forces is well confirmed by penetration experiments using steel-spheres of four sizes and one tungsten-sphere.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2051215113"}}

The thermally active elements are centrally located on the walls of the cavity. Two heating modes are considered: in the first mode, named VB heating mode, the cavity is heated discreetly on the left vertical and bottom horizontal walls, while in the second mode, named VT heating mode, the left vertical and top horizontal walls of the cavity are heated. The remaining portions of the walls, other than those cooled, are considered adiabatic. The parameters governing the problem are the emissivity of the walls (0 \u2264 \u03f5 \u2264 1), the relative lengths of the active elements (), and the Rayleigh number (104 \u2264 Ra \u2264 107).

This study focuses on the forces experienced by the sphere in both cavity-forming and non-cavity-forming cases. Unsteady force estimates require accurate determination of the deceleration for both high and low mass ratios, especially as inertial and hydrodynamic effects approach equality. Using high-speed imaging, high-speed particle image velocimetry, and numerical simulation, we examine the nature of the forces in each case. The effect of mass ratio is shown, where a lighter sphere undergoes larger decelerations and more dramatic trajectory changes. In the non-cavity-forming cases, the forces are modulated by the growth and shedding of a strong, ring-like vortex structure. In the cavity-forming cases, little vorticity is shed by the sphere, and the forces are modulated by the unsteady pressure required for the opening and closing of the air cavity.

The cavities are characterized by azimuthal harmonic disturbances with a single mode number $m$ and amplitude $a_m$. For small initial distortion amplitude (1 or 2% of the mean disc radius), the cavity walls oscillate linearly during collapse, with nearly constant amplitude and increasing frequency. As the amplitude is increased, higher harmonics are triggered in the oscillations and we observe more complex pinch-off modes.

In the world of industry, insulation materials are often utilized to maintain the temperature, either low or high. However, since the insulation materials often need to be thick, thus, costly, they are frequently deemed impractical. Therefore, in the attempt to replace the insulation materials, a cavity with low vacuum pressure is opted for. Yet, to attain a total (100%) airfree cavity is not an easy task. Such, the cavity usually still bears some amount of air pressure which results in natural heat convection through the two surfaces making up the cavity. The transfer coefficient of natural heat convection (h) is influenced by some factors, such as, the temperature difference, geometry of the cavity, cavity orientation, and characteristics of the fluid, for instance, its pressure, temperature, conductivity, specific gravity (density), and viscosity.

A numerical investigation is presented for fluid flow and heat transfer of an electrically conductive liquid in a square cavity. In this work, the right wall of the cavity is kept at a high constant temperature, and the others are at low uniform temperature. The cool walls and the fluid are heated by both convection and radiation. The motion of the fluid is described by continuity equation and momentum equation which are solved by artificial compressibility algorithm based on finite volume method (FVM). The heat transfer of the fluid along with the walls is described by energy equation and radiative transfer equation (RTE) which are solved by FVM and discrete ordinates method (DOM) respectively. New dimensionless number A and B are obtained by dimensional analysis of governing equations. Investigations are performed with different A number and Ha number. The results show that radiation has remarkable effects on fluid flow and heat transfer under different values of parameters.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2009705014"}}

Numerical solution of 2-D polar cavity is very less investigated analytically, numerically and experimentally. The investigation is mainly to understand the flow phenomena in the domain. One of the difficulties that occur for the numerical investigation is domain setup for complex geometry. The numerical solution for polar cavity is made possible by ANSYS FLUENT. Steady state incompressible ideal gas is considered for simplicity and other mechanical and thermal properties of fluid are constant with respect to temperature and pressure. The cavity\u2019s stationary walls such as inner radial wall and side wall kept as isothermal wall, while outer radial wall is set in motion in circumferential direction. The physical characteristic of flow phenomena in the polar cavity is analysed for different Reynolds numbers and different angles (300, 600 and 900). Based on the mean velocity results, convective heat transfer coefficient in the driven curve cavity is computed. At end of the study, it is expected the convective coefficient increases with respect to the Reynolds numbers and cavity angle. The results are verified based on the numerical solution found in the in the published literature.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W168569701"}}

In this experiment, the effects of the combination of jets or rods and a porous cavity on the supersonic flow field are studied by means of visualization of schlieren method and the measurements of wall static pressures and the flow direction in the cavity with the thermal tuft probe. Three cases of jets or rods arrangements are tested in the experiments. As a result, a bow shock wave which is generated by the jets or rods is observed by mean of schlieren method. And it is confirmed that the expansion region appears downstream of the rods but is not in case of the jets pattern. Moreover the pressure ratios of starting shock wave passing through porous cavity for jets pattern differ from that of rods pattern. In the cavity, the flow direction at the measurement position in the cavity is always opposite to the main flow, as long as the starting shock wave is located upstream of the porous cavity for all cases. Difference in the backward flow ratio between the jets and rods patterns is observe after the starting shock wave passes through the porous cavity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2019827130"}}
