This purpose of this study is to identify how the expressions of tradition can be reinterpreted into modern architectures expecially through large scale government office buildings by analyzing existing design examples. Comparing to expression of tradition by metaphorical interpretation that is considered as a creative and subjective area, eidetic expression of tradition, limitations are bound to follow to interpretate the traditional architecture principle into modern space through bringing concept of reinterpretation and reinvention. Several cases of large scale governmental Buildings are analyzed in terms of the expression of architectural eidetic elements and architectural content elements.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2245041314"}}

The study intends to understand how the various types of unit organization generate different spatial properties in the apartments. For the purpose, various types of apartments are analyzed based on the theory of Space Syntax. In the early stage of Korea, the stair-type and corridor-type of unit organization had appeared more frequently. As the quantity of the apartments became more enlarged, however, the stair-type appeared more dominant due to the general belief that it can provide the living unit more privacy and more living area. On the other hand, the corridor-type have been used more sparsely. More recently, the corridor-type is applied mainly to the apartments consisting of relatively small size living units or the rental based public apartments only. This study has analyzed the spatial properties of some apartments by using the convex analysis method. The analysis of domestic apartments shows that the common spaces of the stair-type apartments are more segregated than those of the corridor-type apartments. By contrast, the selected apartments of other countries designed by architects show various utilization of the common spaces by using diverse interpretations of the relationship between the living units and the common spaces. If the apartments has a chance to employ more diversified interpretation of the unit organization, the study suggest, the apartments can provide the users more profound understanding of the sense of community.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2257704105"}}

This research purposes to understand architectural aim which the owners of buildings in the Doa-Rak-Dang block pursue through the history of family and construction. Moreover its other purpose is to find the design concepts which were selected to achieve the aim and the design elements which were applied to realize the design concepts. To accomplish the objects, it got rid of a stationary viewpoint but it approached with a dynamic viewpoint which can read the changes in the steps during various periods. Through the 100-year history of construction, the architectural aim of the Doa-Rak-Dang block is to establish the tradition of the Ok-San-Pa family to get over the social limitations of the family of a child by a concubine which began from Lee, Eun-Juk's mistress. The design concepts which were used by the owners of the Dok-Rak-Dang block to achieve the purpose are the extension of public territory and the enrichment of territoriality which have social-political, economical and symbolic means. The geometric applications such as axises and regulating lines were the design elements which were chosen to fulfill the concepts. If the establishment of the architectural aim and design concepts, the process of selecting and constructing proper design elements, and the geometric application in the process are the design principles of the Doa-Rak-Dang block, the principles can be summarized as the geometric applications of axises and regulating lines interacting as the standard of the extension of public area.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2368962865"}}

Nowadays, much local knowledge about South Sumatran traditional architecture is gradually disappearing because of the way of thinking and cultural changes in society. The introduction of new technology and building materials in the housing construction industry has made it possible for problems to be solved almost instantly. As a result, there has been a tendency to discard the traditional construction techniques that have been in use for centuries.. However, for generations, local communities have used such traditional indigenous building construction technology in traditional houses that were adapted to Nature and have withstood natural disasters. It would be an enormous lost for the community and country if such traditional skills, .expertise and problem solving strategies inherent in indigenous building construction were to be discarded and be lost forever.  The objective of this research is to show that there can be many aspects of building construction that can be learned and developed from the indigenous technology of South Sumatran traditional architecture for sustainable housing construction This research uses a qualitative approach for its data collection through multiple-case study. The three strategies of analysis implemented in this research emphasise more description, comparison, and evaluation. The method used in this study comprised interviews, observation and visual documentation. Objects under study amounted to 13 traditional houses located in two cities and four regencies in a province of South Sumatra. Traditional houses were chosen based on previous research, information and field work. In addition, the determination of a traditional house is based on its geographical location and architectural style. The 29 respondents comprised owners or occupants of the houses studied, local leaders, community leaders, local builders and experts.  Indigenous technology shows how site selection, house layout, structure and local materials of traditional houses have the ability to be environmentally friendly and able to withstand natural disasters for generations. Traditional houses are also very durable in the face of natural disasters such as landslides, floods and earthquakes.  Proper understanding and interpretation of indigenous technology of traditional architecture that adapts to the environment can provide better housing solutions. Indigenous technology of South Sumatra\u2019s traditional architecture can be interpreted as a concept for sustainable housing construction that is imbued with a sense of aesthetics, is environmentally friendly, utilizes logical technology, and in line with cultural and economic needs.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2560440474"}}

While a vast number of cad drawings are produced in the life cycle of construction projects from the planning, design, and construction phases to the maintenance and control phases, the creation and distribution of non-standard drawings make it difficult for the construction parties to communicate with one another and to recycle, maintain, and control drawings by project phase. The Korea standard of CAD drawing in construction CALS/EC, which stipulates the standard for construction CAD drawings, is based on roads, rivers, and railways in line- and unit-based structures, allowing the creation of standardized CAD drawings. Such standard, however, cannot be easily applied to construction projects with multiple facilities like harbors, housing sites, or lands consisting of surface forms. In particular, port field consist of complex docks and amenities located in a certain coastal area based on multiple objectives. They also contain the concept of housing sites, like background land, and are composed of various civil engineering facilities, construction facilities, and port field, so that the existing CAD drawing standard cannot be easily implemented. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to maximize the efficiency of the information related to drawing information and to ultimately support smooth information exchanges in construction design by conducting a development research on the expansion of the CAD drawing standard that meets the needs of port field.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1983259075"}}

The languages are spoken by the people of insular southeast Asia, Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia in the Pacific, as well as certain parts of the Asia mainland. The vernacular architecture of the people that belong to this language family shows certain shared characteristics that seem to indicate a common origin in the distant past. The Grand Shrines at Ise, Japan pose an intriguing phenomenon because they possess striking architectural features that are reminiscent of Austronesian vernacular architecture. This paper is an attempt to investigate the phenomenon using the findings of studies by experts from other disciplines such as historians, anthropologists, linguists and others, based on the link between culture, language and architecture. 1", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2138409225"}}

An Example of Urban Regeneration", "abstract": "The Memorial Museum of Jewish Culture in Prague. An Example of Urban Regeneration. The theme of this paper regards the results of the main research activities carried out in the Architectural Design Laboratory. The last years of the Laboratory were dedicated to set up a research on a specific case study. The project site is the Old Town of Prague, the ancient Jewish Quarter called Josefov Ghetto with the cemetery and the synagogues and Kl\u00e1\u0161ter sv. Ane\u017eky \u010cesk\u00e9 (the Convent with cloister and Church of St. Agnes of Bohemia). The project was supported by a series of analysis and investigation of cartographic, iconographic, and bibliography materials, which allowed us to investigate aspects regarding the urban history, the city and the particular context of application. This exploration about the context is compared to the potential of the place, the physical characteristics, the settlement structure's and the aesthetic characters. The analysis was related by different phases. The first phase involved a site inspection of the area for observing the main architectural buildings. This work was necessary for surveying properly the site and for investigating the current situation of the area. A second step was reserved for processing drawings, maps and three-dimensional models, which allowed us to reconstruct the context and the existing buildings. Finally, this process involved the architectural definition of the project, which integrated strategic choices of new settlement with the structural analysis and technological aspects. In any case the proposed design theme \u2013 the exhibition space \u2013 is an opportunity to consider this area in a more general reorganization and consolidation of the cultural town-centre. The project structure will take in consideration two important aspects: the relationship between the existing architectures and the water front and the strong characterization of the place, included between the oldest settlement of the city and the fortifications built in medieval times (Bromley et al. 2005). To exemplify this approach to the theme of the proposed project, it is necessary to look at the analysis of some projects. These projects have developed in different ways the issues proposed by the place, chosen as project area. These issues can be summarized as follows: the relationship with the Vltava river and its overlooking; the relationship with the existing convent and integration to the museum system of St. Agnes; the relationship with the characteristics of the site and its various urban settings; the architecture of the connections and the definition of the pathways. The importance of this method is to consider the practice of composition as a slow and careful approach, starting from the place where it takes shape, through a continuous progression to find the appropriate features of the architectural space. The space is perceived as a sensitive experience, able to stimulate the meaning and the essence of the architectural experiences. The architectural project, in this sense, becomes an important object of knowledge, and a real creative act. Our research attempts to set-up a procedure that has as main objective an experimental method to design, according to the resources of local context and focused on urban regeneration (Roberts 2000). An architectural project is a physical fact within the City, because it has a structure that makes it different from the other artistic practices (e.g. painting, sculpture, cinema, music and so on) and its responsibility is rather significant, because the project realized usually affects space and context in different way: through the physical impact; through the figurative impression; through the space suggestion.

Earthquakes have progressively destroyed Chilean built heritage over the years, not only due to the initial devastation they produce but also due to the applied reconstruction approaches that follow, which has been addressed using non-specific instruments such as social housing subsidies. Moreover, it often aims only to recreate the previous built form, dwellings that look \u2018as before\u2019, but using contemporary materials and building techniques, losing the progressive and sustainable culture that used to characterize their buildings. This raises the question of authenticity and its social and normative corollaries.

Historical buildings bring out the symbols of history, memories, social and culture of a place as well as representing the economic standard of the local people. It can be seen from the architecture style of the building, size and material used. That is why it is very important for us to preserve and conserve it not only for county\u2019s heritage and legacy but also making them as tourist attractions. Therefore, this paper is aim to identify the potential of retrofitting mechanism as Environmental Hybrid Approach (EHA) in conservation works on the historical buildings as well as to investigate students perception on retrofitting mechanism. Triangulation methods were used for this research. Retrofitting means fitting in new mechanism that was not installed during first construction. It can be adapted as cross-integrated mechanism and can be use in architecture sector. By retrofitting, the vacant historical building can be reused back for new purpose such as an office or theater that can be use to generate income while maintaining the historical values of the original historical building. Practically, this method also brings positive impact to the environment. Retrofitting is consider as an Environmental Hybrid Approach (EHA) in conservation works of historical buildings due to the facts that it use less new materials for new construction by reuse and re-enhancement back original material from historical building, reduce the production of construction waste thus minimizing negative impact to the environment. Retrofitting mechanism also undergo shorten construction period, hence it use less energy, less construction workers on-site and able to reduce the total cost construction compare to conventional construction.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W141147716"}}

In Korean modern architecture, locality was a value ignored with the introduction of international and universal modernist architecture. Special characteristics of specific areas and cities were not universally considered and so various localisms have been lost. Every local area has a version of vernacular architecture reflecting its unique local character and particularly Jeju traditional houses have such characteristics as to follow the environmental condition of volcanic island and the sociocultural singularity; hence, this speciality came to be noticed as an alternative to the singular environment and for the value added. This study intends to investigate the contemporary spatial and formal application of Jeju traditional architecture, thus outlining the characteristics of Jeju architecture by the natural and human-social environments. It analyzes 'Podo Hotel' designed by Itami Jun and 'Genius Loci' by Tadao Ando as buildings to which elements of Jeju vernacular architecture were applied according to the architect's intention, Looking into the local elements of Jeju traditional houses noticed by the architects in terms of building layouts, circulations, forms, spaces, and material characteristics, the study identifies how the elements are conflated into the architects' characteristics and spatial programs.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1926024055"}}

Second, kitchen shows more active function of communication in autonomous cooking operation rather than meal feeding operation. Third, its good to use the floor by using it for internal and external mediation rather than closing the door for actual use so that several can share it. Fourth, common bathroom has characteristic that only one person can use it due to the small scale of Hanok guest house, so communication function is not played.

This study is to suggest architectural types and characteristics of traditional style public buildings of reinforced concrete structure. Because the types of such buildings are very diverse, different from the case of residential architecture of the same style, proper classification criteria is essential for future design and evaluation. For each type of buildings classified by the degree of modern change from the traditional pattern, this paper compares and contrasts them under five different categories: building use, construction year, floor areas, stories, cost. The result of classification shows that among 44 buildings, the number of buildings that conserved the traditional character (classified as type A) was the largest (total 16) whereas that of the most abstract transformation from traditional (type D) was the least as 5. Partially transformed buildings which stand between conserved traditional and abstract traditional and were classified as type B and type C, each has 12 and 10 buildings. The number of these buildings has been increasing since 1990s and the purpose of buildings has expanded from exhibition and sports facilities to education and research facilities, medical facilities, and market places. The size of buildings are mainly 500-1,000\u33a1 and Construction cost per area of buildings found out to be mostly 500-1,000 ten thousand won per 3.3\u33a1. As a part of Korean modern architecture trend, there is a constant demand among people for the construction of these buildings with traditional origin, and there would be more of these type of building built in the future. Thus, we need a better way to determine size and cost of construction and direction of architectural design based on the architectural feature of original traditional building during the planning stage.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2124763443"}}

The study aims to investigate general characteristics of Jae-sil from an architectural perspective by grasping location, deployment, structure, and plan composition based on existing inhabited conditions in Jeollabukdo. Results derived from the study are as follows. First, the location of Jae-sil is classified into mountainous and village types, and the two types showed a similar distribution. The village type showed the most distribution in the foot of a mountain in the rear of village, while the mountainous type is close to graveyard. The Jae-sil were mostly exposed to south, southeast, and southeast, which was not significantly different from residence. For deployment of the Jae-sil, a \u4e8c shaped house, where main quarter and gated building are parallel located, can be common, indicating that additional attached building is less required. Second, for the platform out of structural components, coursed masonry was conducted by using natural rocks, and placed were a prop on the platform, first line on processed foot stone, and others on natural foot stone. For pillar, front line round columns, while others square columns. The binding type of the upper part of pillar is dominated by jangyeosujang and sorosujang. For wooden frame structure, 5ryangs were the most distributed, and out of these, 1goju 5ryang was the most generally used. For a roof part, it was composed with gambrel roof with single eave, and the roof was constructed by placing traditional Korean tile roof on the top. Third, for a size of Jae-sil out of plan composition, although the facade and the side of it were presented in a diverse manner, 4 facade rooms and 1.5 side rooms were the most frequently presented, and all Jae-sil were equipped with front ceremonial space. For spatial composition of Jae-sil, main floored hall is placed at the center, and each room is placed on the left and right side to secure space for ancestral rite for participants of it, and for a house with 5 rooms or more, it shows that main floored hall and rooms are weighted from side to side.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3176368412"}}

ABSTRACT Night watch guardhouse (gardu pos ronda) is one of Indonesian cultural uniqueness forms compared with other states remaining to exist up to now. In such the condition, guardhouse is also a witness of historical course from several eras accompanying. The uniqueness of guardhouse lies, among other, at its form and the system accompanying it. The structure of guardhouse is as same as other architecture construction, consisting of floor, wall and roof. Several guardhouse, by its floor structure, consists of kolong (space underneath main construction) floor and guardhouse exactly on the land. Amid the architectural culture abandoning kolong structure particularly in Java, the structure of guardhouse kolong is an interesting topic to study. It is because the kolong structure is the reflection of Javanese floor construction structure in the past. The objective of research is to find out: (a) what the structure of guardhouse construction is as the interior element; (b) in the present context, how the change of the development of guardhouse function is and what activities it serves in addition to guard security. In order to achieve the objective, the research method employed was a qualitative research. The research was taken place in Surakarta city. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling one taking all of guardhouses with kolong structure existing in RW 19, Kelurahan Mojosongo, Jebres Subdistrict, Surakarta City. Techniques of collecting data used were interview, recording, library study, measurement, and documentation.

In Japan, housing problems have been actively discussed at the civil level since the 1900s (the late Meiji Era). In particular, discussions were focused on the improvement of living spaces in traditional Japanese dwellings. Most plans for new houses were created for upper middle-class families. However, over time, Japanese houses gradually became Westernized and modernized. The design and positioning of children\u2019s rooms began to appear in house plans. During the Edo Era, most Japanese traditional houses did not include children\u2019s rooms. However, beginning in the late Meiji Era, the modernization movement increased the number of children\u2019s rooms included in Japanese modern housing plans. This paper assumes that the inclusion of children\u2019s rooms in Japanese housing plans expanded in relation to the modernization of housing. We examined changes in the positioning of children\u2019s rooms in Japanese detached houses by analyzing housing plan books first published during a period that began in the 1900s (late Meiji Era) and ended in the 1940s (early Showa Era). This study revealed that (1) the earliest children\u2019s rooms appeared during the late Meiji Era, although they solely appeared in a limited percentage of published house plans. The number of children\u2019s rooms increased after the Taisho Era. (2) Many house plans published during the early stage tended to position children\u2019s rooms on ground floors.

Viollet's ideas about conservation were born out of the French Gothic revival, but they capture the essence of ancient Roman civilization's penchant for connecting past, present, and future and, in turn, using building conservation to create new aesthetic qualities in Roman architecture. Conservation theory since the eighteenth century has emphasized conserving the aesthetic qualities of a building's original design. Attitudes about conservation in Roman architecture developed in the Augustan era suggest that fidelity to an original design was the exception, not the rule. Roman conservation, as best as it can be identified, played out in a practical environment in which a distinction between building and conservation was less important than the function of architecture as a marker of Roman identity.

Islam brings upon harmony and peace to mankind. From an architectural perspective, harmony is valued based on how a space is designed to bring comfort, peace and protection to the occupants. A comfortable home is a basic necessity. The design of a house has to be planned by taking into consideration the physical factors, environment and the major needs of the occupants. Unfortunately, nowadays the design of the modern Malay houses has neglected the factor of harmony which causes discomfort to the occupants. The design of the modern Malay houses no longer takes into consideration factors such as climate, the Malay culture, religious restrictions and the comfort of the occupants. This has consequently produced designs of buildings which are not conducive to be occupants. The solution to this problem is the Malay heritage architecture. This research will look into the benefits of the Malay architecture, specifically the Minangkabau architecture in Negeri Sembilan. The main advantage of the Minangkabau architecture is the ability of the craftsmenin understanding the needs of the environment while designing the houses. The living culture which is Islamic based has blended well among the Malays and the craftsmen have successfully materialised it in designing the Malay houses.Generally, the Minangkabau architecture clearly follows the Islamic concept in providing harmony and comfort to the occupants. This research attempts to see how the Minangkabau architecture has practically applied the Islamic concept in the modern Malay houses to build harmony and comfortable houses in terms of ventilation, the usage of natural sunlight, the design of nature-friendly space and the usage of space to preserve the tradition and culture which is based on Islam.

Focusing on this, this study tries to apply the characteristic of Han-Ok to an apartment unit plan more compositively beyond the fragmentary design application of existing preceding researches. To do this, the space organization, residential space and housing design elements of Han-Ok are deducted through preceding researches and case studies and proposes a plan by applying this to the apartment plan with a floor plan of about 132m\u00b2(40 pyeong). The apartment unit plan containing the characteristic of Han-Ok proposed in this study is planned based on the floor plan of about 132m\u00b2(40 pyeong) which is distributed the most in the city of Seoul. It has an advantage in terms that it can be individually applied not only when a construction firm progresses business anew carrying the banner for a Korean-style apartment but also an existing residents can apply through remodelling. Meanwhile, it has a limit that the diversified space sense and the advantage of an airy Han-Ok cannot be applied to many parts of the design due to the characteristic of an apartment of diverse height change. If a measure to secure constructability and economic feasibility while reflecting diverse differences of floor-level of an apartment can be prepared in follow-up researches, much more various advantages of Han-Ok can be put into the apartment design.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1927028208"}}

For apartment houses, after 15 years from the permission of using, remodeling with extension is possible. Design method could be classified for design of remodeling with extension as follows. Those include complex design method, residential unit design method, parking lot design method and resident welfare facility design method. 1) Complex Design Method The first thing to do in the complex design method is to find out the faults of existing complex and to search the method to backup. Among these methods, the first consideration is the channel of movement for the vehicles and pedestrians. With the considerations of channel of movement for the vehicles and pedestrians, main exit must be determined. And channel movement of vehicles except from emergency and moving trucks must be guided to the underground parking with short line, if possible. 2) Residential Unit Design Method Generally, this method would be designed mainly in order to overcome the problems of existing residential units. Firstly, optional type (variable type) plan could be adopted in consideration of residents\u2019 preferences. In case of corridor type apartment houses, after structural changing into stairs type, the privacy of rear rooms could be secured. In entrance room, sufficient closets and storage should be secured. And main bathroom and additional one should be separated. Living room would be secured in span considering modern pattern of life. Kitchen should be secured rational working space and sufficient closet with the consideration of housewife. 3) Parking Lot Design Method In the design of remodeling for the parking lots, considerations are as follows. Natural separation of vehicles and pedestrians, green space on the ground must be secured to the maximum limit with the minimum of ground parking. In an avoidable case, green space must be secured with setting of the decks. Parking lots must be planned for the construction of residential building in case of new underground parking. Channel of movement and vertical channel of movement should be considered with the underground parking and residential building. Skylight and sunken space should be planned with the consideration of natural lights and ventilation of underground parking. The position of ramp for exit should be planned in the place of free position with the pedestrian\u2019s channel of movement.Special exterior viewing could be checked. 4) Residents Welfare Facility Plan The position of the attached welfare facilities could be selected with the relation of planned channel of movement in the complex planning of the apartment houses remodeling. Revitalization method must be found for the attached facilities and exterior space. As the residents welfare facilities, lobby lounge, fitness-center, indoor golf training course, storage of parcel service, guest room, internet room, movie room, etc. could be installed.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2165147486"}}

Brasilia, born of the urban plan by Lucio Costa and of the unexpected concrete structural forms designed by Oscar Niemeyer, knew how to adapt to the new forms that came from the country's religious syncretism. This article aims to compare, through religious symbolism, structural forms and architectural spaces, two sacred monuments: The cathedral of Brasilia (1958-1967) and the stupa of the Tibetan Buddhist Center, inaugurated in 2006. The millenary construction form of the stupa, one of the primordial sacred structures for all Buddhism traditions, the sacred symbol of enlightenment, must obey some construction rules according to its lineage's Buddhist tradition. In this way, the stupa is the opposite of a strong and fearless structural form embodied in the cathedral, with its 16 revolution hyperboloid concrete pillars and its subterranean entrance.

In reconstructing a framework of architectural and design theory to be relevant to education and built environment and design in the Islamic world and which is capable to give rise to architectural and built environment form and design, there is a need to take a closer look at the values, revisiting the theories, trends and past tendencies in the past movements of architecture. As these theories are mainly rooted in Western architectural developments of the past, a reassessment of these theories in the light of fundamental Islamic values is deemed necessary. Such analyses and discourse will enable us to \u2018deconstruct\u2019 or analyse these theories through an alternative value system. As a whole, current theories of architecture are steeped in Western philosophies. These theories include past civilizational developments, artistic trends, tendencies, movements and technological achievements of their past eras. Within the framework of current architectural theory which dominate architectural history education, design theory, perspectives in mainstream architectural references, books and sources of architectural knowledge; architecture of the Islamic world and its ideas are not integrated as the mainstream development. Hence the architecture language and design that governs and influences the main stream architectural education and schools of thoughts with prevalent styles and trends are devoid of the Islamic world architectural contribution and its worldview. A reconstruction and development of a tawhidic value-laden discourse and theory is not possible without taking into account a revisiting and then a reconstructing of perspectives of these Western theories and histories. The aim of this paper is to look into trends on Western design, architectural movements and history such as the Arts and Crafts movement, the Modern Movement, critical regionalism, post modernism and de-constructivism, so as to unearth and analyse the values behind them. The analyses made through sieving the jargon and terms based on Islamic values can be identified and discussed while those absent of such values can be highlighted. Such de-construction and re-analysis is necessary before the re-construction of architectural thoughts, theories and principles based on the tawhidic paradigm can begin.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W102684740"}}

Even though the idea of altering an existing building is presently a well established practice within the context of adaptive reuse, when the building in question is a 'mnemonic building', of recognized heritage value, alterations are viewed with suspicion, even when change is a recognized necessity. This book fills in a blind spot in current architectural theory and practice, looking into a notion of conservation as a form of invention and imagination, offering the reader a counter-viewpoint to a predominant western understanding that preservation should be a 'still shot' from the past. Through a micro-historical study of a Renaissance concept of restoration, a theoretical framework to question the issue of conservation as a creative endeavor arises. It focuses on Tiberio Alfarano's 1571 ichnography of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, into which a complex body of religious, political, architectural and cultural elements is woven. By merging past and present temple's plans, he created a track-drawing questioning the design pursued after Michelangelo\u2019s death (1564), opening the gaze towards other possible future imaginings. This book uncovers how the drawing was acted on by Carlo Maderno (1556-1629), who literally used it as physical substratum to for new design proposals, completing the renewal of the temple in 1626. Proposing a hybrid architectural-conservation approach, this study shows how these two practices can be merged in contemporary renovation. By creating hybrid drawings, the retrospective and prospective gaze of built conservation forms a continuous and contiguous reality, where a pre-existent condition engages with future design rejoining multiple temporalities within continuity of identity. This study might provide a paradigmatic and timely model to retune contemporary architectural sensibility when dealing with the dilemma between design and preservation when transforming a building of recognized significance.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2908692314"}}

The wooden house in Bucovina evolved over hundreds if not thousands of years of permutations and assimilations to reach, by the end of the XIX th century, a coherent and rich original style that was diffused throughout the region. With a name derived from the Slavic word buk that means beech, the region thus named land of beech trees has always been and continues to be a very rich source of wood. Unsurprisingly, this was the material of choice for the houses in the land. Constructed entirely in wood, including apparent beams to the interior and exterior and wood shingles for the roof, the traditional house in Bucovina elevated the craftsmanship of woodwork to the level of an art. This is obvious when analyzing the constructive details or the ornaments that adorn the windows or the columns of the porch. Similar to the houses of the Moldavian region, on which the style originates, the pattern for the house in Bucovina implies larger dimensions, due to the abundance of the material, larger windows, classical proportions and the use of specific decorative elements.

Reincarnation of the Sacred Space:Issues in Adaptive Use of Hindu Temples in India Ashima Krishna (bio) Adaptive use has long been a sustainable and economically beneficial tool used by preservationists, architects, planners, and developers. It has been most popularly used for civic, industrial, and residential structures in not only the developed world, but increasingly in developing countries as well. In India's rapidly changing urban and rural areas, abandoned or vacated buildings have been reused in different ways as public and private institutions, offices, museums, and hotels. The reuse of abandoned houses of worship\u2014temples, mosques, churches, gurudwaras (the place of worship for followers of Sikhism), and synagogues\u2014however, remains a pertinent yet sensitive issue in India. Can a non-functional liturgical space be more than a repository of our past? Can it also be an essential and utilized part of its community? Background The Indian landscape is abundant with historic structures spanning a variety of time periods, made from different materials and for various uses. Most, however, escape any official (local, state, federal) attention. The federal agency in India responsible for the designation, maintenance, and preservation of nationally important historic structures is the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), similar to the U.S. National Park Service. ASI has more than 3,650 structures designated as nationally \"protected monuments\" (Government of India, 2011). Every state in turn has a state-level agency that designates state and locally significant structures. Other, undesignated private structures are often taken care of by a nonprofit or an advocacy group. Yet others either silently go to ruin within the rural/urban landscape, or are often put to some kind of unofficial use by the local inhabitants. While the exact number of historic structures existing in India (both protected and unprotected) is yet to be determined, the list [End Page 37] of nationally-protected monuments reveals that more than 48 percent of the total structures had some kind of liturgical use at one point in time. The majority of these religious structures belong to the Hindu faith, which begins to illustrate just how many unprotected and undocumented historic structures of religious value actually exist across the Indian landscape. Religious edifices, like other structures of historic value in India are usually either conserved or restored after they have been designated \"protected monuments\" at either federal or state levels, or by private patrons or (religious) trusts. The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), which is similar to the U.S. National Trust, often promotes the preservation of these unprotected sites by advocating and raising funds, hiring consultants, and entering into public-private partnerships. The \"protected\" structures that are not in continued religious use are, however, restored, preserved, or conserved by federal or state agencies as historic structures for tourism purposes rather than religious ones. This is primarily due to provisions in the federal legislation1 that prohibits the use of a \"protected\" structure for religious purposes if that was not its function at the time of designation (Government of India, 1958). Therefore for historic, protected religious structures of discontinued religious use, finding a new lease on life besides becoming a tourist attraction is difficult. Older, unprotected structures unfortunately share a similar fate. They typically face public opposition to adaptive use irrespective of their religious denomination. In the case of Hindu structures, these issues are more significantly manifested, given the volume of Hindu structures across the Indian landscape and an 80.5 percent majority in population (Government of India, 2001; Joshi, 2005, p. 130). Understanding the Hindu Temple A Hindu temple2 is believed to be a vehicle for the enlightenment and salvation of the devotee visiting the shrine, a cultural and social hub, as well as a celebration of the rituals and traditional religious activities of a Hindu (Marath\u00e9, 1998, p. 11). The earliest temple form took inspiration from the ancient tabernacles constructed by the pre-medieval man, even before Hinduism developed as a religion. The Hindu temple's actual evolution began with a small hut3 during [End Page 38] the Vedic period,4 which evolved into a modest timber structure, which then gave way to the highly embellished stone and brick structures...", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W290808389"}}

Nowadays Tall buildings are being portrayed as saviours of the world's cities problems of rocketing population densities, need for rapid expansions, scarcity of land for development, sprawling growth, heat island phenomena etc., Whereas the presence of Tall buildings in Historical or antiquity context is subjected to more scrutiny than in any other prevailing context in cities around the world. The good news is that the ingenuity of architects in striking the balance between the need to cope with current pressing issues (i.e., normally requiring advanced modern technology) without losing the spirit or essence of a particular historical context. That is normally achieved with conceiving cultural Iconography out of Tall buildings by employing symbols or elements from very intrinsic and/or indicative cultural dispositions within a given context and reproducing it through, form, texture, light, art, material, etc. producing an elegantly proportionate master piece of tall buildings that often transcend the dilemma of coping with the tradition and tackling successfully its intended goals. The main aim of this article is to exhibit globalisation trends in tall buildings that can adapt to local contexts through successful examples in the Middle East. Having said that, it is crucially imperative to emphasise that this trend doesn't lead to extinction of the local cultural influence.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the planning characteristics of certain cases of elderly welfare housing (hitherto EWH), and analyze any problems by comparing this against the actual needs of potential residents. To this end, 38 distinct housing plans from twelve EWH built after 2005 were examined, and a survey on housing needs was taken by 198 people between 48 and 62 years of age. The results are as follows: Firstly, the most common size found among the 10 cases was 42-66 <TEX>$m^2$</TEX>, however larger sizes are becoming more frequent. The most popular response on the survey was one favoring smaller housing options. Secondly, the most common floor plan examined consisted of 1 bedroom + LDK and 2 bedroom + LDK. Likewise, the survey reflected that 1 or 2 bedroom housing was preferred. Thirdly, a floor plan composed of a smaller bedroom and LDK is commonly found in smaller floor plans of EWH. The survey reflected potential residents preferred this same style of floor plan, with a smaller bedroom and LDK set up. However, lower-income participants preferred a single, larger bedroom which also can serve as a living space, to go along with a kitchen/dining room (DK). Fourthly, 2 bedroom housing typically included a single bathroom, however the survey indicated that participants preferred a second bathroom to go along with a second bedroom. Consequently, the planning of elderly welfare housing is to a large extent meeting the demands of its potential residents, however house size and the planning of bathrooms have yet to meet these demands, especially with potential lower-income residents when it comes to housing size and space composition.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1986364849"}}

Recently, the housing problem has been recognized as a matter of housing supply with a certain environmental level and not simply a matter of handing as a quantitative problem, and the demand for pleasant residential environments and requirements for residential environments are increasing more and more. However, it is necessary to establish the directions for improvement of the residential environment according to the house type, as the requirements and levels of satisfaction differ. This study aimed to deduce the level of resident satisfaction with the residential environments according to house type, and determine the direction for improvement of the residential environment. To achieve this, the difference between the house types was analyzed through ANOVA analysis and T-Test, and the major factors on the improvement direction of the residential environment were derived through Action-grid analysis.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2057740927"}}

Recently, the housing problems has been recognized as a matter of housing supply with a certain environmental level and not simply a matter of handing as a quantitative problem, and the demand for pleasant residential environments and requirements for residential environments are increasing more and more. However, it is necessary to establish the directions for improvement of the residential environment according to the house type, as the requirements and levels of satisfaction differ. This study aimed to deduce the level of resident satisfaction with the residential environments according to house type, and determine the direction for improvement of the residential environment. To achieve this, the difference between the house types was analyzed through ANOVA analysis and T-Test, and the major factors on the improvement direction of the residential environment were derived through Action-grid analysis.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2131311840"}}

This study was aimed at determining the characteristics of circular multi-family housing under the assumption that the shape of a residential building affects local identity. A total of six case studies were included in this study, three case studies on idle historical industrial facilities turned into residential buildings and another three on multi-family housing located in newly developed residential complexes. The study drew its conclusions as follows. First, the design of circular multi-family housing was intended to maximize security and defense from the outside in older times. This was later developed as the terrace house style with geometric urban squares designed under the urban planning of the Baroque period. This evolved high-density housing with a courtyard in the center offering a green open space, with the aim of restoring a sense of humanity. Second, the six case studies on circular multi-family housing were analyzed from the viewpoint of each factor of local identity, including historical and cultural, landscape, and community. Third, the historical and cultural elements of circular multi-family housing are found in some unused historical industrial facilities remodeled into residential buildings. They provide new capabilities and shapes desired by society at a given time, while maintaining familiar styles and elements of history, integrating a legacy of the past into the present. Fourth, circular multi-family housing with unique shapes and structures often become landmarks of a region with their distinctive appearance against a uniform urban environment and the monotonous scenery of residential complexes. They also show a high level of visual awareness with the distinctive shapes made possible when new elements are added to a historical exterior. Finally, circular mum-family housing with courtyards in the center prompt social contact between inhabitants, especially with dormitories and rental houses for the low-income bracket, which provide a small individual units with high use common space. Circular multi-family housing are planned in a manner similar to a small village or a city. They are designed to enhance sense of community, allocating various public amenities and provide cultural and commercial spaces on the ground floor and courtyard areas.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2199432065"}}

(2) RESEARCH METHOD In the research method, frequency analysis was conducted to investigate the general characteristic of the deserted building all over the country. Variance analysis, correlation analysis, hierarchial regression analysis were conducted too test the hypothesis that the external element of a deserted building and the element of construction suspension would have an effect on the level of the harmful effect (harmfulness class). Multiple regression analysis was conducted with the harmful effect(harmfulness class) as the dependent variance and with the number of stories, the number of buildings, architectural area, the stage of completion, the contract amount, and the deserted period as the independent variable. (3) RESEARCH FINDINGS The external element and construction suspension element of a deserted building have a different harmful effect(harmfulness class) on the neighboring area according to area, the use of the building, the construction suspension element. 2. RESULTS Analysis showed that the effect of the characteristic of a deserted building on the level of the harmful effect(harmfulness class) varied according to the area, the use of the building and the reason for construction suspension. In making a decision on the priority of the plan for improvement of the deserted building in the future, it is necessary to improve the deserted building having a high effect on the harmful effect(harmfulness class) according to the area, the use of the building and the reason for construction suspension.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2223109861"}}

This study is to analyze various design characteristics of block forms applied in a recent apartment housing design competition for Sejong city. It is expected to find the new design trend and good design characteristics of apartment building forms to use as the basic data of apartment housing design, because it is a case study on the ambitious design competition of the city that many major architectural firms in Korea entered and eager to propose new ideas. The results of this study are following: (1) The forms of slab block are classified into 7 types(the best applying ones are - and \u3131 type). The forms of point block are classified into 9 types(the best applying ones are \u3141, \u3134 and \u3161 type). (2) In slab blocks, the best applying ones for 4unit combination plans are \u3161 type and the best ones for 6unit combination plans are \u3131 and \u3137 type. In point blocks, the best applying one for 3unit combination plans is \u3134 type and the best one for 4unit combination plans is \u3141 type. (3) For entrance of slab blocks, the most general is stairway type, but in T-shape and \u2312-shape blocks gallery type occurs frequently. and hall type also occurs frequently in Y-shape and \uffe2_-shape blocks. For entrance of slab blocks, hall type is the most prevalent regardless of block shapes. (4) On the sloping sites above 4%, \u3161 -shape and , \u3131-shape blocks occur frequently in slab blocks, and \u3141-shape, \u3134-shape and \u3161-shape blocks do in point blocks.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2232038945"}}

In the study of vernacular architecture, verification of physical space and understanding social, cultural, and economic contexts are of central importance. Today the challenge is to create new ways toshare findings and invite dialogue. Our studies of early wooden structures in the Balkans have yielded publications and exhibitions on regions and buildings as well as our drawings and photographs. Today the Internet includes an increasing number of sites with images of vernacular buildings that survive orare being restored. A number of preservation institutes and other organizations are developing websites to reveal these cultural treasures. Within this context, we are working to produce an open access site with a flexible format to provide information that crosses national and cultural borders, that in some cases are more rigid as countries in the Balkans reinterpret their cultural heritage and their artifacts. This shift in presentation media and transformation in historical interpretations demand that we revisit our research and the way it is disseminated. This paper focuses on two aspects. First, it will present examples of misinformation created as national entities begin to redefine their identities. These include situations where historians, scholars, politicians andjournalists have created views that are more fantasy than actual. Second, we will show strategies that we are implementing in our website to allow others to view a database with bibliographic notes of Balkan vernacular architectural artifacts that cover the period from the 17th through the last part of the 20th century.

Abstract. This study embarked upon a premise that considers architecture of building as a dynamic phenomenon. A building from its conception is susceptible to change due to various reasons. An historical building that is several hundred years old must have undergone through changes due to political, social, religious and most importantly functional reasons. Hence capturing building and its dynamic evolution is necessary to appreciate its architecture as well as its heritage value. Whereas the conventional method of fact based historiography only captures the building in particular moment. It makes architectural historians to become perplexed over to which particular moment to be documented. It is a great challenge for the architectural historians to bring back these dynamic characters of the building that are mostly inconspicuous in nature from this point of time. In this situation the historical discourse also remains elusive and blurred. The idea of 4d capturing comes in front in this scenario. Current research would venture into this emerging idea to record the architecture of the early period. This paper highlights the need for a flexible tool to capture this dynamic character of the building. By citing the case study of the 7th century Buddhist Monastery in Bengal, this paper thus argues for the need of capturing the narrative of a historical building than the facts to get a complete picture of its architecture. This study aims at capturing the narrative of Sompur Mahavihara, the UNESCO World Heritage site in Bangladesh, which is currently in ruinous condition. However, it's few hundred years life suggests that as architecture it was subject to change due to different reasons, mainly political, religious and rituals. Being a monument that belongs to the flourishing phase of a society, traditionally this monastery architecture certainly played a role as a stage for religious and political pageantry as well as different religious performances. As architecture it works as complex process of interaction of different layers of ideas, agendas and authorship through time. This paper would further explore different tools for historians to capturing this process of interaction and preserving/ conserving the narrative of this building using virtual modelling.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2105861648"}}

Orchid Island is mostly populated by an aboriginal people called the Tao. Six tribes totaling 3000 people live on the island, coexisting among different cultures and traditions. The subterranean clustered buildings are the most particular confi guration of the island. These constructs demonstrate a conspicuous vernacular fi gure, refl ecting a high level of effi ciency and practicality, which corresponds with the local environment and the landscape of the island. Although the settlement space and the island\u2019s land use change gradually due to various socio-economic factors, the traditional subterranean buildings survive; they are conserved and used primarily by two tribes called the Langdau and Yehyin.

This study concludes the following factors connecting the urban and architectural plans. Oblong block plans following east-west direction did not allow the southern exposure of courtyard and main room, which was the absolute requirement for traditional house units, the longer side of block plan followed north-south direction as a result. Considering the possibility of rent, having entrance at the east or west side of individual site enables two separate household maintain their spatial privacy. In addition to the factors mentioned above, when the blocks are to be divided into individual addresses, north-south oblong block plans maintained the length to face the front road minimum while the southern exposure maximized. These factors explains why the private developers maintained their blocks elongated to north-south direction when the block plans laied out by public sectors which did not care that much of southern exposure show random orientation in the view point of solar exposure.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2043004647"}}

This paper argues that social cohesiveness could be operationalised in shared norms and trust, attachment to housing estate and social networking. It was found that the characteristics of social cohesiveness were different across the same type of public rental housing estates, and that this variance was partly due to the different conditions of the physical environment.

Deteriorated residential areas are rampant in Busan because new settlements were built indiscriminately by many refuses since the Korean War. Also, a great influx of people from rural areas caused by the Industrialization Era in the 1960s added to this problem. Busan began a housing renewal project for more urban planning. At this time policy settlements were created to force settlers to move into the outskirts of the city in order to solve the problems of reconstructing the citys inferior housing. However, there were shortages of infrastructure, limited dwelling space, and a high density population. Eventually, the problem worsened as deteriorating residential areas began to be too much of a burden for the residents and residential environment improvement project to solve this problem were urgently needed. This study performed a comparative analysis of the difference between two regions through resident surveys for effective residental environment improvement.

The quality of apartment houses has been gradually upgraded. However the changes in demographic composition of residents such as seniors, disabled persons, and etc. have not been considered in the process of planning. If apartment houses are designed on the base of the concept of universal design, their residents could live as long as they want to live in. This study evaluates the Korean standard-sized apartment housing units and the common spaces of those apartment buildings, and it\u2019s outdoor environments from the perspective of universal design. The observation and measuring was conducted with the questionnaire survey with 100 residents living in those housing units. 60 items were designed for evaluating them in relation to the principles of universal design. The results are as follows : 1) In general, the principles of universal design were relatively applied to the apartment houses. However their application needs to be broadened. 2) The number of parking lots needs to be increased and the width of individual parking lot to be increased. Also, the location of gazebo and senior center needs to be placed in easily accessible areas. 3) The shape, color, finishes of the ramp and the entrance area of the apartment building and housing unit should be made more homelike. Also, the entrance area of apartment building and housing unit needs to be made large enough for residents themselves and meeting with neighbors. 4) Among all of the rooms in a housing unit, bathroom should be improved immediately. Also, the width of doors should be at least 80cm wide and the floor should be made even.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1945571310"}}

In the past few years and as a result of the dramatic increase in national income that has accompanied the development of the oil industry, Qatar has undergone immense changes in its social, economic and physical environments. In less than half a century, the country has been transformed from a nomadic and subsistence farming economy into a modern urban/industrial society with a per capita income that is considered one of the highest worldwide. As a result, the demographics of the society have become more global and contemporary and international values and attitudes have impacted the existing cultural and architectural patterns. Qatari architectural trends have become increasingly contemporary and completely detached from the traditional ones that reflect the country\u2019s identity. Doha, the capital, has recently witnessed the resurgence of the discourse on Islam as a cultural identity.

The Sidi el-Mursi Abul-Abbas Mosque in Alexandria is one of Mario Rossi's best and most well-known buildings. Careful study of the working drawings made it possible to develop some important considerations concerning the construction methods imported into Egypt by Italian architects, engineers, contractors, and skilled workers, between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. Along with the documents in the family archive and some site photographs, it was possible to investigate Rossi's new methods of organizing t he building site and the relationships between design decisions, construction, and the dissemination of technologies. The new contribution made by this paper consists primarily of describing how this particular mosque was built, reconstructing the process by direct observation, and by interpreting Rossi's extremely complex working details, as well as surveying the building itself. The new approach imported into Egypt by Mario Rossi did not break with local tradition, whilst his introduction of reinforced concrete into Awqaf building practice exerted considerable influence and made him chef d'ecole and teacher for those who came afterwards. He was Chief Architect for the Egyptian Ministry of Awqaf from 1929 until 1954, and his approach to mosque design was an evident typological and stylistic innovation that left its mark on the architectural vocabulary of the time, establishing a new style that became widely adopted in Egypt and spread as far afield as Washington DC, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. In a perspective of international cooperation to which we are urged by various countries around the Mediterranean, the primary aim of this type of research is to promote knowledge of this recent heritage: a prerequisite for developing effective tools for its enhanced apprec iation, preservation, and recovery, for which the obligatory starting point must be the creation of specialised archives and atlases of works.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2243061063"}}

Since the early 2000s, block housing has been a topic of increasing interest, and planners have issued many block houses through design contests. The main purpose of the block housing was to promote the formation of community among residents, and supplemental plan has also been completed in order to support the previously envisioned level of residency which is weak due to the inherent characteristics of block style housing. Currently, there are several housing complexes which have been recently built in Korea. However, questions have been aroused whether the residents are as satisfied as the planners had originally intended. In the midst of planning a new block housing complex, this research was motivated with the hope of making a measure of improvement based on the result of the post-occupancy survey. Block housing complex shows various problems such as noise, privacy, access to sunlight, and security. These problems are closely related to habitability, so resolving such problems will transform the block housing into a more comfortable and meaningful housing type and also contribute to the future promotion of the block housing complex. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to develop planning elements for the improvement of habitability as part of developing an attactive block-style housing complex, discern the level of satisfaction with habitability, problematic spatial issues and amenities based on the post-occupancy evaluation of the cases of actual residence, extract measures of improvement and implement the results at the times of future planning. In accomplishing such goal, this research performed and analyzed the post-occupancy evaluation on two block housing complexes built in Korea. Eunpyung 1st District and Nokyang District were chosen for the research, which were built 5 years ago. The data and documents obtained from the on-site visits of the two districts were classified according to the 3 physical spaces: \u2018external space to the complex,\u2019 \u2018unit living space\u2019 and \u2018common living space.\u2019 Survey questionnaires have been developed in terms of the level of satisfaction, problems and issues related to the amenities of the 3 spaces. The survey was performed in the form of in-person interview by visiting individual residents in the districts. Total of 200 residents were interviewed, and the SPSS statistical package was used for the analysis. Contrary to the one\u2019s expectation, the overall satisfaction level was shown as satisfactory on major evaluation points of the post-occupancy survey. Preferred amenities were landscaping in the complex, walk trails and unmaned parcel storage. Noise from the children\u2019s playground, privacy from the neighbors, insecurity issued from the inept visitor control, main buildings with poor sunlight access, low level of reputation due to complexity of the apartment structure are some of the space-related problems revealed by the survey. Detailed drawings and verified data were proposed as the means of improvement on the issues and problems. Based on the research and evaluation results of the post-occupancy surveys, it was concluded that the research on block housing complex should be continuously pursued and results from the early design stage should be arranged as planned-out elements that later ought to be implemented, thereby a residential complex with higher quality can be planned out.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1921204024"}}

In modern society, an interest in new residential environment has been increased for those who seek rational and efficient space focused on various life-style. Especially, there is an rapid increase of single person households in urban region. This increase changes housing culture which is unified extremely one way to apartments in urban region, and it makes hard to find detached houses in the city. This social change makes a need of new living type. Therefore, there should be small housing activation plans of increasing demands. In this study, it focuses on the cases of small housing in Japan.

In modern society, an interest in new residential environment has been increased for those who seek rational and efficient space focused on various life-style. Especially, there is an rapid increase of single person households in urban region. This increase changes housing culture which is unified extremely one way to apartments in urban region, and it makes hard to find detached houses in the city. This social change makes a need of new living type. Therefore, there should be small housing activation plans of increasing demands. In this study, it focuses on the cases of small housing in Japan. As looking effective space plan about small housing, it is expected to know about tendency of future Korean urban detached houses. So Interior design changes shape of small space to various composition. Furthermore small house\u2019s interior design plan can suggests directivity of the small housing considered residential individuality and characteristic of space.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2968873721"}}

Houses from natural or recycled materials, heated by natural energy represent green building or sustainable architecture. In the wider context, the conception of ecology is applicable not only for a separate house, but also for the all town planning and architecture. This article is meant to describe several relevant ways to implement sustainable development in the historical territories of Lithuanian cities by seeking for a dialog between contemporary needs and the policy of sustainability. In 2008 the European Union has initiated a purposeful document \u2013 \u201c2030 Heritage Strategy\u201d. There is declared a holistic preservation of vital cultural heritage and its surroundings by comprehending, controlling, conserving and restoring it properly and promoting the appreciation of heritage as a cultural treasure of all the urban community. The document encourages arranging and reusing the existing buildings by invoking the innovative technologies. There are a lot of deserted, unused buildings in the historical territories of Lithuanian cities. First thing that should be done is to give the status of revitalization priority zone for the territories of historical surrounding. The revitalization would proceed by reaching for the balance between preservation of the existing resources and inserting new functions and elements. Obviously, the notification of revitalization zone will not take an effect itself \u2013 the changes have to be initiated. Therefore the governance of revitalization zones is so important. The specific field that waits impatiently for a \u201cgreen\u201d treatment is the old wooden houses of Lithuanian cities and towns. People often forget that a timber house, though not new, is itself a base of healthy microclimate. There would be enough to take care of suitable ways of heating and trimming and we would have an ecologic house. This would open a new field for architects\u2019 activity. In 2011 by the support of Kaunas City Municipality there has been started a database of Kaunas wooden architecture, which can already be used through a website (www.archimede.lt). Here a professional documentation of wooden architecture is being accumulated. It is expected that through this website the information will reach the house owners, administration of subdistricts and municipalities and gradually the understanding of the value of wooden architecture will be developed. We think that an educative support could grow into particular social solidarity program: people would share their knowledge and experience and a community interested in preservation of wooden houses would come into being.

Definizione di strumenti per la lettura del processo di caratterizzazione tecnologica e linguistica, con finalit\u00e0 operative per i fondi urbani della citt\u00e0 storica. Un caso studio: Ferrara. In preindustrial basic buildings, technological solutions that a local community processes to respond to specific needs are the lexical components of building language. Such processing takes place within the limits of a spontaneous behavior - which is aimed at finding the most economical resolution in terms of material and constructive knowledge - until the gradual progress of technological possibilities and the gradual weakening of the cultural and constructive limitations caused by the local-size of each community, lead to solutions gradually more elaborate than the initial spontaneous ones. This process is particularly interesting if it\u2019s related to the costitutive elements of building enclosure, which constitute the main vehicles of rework in construction, technology and formal solution- first relating to the local tradition and then to monumental architecture\u2019s codes- enriched gradually by the intentionality of architectural language. This process is particularly important in historical basic buildings, where urban tissue is readable in plan and elevation as a continuous organic and enclosure, in its specific connotation of facade, plays a key role in the characterization of building units. This applies in basic buildings rather than monumental architectures, because in monumental architectures all parts of the construction, such as the enclosure, are configured as costitutive elements designed to be representative of a coded language and architectural culture that often goes beyond the local traditions. Building language, as an anthropic product at minimum scale construction, it\u2019s a particular aspect of the spontaneous process in pre-industrial buildings that regulates transformations in building structures and urban tissues. The approach to its reading can be follows methodological criteria of morpho-typological basic buildings reading, with the aim of systematically reconstruct the logical spontaneous figurative and construction processuality of its elements. This investigation, based on a multi-scale reading of building transformations, can break free from considerations about uniqueness of building product and influence of specific actors in building process; these are evaluations that were otherwise inevitable in the case of investigations on individual building, especially in monumental architecture. It is possible to encode, and not only classify, basic building language to reconstruct systematically the figurative and construction processuality of its elements? It is possible to outline this method of analysis to develop a design tool to support cognitive actions on historical urban tissue? These are the questions that the research aims to answer.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1806950252"}}

Architecture represents the art of planning, designing, building and decorating. Also it reflects the identity, culture and social realities of whole civilizations, captures and converses with the environment of its inception be it the natural climatic environment or the values, norms and belief systems. The study of a given architecture, therefore, implies extensive knowledge about the society, its system of reference and its climate to properly identify and interpret the manifestations of all these factors in the art of building. The study of the traditional Kuwaiti architecture, which is the focus of this paper, requires an understanding of both the natural and social environment of Kuwait. The traditional Kuwaiti house was conceived in a time when traditions and rules drawn from Islamic precepts had the upper hand. It was also built in a natural environment characterized by extreme temperatures, the people who built them were simple people, with very little wealth, but very resourceful. All these factors produced a vernacular architecture that is highly compatible with various aspects of its environment. However, after the discovery of oil in the Gulf region in 1930, and the financial enrichment of the country, people started to opt for more modern styles of building for their houses. Such new houses proved very unbefitting to neither the Kuwaiti climatic environment nor the Islam-informed social climate. This paper introduces the traditional Kuwaiti architecture and highlights the positive attributes it enjoys and which should be preserved and optimized rather than supplanted by the introduction of new 21st Century architectural designs, thus contributing to the preservation of the ecology of the region and the world at large and accommodating the needs of Muslim desert dwellers such as the people of Kuwait in terms of comfortable and culturally aware habitat.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2460691483"}}

Abstract This study constitutes a new approach to quantitative analysis of people's housing preferences. Using medium-sized apartments in Beijing as an example, seven floor plans were developed and a questionnaire survey was conducted where the respondents were asked to decide between different pairs of floor plans based on their own preferences. Based on the data, the spatial properties of the floor plans were examined and sample families were classified by their attributes. Using a modeling approach, the preferences for housing floor plans of various family groups were estimated and discussed in detail. The results demonstrated that \u2018privacy,\u2019 \u2018south-facing,\u2019 \u2018storage,\u2019 and \u2018number of rooms\u2019 were the critical means of evaluation of the floor plans of medium-sized apartments. The preferences of different family groups differed significantly and most families were quite selective regarding floor plans. Thus, high-level customization is necessary in architectural design and information services. The preference indices revealed to what extent people were satisfied with different floor plans and suggested precise ways to improve satisfaction with regard to layout plans. In addition, the results implied that, for apartments smaller than 90 m2, essential functions or \u2018housing utility\u2019 must be given priority. In particular, a dining room and a study room were considered mandatory, but a separate storage room was not required.

Since the 21st century, major cities in Vietnam faced housing shortage and there was a lack in office spaces. As a result, construction companies from over seas provided mixed-use apartment as a new type of urban housing. A large number of mixed-use apartments are built in big cities such as Hanoi and Ho-chi-minh City. However, research on mixed-use housing in Vietnam is insufficient. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to understand the characteristics of mixed-use apartments and have an effect on the development of urban housing in Vietnam. This study focuses on examining the planning characteristics of mixed-use apartments in Hanoi. The research will be based on 10 mixed-use apartments that are already built or expected to be built in a few years. Therefore, this study starts by looking into the history of the Vietnamese urban housing. The study focuses on the transformation of urban housing since 2000.

Architects and social scientists criticize dully unified designs of the apartment complex culture and worry that the apartment complex culture is destroying a sense of community, and that it manifests collectivism. On the other hand, occupants are mainly concerned about property investment value, privacy, safety, convenience facilities. Meanwhile, the government is more concerned about active usage of bicycles, restoring village-type community and sustainable architecture.

Due to the processes of modernization, the existing traditional Thai houses have been changed from tradition to contemporary. Contemporary vernacular houses in the central Thailand are categorised as transforming and reproduction houses. This study focused on three types of vernacular houses in the central region: the traditional Thai house; the transforming Thai house; and the reproduction Thai house. This study examined the features in these contemporary vernacular houses which have been influenced by changing use of materials and construction methods. The study was conducted by examining the changes of vernacular houses in three locations in Ayutthaya province: the urban district village, the rural village and the motorway buffer area. Data were collected with the uses of materials, construction types, and features of construction elements. The data obtained were analyzed and discussed through typological analysis and constant comparative analysis to reveal the differences of vernacular houses among the studied locations. The findings show the ways in which vernacular traditions have been integrated with modern influences. The development and change of use of materials are indicated for reflecting the evolution of vernacular Thai houses. The results reveal that, from the earliest period of modern Thai industry, contemporary vernacular Thai housing has been influenced by materials available and construction methods employed. Industrial materials have been used to improve the performance and change the appearance of the traditional Thai houses. Because of the availability of early industrial materials and construction methods, the transforming Thai houses will therefore continue to be sustained by their current owners. Traditional and modern materials are applied to the reproduction Thai houses with updated construction techniques. Vernacular Thai houses are confirmed as a continuous process and appreciated in the context of the present. The results of this study offers some clues to support an understanding of living heritage, and thus promoting conservation of vernacular buildings in Thailand.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W750236445"}}

Harmonization between architecture and nature is one principle deeply rooted in traditional Japanese architecture, infl uencing all aspects of space creation. Buildings are not seen as individual objects, but as part of the existing environment, resulting in the development of design principles which enhance these qualities. Although there are many components in traditional architecture which promote these principles, one of the most important ones is boundaries. Through the precise control of boundaries, a space can be given a new meaning and even perceived in a new manner. Traditional screen systems known in Japanese as \u2018shoji\u2019 give spaces the fl exibility needed to adapt to a changing environment, given the inhabitants control of views, illumination and ventilation. This adaptability of traditional spaces has been studied through a case study of a single tea room, which was then simulated through 3D modelling software, permitting the analysis of the space during different times and seasons.

To prove the hypothesis, the article's research methodology starts with determining and understanding the uniqueness of Tokyo and influential factors in the city's formal state. Then, 50 samples of urban single-unit residential houses are chosen by random selection from the archdaily website. Statistical analysis expresses the specific tendencies in formal types of the samples, as the hypothesis states. Results declare the tendencies as: narrow and elongated forms, introverted with surrounded and internal yards and balconies, some facades without decoration and mostly white or grey with low area of glass, white internal space. Understanding formal typologies and tendencies in Tokyo's contemporary architecture as a developed city has useful trainings for developing cities and countries like Iran to have better decisions in architectural and urban design in the future.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2242034045"}}

Due to human beings\u2019 aesthetic sense, they have always been engaged in embellishing their living environment throughout the history. Given the different culture, customs, beliefs and even varied policy of each society, the applied arts or decorative styles have constantly been evolved. The Qajar architecture was influenced by Russian and central Europe styles, and by combining them with the Iranian traditional architecture a unique style in its kind was born. Many palaces and buildings were constructed particularly, during Naser-al din shah era which were tried to present some unique and combined views of their owners power and greatness. Although Masudieh complex and Qavam alsaltaneh building were built during two different architectural periods, clearly show the particularities of the Qajarid architecture. So selection and comparison of these buildings will manifest ornamental arts changes during end of Qajarid era. The paper is trying find any similarities and dissimilarities between these decorative elements and to provide required answers to the questions being raised with regards to the specialties and styles of decorative components of the two buildings, by using collected data through library research, dissertations, documents and field studies an analytical and descriptive method has been applied in this respect. Anyhow, the available documents show that no comparative studies have been made so far in the field and only some hints are given concerning the history of Qavam building and Masudieh complex.

Abstract The paper summarizes the reconstruction of the historical building erected in the 14th century, during the times of the residence of Grand Master of the Teutonic Order Winrich von Kniprode, currently referred to as the Latin School. It characterizes the location of the Latin School in the urban conservation area of the town of Malbork. The building is situated in the stretch of the buttressed brick escarpment on the Nogat River in the line of the historic defensive walls of Malbork. The paper also outlines the history of this building, constructed and managed by the municipal authorities of Malbork, which for a long time was a seat of a Patronage of Saint George and the Merchant Guild, and next, from the 16th century until 1864, the building housed a school where basic Latin was taught. Next, the situation of this historical monument in the 20th century is discussed. In the next part of the paper, the geological conditions of the site where the building was erected are discussed. The conducted archeological and architectural exploratory research related to the historical building with a particular emphasis on historic preservation and restoration works focusing on the building and its surroundings is presented and analyzed. Currently carried out design, construction and adaptation works allowing new functions to be embedded into this building are also discussed. The paper shows the benefits due to the realization of the reconstruction program of the degraded building of the Latin school in the historic quarter of the town. These activities are aimed at the conversion of the currently derelict building by means of embedding new functions into it. There are being designed, among others, an interactive educational center modern library, astronomical observatory, craft museum and multifunctional hall, allowing proper conditions to be created for the development of educational, artistic and tourism related activities in the reconstructed building. The reconstruction of the historical building is a positive response to its deterioration resulting from former activities and it will contribute to the improvement of the quality of cultural life of both local inhabitants and visitors.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2043379481"}}

The term Yukotai means porous body. Hiroshi Hara, one of the most famous Japanese architect, began to develop his Yukotai Theory in 1965. Yukotai refutes the validity of Modernism\u2019s homogeneous space and its unity of form. The main concepts of the theory are as follows. First, a basic architectural unit(usually a room) is designed as a \u201cclosed domain\u201d or spatial unit that corresponds to an individual within society. Second, covering is the outer layer of a space, in other words a building\u2019s frame and exterior. Third, aperture in this covering are based on various factors such as air, light, heat, energy and information. Through this shaping process, the closed(or dead) space is transformed into a living space. Hara\u2019s three completed projects, the Ito House of 1967, the Shimoshizu Primary School and the Keisho Kindergarten of 1968, could be regarded as attempts to implement the Yukotai Theory. This paper investigates the outline of the Yukotai Theory and analyzes those three completed projects that were based on the theory. Then in the final part of the paper, the implications of Yukotai Theory and its influence on his later works of following period will be discussed.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2136690731"}}

In the relationship between contemporary architecture and built heritage, the concept of actualization (as a cultural phenomenon) offers an alternative to the opposition between old/new. Even if new architecture in old buildings has existed for 2,000 years, it became an important issue in the field of conservation during the 20th century.The explosion of new forms in contemporary architecture, together with the rise of iconic architecture and so-called starchitects, seems difficult to reconcile with the extension of heritage signification\u2014semantically, geographically and spatially. However, new architecture within an existing fabric is sometimes necessary for economic, environmental or functional reasons, as well as for the sake of heritage. It is thus part of the actual praxis. From relic-object, heritage converts itself into a dynamic project, thus creating a particular and independent architectural style.Actualization is a way of reinterpreting heritage by giving it meaning through action (as in this case of grafting contemporary designs onto existing structures). This process of communication acts as a response to the obsolescence of heritage; by transforming a site\u2019s representations and significance with a contemporary language and by intertwining itself in the patrimonialization process.The resulting architectural hybridity helps to create a mediation space that is both physical (with the architectural forms) and symbolic (through heritage and its representation).

Modern architecture is partly responsible for disappearance of wood carving in Malay architecture. Wood carving is an art that portrays the identity of Malay traditional architecture. There are more than 20 carved components of a traditional Malay building which include ventilation panels on walls and above doors and windows. However, little is known on the complexity of the carving which has been passed from a generation of woodcarver to another. This study aimed to identify the trend on the complexity pattern of floral motifs on the carved ventilation panels fitted on Malay traditional buildings which from the period of 1840s to 2000s in the states of Kelantan and Terengganu. Data of carving motif were obtained from a set of 16 measured drawings from the Centre for the Study of Built Environment in the Malay World (KALAM) at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. From the drawings, 32 carved components were analyzed using point pattern and visual descriptive analysis to find the changes on floral motifs. The results were then triangulated with the views of two craftsmen. It was found that eight types of ventilation panels were used in four types of buildings which were palaces, mosques, houses and resorts. The patterns of the carving are categorized into floral design element, element design character, compositional pattern, principle design and principal form. For example, similarities and differences in floral design element existed in flowers, branches, tendrils, flower buds and leaves. As indicated by the value of variance to mean ratio, the complexity of carving differ from one building type to another. It means that the carvings found on mosques are not necessarily more complex than the palaces or houses. It also means that the pattern of buildings in Kelantan was not necessarily more complex than those in Terengganu or vice versa. The inconsistency on the complexity of pattern can be attributed to the reigning government, social status of owners, skills of craftsmen, and placements of carved components onto the buildings.

For structural performance, such high-rise residential buildings come in the form of towers, as opposed to the flat, plate-like forms of the conventional apartments that have been built in Korea for nearly half a century. Because of this dramatic change in the building form, one can expect the spatial layout of the inner spaces have changed accordingly. By comparatively analyzing the layouts of unit plans of high-rise residential buildings between Korea and America, we were able to find dramatic changes in the planning principles of Korean projects, where early projects adopted planning principles of the previous plate-like apartments, in comparison to the later projects that more or less resemble the American projects.

This study focuses on the regional characteristics observed in the composition and floor plan of folk houses in the Young-cheon region situated in the Southern East inland of Gyungsangbukdo. According to the typical characteristics of the Korean folk house, Young-cheon region is supposed to be classified as the Young-Nam region. Our study shows that the open inverse '\u3131' type composition is the most common among others, which consists the living room, UtChae and one BoosokChae that serves as a living room and a farm shop. The typical floor plan is called 'Young Nam type' 'Htjib' composed of four rooms. Young Nam type of house has a wall in front of the room floor with a door to make the space with the room floor as the internal space. This can be explained by the climatic conditions in the Southern region of Gyungsangbukdo, which has a very cold winter and has a harsh spring wind in Young-cheon. The structural feature to which we should pay attention is the Young Nam type house has a gambrel roof. The evolutions of the house in the 70s are observed in the roof during the Saemaeul Movement from a hut to a modernized roof. In the 80s, the replacement of the heating system, expansion of rooms, modernization of kitchen, replacement of paper windows, modernization of roof, and construction of amenities had taken place to change the space, construction and structure following the modern house features.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2241435578"}}

There have been numerous researches on Nak-An village in Jeollanamdo, one of the most representative traditional castle village in Korea. Most of them have dealt with general and physical architectural scale and features separately. Therefore this study aims to understand the compositional characteristics of building layout and exterior space and the relations between street system and dwelling unit of folk houses in Nak-An village. The study examined houses of ordinary people in Nak-An village constructed before the village was not affected by foreign influences. 36 folk houses in Nak-An built from nineteenth century to early twentieth century and believed to have few physical changes from the original floor plans and architectural forms were the subjects to be analyzed. The most popular types in building layout are \u201cOpen L\u201dand \u201cOpen U\u201d. The most typical orientation of main building is Southwest. The favorable entry into the dwelling lot is from the side. The street system in the village consists of main streets of South-North, resulting in dwelling lots with North-South axis most general. This site condition forces the entry into the lot from North main street and the side access to the main building. From these findings, the building layout and the entry into the dwelling lot of folk houses in Nak-An are strongly related with street system and conditions of dwelling lot.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2562010789"}}

Pilotis are often used as parking lots in newly built one-room houses. There are illegal equipments and illegal parkings around one-room village. Second, residents satisfy with proximity to workplace. However, they show strong dissatisfaction with physical environment such as noise, air flow, waste disposals. In particular, they feel very uncomfortable with gloomy lights and fear about potential crime. Third, residents like their independent lives, but complain about narrow living space and unprotected privacy.

The architectural aesthetic design has been a powerful influence and a rich source of reference to the formation of novel ideas throughout the early stages of architectural history. The implementation of architectural aesthetic design by applying historical precedents has generated significant impact on the overall quality of the built environment. A notable historical architectural precedent known as the Isfahani style, during the era of Safavid Architecture is proposed in this doctoral study to possess highly attractive aesthetic values with respect to the current contemporary Iranian architecture, specifically Iranian architectural designs built in the last five decades. The main objective of this study was to investigate the architectural aesthetic design features experienced by the users and nonusers of the Safavid buildings. Additionally, to identify and validate the design criteria that make Safavid Architecture still highly useful and relevant in terms of how it expresses architectural aesthetic design features. Furthermore, the values and attributes used in the design processes found in today\u2019s contemporary architectural phenomenon possess little evidence of a design approach that places importance on the architectural aesthetic experience. Hence, this research explored the historical precedent of Safavid Architecture by examining chosen historical buildings, using qualitative multiple case study techniques and by collecting data from multiple sources for each of the case studies. The sources included direct observational data collected through video and audio documentation of the cases being studied, semi-structured interviews with experts, and a perception study survey using questionnaires given to users and nonusers of the Safavid architectural buildings. The findings, obtained from experts\u2019 interviews were used to validate the findings obtained from users and nonuser\u2019 perceptions through cross checking and triangulation. Research findings and results were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Data analysis included categorization of themes defined by a theoretical framework through content analysis of patterns and a systematic redefinition of categories after validation. The veracity of the research was improved by triangulating the data obtained from multiple sources. The findings suggested positive and favorable analysis results, lending proof to the premise of the study. Additionally, three chief themes were uncovered with its unique design values, attributes and approach, which could be used to form the basis of a historical, architectural precedent. The analyzed results highlight the importance of aesthetic design characteristics, which include systematic process, and design concept, interaction with spatial and physical context, identity, meaning, rationalism, structural honesty, minimalism, unity, pattern, ordering principle, and paradigm of design. In conclusion, the research provided a framework for a holistic theoretical explanation, summed up based on research findings related to the issue being researched.

We discuss the improvement with other researcher and designer based on outcome of the research. The results of this study are as follows. First, Contrary to our expectation, result shows that Block types have higher floor area ratio than tower types. Second, The block types are desirable to be built in the quasi-residence area. Third, The effective guidance for enhancing diversity of housing block types and strengthening connections between housing and streets are as follows. -the reducing the percentage of contribution, -the alleviating measure -the alleviating the official restrictions of the collecting units of housing. Forth, the design of block defining structure should be considered from the early stages of its urban design, and it should be supported by the institutional devices. Therefore, to enhance diversity of the types of housing block, the connections between Streets and Housing Design should be first consideration in the housing development.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1503337085"}}

Except religious and aristocratic buildings, most of the constructions and houses in the first ages of the former European cities and towns are made of cob and timber. The gradual transformation of this architecture in stone and brick constructions \u2013 the so-called \u201cpetrification\u201d \u2013 is one of the most important processes within the cities and towns. Nevertheless, until now, this phenomenon has been little studied by historians and archaeologists (for instance Lilley 2002; Schofield & Vince 2005; Clark 2009). Therefore, the modes and chronology of these progressive architectural transformations are still uncertain.\u201cPetrification\u201d is a significant process that makes it possible to approach a new range of important issues in urban history. It concerns the general aspect of the cities and towns and stands for an obvious change of the landscape and the evolution of material culture. From a social viewpoint \u201cpetrification\u201d changes the way in which houses are in contact with each other and it consequently modifies town politics as well as the relationship between neighbourhoods. In conclusion, \u201cpetrification\u201d changes deeply the urban life. From an economic viewpoint the \u201cpetrification\u201d process has important implications on the organisation of urban supply of building materials. The town-countryside relationship progressively evolved: suburban forests, clay deposits and stone quarries are form now on subject to control attempts and new management strategies. In the same way the urban market connections with regional and international trade flows also change to meet the new urban needs concerning buildings.By integrating the different viewpoints of this complex issue we propose to elaborate a new methodology taking the former city of Brussels (duchy of Brabant then former Low Countries) as example : building archaeology data will be combined with dendrochronology, dendrology, radiocarbon dating and rereading of historical sources in order to bring further clarifications and to go beyond the traditional architecture history.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1530777796"}}

The aim of the thesis was to discuss preconditions shaping the modern Japanese single-family dwelling. The typical characteristics of the Tokyo cityscape were crucial for the general development of architecture. Urbanization and weak planning regulations have created unique low-rise districts. The density of the urban fabric has created specific architectural solutions in the average house. Many features in houses published in architectural press depict common solutions in the average area. Economy has also been an important factor. The price of land is very high in proportion to other building related costs. The actual building costs are proportionally lower compared to the land price than in many other places and because of this the redevelopment frequency of properties has become high. The drawings are from an architectural competition in the city Calahorra in the north of Spain. The idea of the project was to use primarily single-family dwellings to create as high density of population as an area containing taller buildings. The urban solutions were based on situations found in the low-rise districts of Tokyo, this is an attempt to formalize the urban patterns that have developed through long processes in Japan.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1596598215"}}

Every natural environment impacts the society that inhabits it and studies on mountainous regions all over the world have substantiated this claim. The impact of natural environments can be seen in the architecture, life and culture of those who live in mountainous regions.\u00a0 The influence of architecture is physical and caused by the geography and climate of the mountainous regions and the practical difficulties involved in constructing buildings. For centuries traditional houses used locally available materials. It is only from the early 20 th century that traditional homes began to change in terms of the housing materials used. Traditional architecture in Kurdistan was largely built without formally trained professionals. No architect or planner ever designed a traditional house. The planning of a traditional house was developed by the people according to their needs. Traditional houses have changed over time to fulfill the demands of the inhabitants. The aim of this paper is to identify the natural design principles of traditional houses in Kurdistan according to availability of local materials. Different kinds of house such as mud and stone house were developed in different regions of Kurdistan. Many designers are now interested in adapting traditional features to modern design but such attempts have had limited success because traditional house design have not been clearly understood. This study can help to develop an understanding of traditional house designs by analyzing traditional homes in the mountainous regions of Kurdistan.

In the phase of main investigation, the physical characteristic by the pilotis at each complex has been investigated in detail after dividing from the angle of \u2018the openness\u2019, \u2018the accessibility\u2019, \u2018the spatial utilization\u2019 and \u2018the surveillance\u2019 by selecting 8 complexes with the comparatively higher ratio of household out of complexes comprehended in the preliminary investigation. The pilotis type has been divided into largely as \u2018the overhanging type access + the pilotis addition type\u2019 and \u2018the pilotis access type\u2019, each physical characteristic has been compared and analyzed respectively. The conclusion of this study is as follows; First, the pilotis type of apartment in the new city Dongtan, Hwaseong may be classified largely as \u2018the overhanging type access + the pilotis addition type\u2019 and \u2018the pilotis access type\u2019. Second, \u2018the overhanging type access + the pilotis addition type\u2019 are insufficient state compared to \u2018the pilotis access type\u2019 from the angle of \u2019the openness\u2019, \u2018the accessibility\u2019, \u2018the spatial utilization\u2019 and \u2018the surveillance. Third, \u2018the overhanging type access + the pilotis addition type\u2019 is adopted method to achieve the advantage of two methods as the in-between format between \u2018the overhanging entrance\u2019 method and \u2018the pilotis access type\u2019, however it can not strengthen the advantage but rather may result in the dead space if the consideration for the planning of \u2019the openness\u2019, \u2018the accessibility\u2019, \u2018the spatial utilization\u2019 and \u2018the surveillance\u2019 is insufficient.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1946170082"}}

Architectural Form China's accession to the world trade organization (WTO) marks China's formal entry into the world economy circulation, mutual harmony with the economic and exchange to make national science and technology and the common wealth of people, so as to break each other segmentation state of multicenter, move towards the world synchronization integration process. The building as a culture, it is the economy, technology, philosophy, art elements such as organic synthesis, with space-time and region. At the same time, as a ecological system, building, with the development of economy, the progress of science and technology, culture and information sharing improves, even in a certain period can used as the carrier of regional culture and national culture refining and sublimation, widely recognized and accepted by the world, thus has been international. Regional and national architectural culture under certain conditions can converted into an international architectural culture, international architectural culture can also absorbed, which is the fusion of new regional and national architectural culture. The challenge came on December 11, 2001, when our country has formally become a member of the WTO. Accession to the WTO not only means that our country's economy will integrated 2nd International Conference on Management Science and Industrial Engineering (MSIE 2013) \u00a9 2013. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 639 into the tide of world economy and other aspects, such as ideology will be closely contacted with the world. Especially in the field of culture, to join the world trade organization, means that China's social development in eastern and western culture collision and fusion. The diversity of culture is by far the human basic facts. The fact is so; because the value system (as the realistic) nature has certain diversity. The modern western culture is a kind of strong culture, with strong penetration and attractive. After entering into the WTO, the east and west fusion and conflict, can make the Oriental culture, especially Chinese traditional culture under the influence of foreign culture and assimilation, appearing the so-called cultural convergence phenomenon. Culture, has a variety of meaning [2]. The House Design City high-rise residences, as a kind of residential building type, which is closely linked with the public in the of the building (external) design should reflect history, spirit, culture and geographical features. That planning layout should livable is considered as the primary premise. Research purpose and meaning of the second quarter residence is the social, economic and living body comprehensive reaction, in particular, in building the large categories, bearing the brunt of the housing to the best reflection of age and social status. Under development in the new century, China city, small and medium-sized housing construction should considered not only adapt to the environment (external) form, inheriting culture; At the same time, should respect the aspirations of people: planning and full of human science and technology, low carbon configuration. These have become important topic in today's urban high-rise residences design in our country. In residential construction is increasingly emphasized by humanism, cultural heritage and environmental protection\u201d, the three major themes of today, the humanistic pursuit of residential and pleasant in the first place. Residential buildings, as the environment of mediation, especially urban high-rise residences: its construction (external) shall coordinated with city region, environment.

To help in the design of the city of high-rise residences, for our country city high-rise residences offer reference for the innovative research, and to bring some inspirations for the future sustainable development of the cause of the human settlements in China [3]. Since 1998 in our country gradually stopped the welfare of the housing distribution system. As the current situation, the development of residential construction speed is quick and the market is active. Geared to the needs of the broad masses of people of small and medium-sized residential demand is one of the biggest plan in our country in 2010 when the per capita housing area of 25 m2, 2010 worth of 80 m2. The most construction on the market at present is the kind of housing, economy applicable room by state policy support based on the standards for development and construction, which was welcomed by the masses of low-income families. Here refers to small and medium-sized residential that also occupy an residential area of 70m2 ~ 70 m2.

This paper presents the findings of an Undergraduate Research Experience Program (UREP) research project funded by Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF). This interdisciplinary research project brings together architecture and sociolinguistics students and faculty members to develop a socio-cultural understanding and interpretation of the structures, designs, and physical dimensions of traditional elements employed by the members of the traditional society of Qatar from two complementary perspectives. The focus of this study is on identifying the multiple meanings and physical representations associated with elements of architecture, exemplified in the case of Qatari traditional architecture. These multiple meanings are dealt with from both architectural and multimodal discursive perspectives. The rationale behind this interdisciplinary approach is the fact that these two approaches are complementary to each other. This is because architecture spaces and elements act as a field and context where peoples' practices and activities take place, Hence, these practices are intricately interwoven with the architectural, i.e. structural and design, peculiarities of the individual spaces. One hundred Qatari traditional elements were selected for the purpose of this investigation within a framework of multimodal analysis. This approach takes into consideration the multiple modes through which meanings are constructed, i.e. building materials, structures and shapes of buildings, types of people who are entitled to use a particular building, activities that are organized around a space, to mention just a few. The project offers the opportunity to undergraduate students and faculty members from diverse disciplines to collaborate in an interdisciplinary research project, and thus to benefit from each other's background knowledge, ideas, and skills. The study recommends that this multidisciplinary approach be applied in undergraduate, postgraduate and other scholarly research pertaining to the study of traditional architecture and urban heritage. It proved to provide a better understanding and to serve as a strong motivation for students to engage themselves in research than an unidisciplinary approach.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2059593249"}}

Unfortunately the government has focused on expanding the quantity of housing even though housing doesn't mean just a physical object but the foundation of life. So the occupants who answered the survey lived in the permanent rental housing which were constructed by Busan Metropolitan Corporation. The purpose of the study is to give suggestions which can make up for dissatisfaction and apply preference of occupants based on the results of the research. The result of this study is in following; there were few significant managerial variables determinants of residential satisfaction. And significant variables are; position of rooms and bathroom facilities in internal building characteristics, color of apartment and playground in exterior building characteristics, commuting distance and viewshaft in locational characteristics. Therefore, the government needs to use cutting edge housing technologies aimed at improvement of residential environment and achievement of affordable expense simultaneously.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2065986973"}}

The purpose of this study is to look into the weight-lightening phenomenon of the roof structure of some Hanok(\u97d3\u5c4b), the Korean traditional houses found from the survey on the distribution and actual state of urban traditional houses existing in the whole region of Jung-gu, Daegu, Korea. As a result of judging from the pre-test of building registers for the research area, approximately 5,000 wood structure houses were found. A field data survey based on these findings showed that there are 1,752 Hanok houses. And the further classification of the Korean traditional houses by roof structure type shows that about 35% of them underwent weight lightening. While this kind of light-weight Hanok is different from the concept of traditional Hanok, they also show the survival method of Hanok that reflects the economical and technological phases of that period. It is expected that deeper understanding on the urban traditional houses will be possible through carrying out in-depth researches on techniques of the light-weight roof structure of the urban traditional houses that are supposed to have functioned as dwellings as commercial products.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2223617016"}}

The housing culture of Korea has grown quantitatively focused on apartments. As a result, human life has become uniform and residents have been severely alienated. In the face of such problems in the current housing culture, cohousing has been suggested as a means to increase the diversity of dwellings and spur community revitalization. The purpose of this study is to provide fundamental data for cohousing activation. For this, it was performed to classify the type of cohousing and analyze the characteristics according to the type of cohousing. The results showed that cohousing types have developed in various ways depending on residents' attributes, architectural characteristics, development characteristics, and the type of ownership and management. Each type has different characteristics with respect to both physical features and social elements related to community. Based on the results, development types for cohousing activation are proposed. First, for welfare housing, rental cohousing may be developed by public institutions for the specialized residents, such as the elderly. Second, as a special housing product, privately owned cohousing may be developed by estate development companies for a variety of residents. Finally, for community housing, jointly owned cohousing may be developed by residents", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2224688236"}}

Shop-houses are traditional buildings in Southeast Asia, commonly with a shop on the ground floor and residence above the shop. Malacca is one of the historic cities in Asia, and designated as a World Heritage Site. In this study, we conducted the field survey on the facade color of shophouses in Malacca, and discussed the facade color of shop-houses in Malacca and town-houses dwelling with shop called Machiya in Kyoto comparatively. As a result, low saturated colors were used on Machiya facade in Kyoto, on the basis of \u201cDesign standard for buildings and others\u201d including color design standards. It was shown that facade design of shop-houses in Malacca was different in each era, and many colors were used in the late era of England colony. It was also shown that facade of some shop-houses were repainted in vivid color, and these facade might detract the landscape in Malacca. INTRODUCTION Shop-houses are commonly seen in Southeast Asia. They were built in large numbers from the 17th century thorough the early 20th century. Their structure is two or three stories in height, with a narrow frontage but long depth backward. They have one or two internal courtyards, and have a public arcade called \u201cfive-foot way\u201d or \u201cveranda-way\u201d. They are commonly with a shop on the ground floor and residence above the shop. The design of the facades of shop-houses is very versatile by age because it is influenced by the culture of the ruling country. They have formed a unique landscape of the city, while receiving the culture of the Western European countries by colonial rule and culture of indigenous. Malacca has been designated a World Heritage City in 2008 since it became a colony Portugal, Holland, England and has left heavily culture of these countries. The townscape consisting of old shop-houses was to be preserved by Antique Act (1976), Town and Country Planning Act (1976) and Restoration and Conservation of Cultural Heritage Enactment of State of Melaka (1988). But these laws and regulations do not define the color of the facade of shop-houses concretely. On the other hand, Kyoto is one of the historic cities in Japan, and designated as a World Heritage Site in 1994, since Kyoto has a substantial number of historic buildings and has the largest concentration of designated Cultural Properties in Japan. There have been many traditional shophouses called \u201cMachiya\u201d. Kyoto city enacted a \u201cDesign standard for buildings and others\u201d in 2007 [1]. In this standard, the use of the color, the R and YR over Chroma 6, Y over Chroma 4 and other Hue over Chroma 2, are prohibited, except the original color of wall materials. It was reported that the bright colors of plaster wall and mud wall were rated highly, and the dark colors of the red iron oxide (Bengara), bricks and wooden wall in the historical district, and also that the landscape color in Kyoto became brighter in recent years, but it is necessary to think about the landscape colors in Kyoto which make the best use of the characteristics in the historical deistrict [2].

Polyvalency is a concept by which a house can accommodate a varying degrees of usability in the process of time while preserving its initial structure and finish. It is one of the most efficient concept for sustainability because it can prolong a life-span of a house without demanding a building-material consumption and waste. The primary aim of this research is the development of a polyvalent house plan that can be adapted to the various life style.

This paper treats the architectural developments in Sungai Tenang since the occupation by the Netherland's Indies in 1902 until the present. During this time great changes have occurred, among them the virtual disappearance of the traditional houses with carved planks. At the same time, much of the architectural developments can be described as the evolution of a still basically Austronesian house structure. Both these changes and the continuities merit close scrutiny, since they together reflect the persistence of the house as a powerful symbolic form that is capable of expressing changing social structures and cultural values. Up to the present, architecture in Sungai Tenang, in spite of its often modern outward appearance, is still by and large vernacular in the sense that its constructive means, its symbolic forms and its uses are firmly rooted in local traditions.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2258015336"}}

Traditional houses were constructed based upon the religious beliefs of residents and the traditional architecture applied Quran and Sunnah in architecture and city planning. Therefore, the traditionally-built houses are always infused with a religious spirit. The paper has been inspired by the following question: What is the relationship between Islamic identity and traditional housing? According to Quranic tenets and the Infallibles\u2019 (AS) sayings on house and residence, the characteristics of Islamic identity and the relationship among them can be recognized through criteria of Islamic identity. The present paper is a field study founded upon a historical-descriptive-analytical research method and that its data has been collected via a library research method by studying hard and soft documents. The results of the research indicate that the religious identity of traditional housing can be categorized into three distinct criteriastructural, environmental, and semantic. The three criteria are inseparable and overlap one another. It means that the characteristics of religious identity first become known in structure. Then they are fortified in the environment and finally reach a lofty status through semantic relations.

The piloti, elevating the building above ground, is one of the most characteristic modernist structural types. This element also has spatial implications, as recognized by Le Corbusier's \u201cFive Points\u201d and exemplified in his \u201cVilla Savoye (1928-31)\u201d. After World War II a number of such houses made their appearance in Japan. Here we aim to illustrate and examine how Japanese architects of the time extrapolated a design theme from this model, based on a study of such work as it appeared in architectural publications. Initially, two aspects of the piloti concept were selected, and each scheme was then subjected to a \u201cKJ-method\u201d analysis (originated by KAWAKITA Jiro). First, we scrutinized the architect's intention in adopting a piloti scheme. Secondly, we attempted to assess each architect's distinct view of the spatial character of the prototype, as exemplified in his deployment of the piloti model. At this point, the composition of each house was assessed with regard to two aspects involving the relationship between building and ground, namely the interrelation of building to site and to its natural gradation. Finally, the mediation between each architect's thinking and the final composition has been plotted in terms of this dual classification.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2319198037"}}

The study aims to investigate general characteristics of Jae-sil from an architectural perspective by grasping location, deployment, structure, and plan composition based on existing inhabited conditions in Jeollabukdo. Results derived from the study are as follows. First, the location of Jae-sil is classified into mountainous and village types, and the two types showed a similar distribution. The village type showed the most distribution in the foot of a mountain in the rear of village, while the mountainous type is close to graveyard. The Jae-sil were mostly exposed to south, southeast, and southeast, which was not significantly different from residence. For deployment of the Jae-sil, a \u4e8c shaped house, where main quarter and gated building are parallel located, can be common, indicating that additional attached building is less required. Second, for the platform out of structural components, coursed masonry was conducted by using natural rocks, and placed were a prop on the platform, first line on processed foot stone, and others on natural foot stone. For pillar, front line round columns, while others square columns. The binding type of the upper part of pillar is dominated by jangyeosujang and sorosujang. For wooden frame structure, 5ryangs were the most distributed, and out of these, 1goju 5ryang was the most generally used. For a roof part, it was composed with gambrel roof with single eave, and the roof was constructed by placing traditional Korean tile roof on the top. Third, for a size of Jae-sil out of plan composition, although the facade and the side of it were presented in a diverse manner, 4 facade rooms and 1.5 side rooms were the most frequently presented, and all Jae-sil were equipped with front ceremonial space. For spatial composition of Jae-sil, main floored hall is placed at the center, and each room is placed on the left and right side to secure space for ancestral rite for participants of it, and for a house with 5 rooms or more, it shows that main floored hall and rooms are weighted from side to side.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2408480531"}}

Since the early 2000s, block housing has been a topic of increasing interest, and planners have issued many block houses through design contests. The main purpose of the block housing was to promote the formation of community among residents, and supplemental plan has also been completed in order to support the previously envisioned level of residency which is weak due to the inherent characteristics of block style housing. Currently, there are several housing complexes which have been recently built in Korea. However, questions have been aroused whether the residents are as satisfied as the planners had originally intended. In the midst of planning a new block housing complex, this research was motivated with the hope of making a measure of improvement based on the result of the post-occupancy survey. Block housing complex shows various problems such as noise, privacy, access to sunlight, and security. These problems are closely related to habitability, so resolving such problems will transform the block housing into a more comfortable and meaningful housing type and also contribute to the future promotion of the block housing complex. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to develop planning elements for the improvement of habitability as part of developing an attactive block-style housing complex, discern the level of satisfaction with habitability, problematic spatial issues and amenities based on the post-occupancy evaluation of the cases of actual residence, extract measures of improvement and implement the results at the times of future planning. In accomplishing such goal, this research performed and analyzed the post-occupancy evaluation on two block housing complexes built in Korea. Eunpyung 1st District and Nokyang District were chosen for the research, which were built 5 years ago. The data and documents obtained from the on-site visits of the two districts were classified according to the 3 physical spaces: 'external space to the complex,' 'unit living space' and 'common living space.' Survey questionnaires have been developed in terms of the level of satisfaction, problems and issues related to the amenities of the 3 spaces. The survey was performed in the form of in-person interview by visiting individual residents in the districts. Total of 200 residents were interviewed, and the SPSS statistical package was used for the analysis. Contrary to the one's expectation, the overall satisfaction level was shown as satisfactory on major evaluation points of the post-occupancy survey. Preferred amenities were landscaping in the complex, walk trails and unmaned parcel storage. Noise from the children's playground, privacy from the neighbors, insecurity issued from the inept visitor control, main buildings with poor sunlight access, low level of reputation due to complexity of the apartment structure are some of the space-related problems revealed by the survey. Detailed drawings and verified data were proposed as the means of improvement on the issues and problems. Based on the research and evaluation results of the post-occupancy surveys, it was concluded that the research on block housing complex should be continuously pursued and results from the early design stage should be arranged as planned-out elements that later ought to be implemented, thereby a residential complex with higher quality can be planned out.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2561417192"}}

The prospects of the destruction of the existing town structure by spontaneous infill construction are quite realistic, which requires not only critical discussion, but also strong opposition to antisocial forces. A city stopped to be a comfortable environment for a human.A number of estimations is put forward, which characterize negative trends in modern city architecture. They represent the object of technical analysis and positive recommendations, which should be regarded a creative mechanism of influence on the practice through the theory.The intensity of social and economic transformations as givenness of modern reality radically changes the mentality, esthetic and space perception of the living environment, opinions on the value interrelation of new and old in building. All these requires heightened positive reasoning and constructive, maybe even tough actions.The danger of losing the face of Russian architecture is also essential. The reason for this is in epidemic copying by native architects, who are fascinated by foreign masterpieces eccentricity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2561767104"}}

Physical concepts of time in relation to historical and modern architecture are considered in the article. A number of tendencies in the evolution of architectural phenomena and methods of restoration of historical monuments are criticized. Attention to formation of new paradigms associated with identification of the physical status of time is driven.Comparison of the historic and the present-day information has proven the synchronism of existence of spontaneous and organized beginnings in the creation of the architectural environment, especially now when the government loses control over urban planning programmes that are managed by the private capital.There is an opposition between a traditional vision of an urban environment as the systems of historically stable images and conservative comfortable representations, on the one hand, and actions aimed at sanitation, improvement of public services and transportation networks, on the other hand.An unsuccessful experiment involving the design of Gasprom headquarters in St.Petersburg is a lesson of admissibility. New buildings should not suppress the environment.In the past, architecture appealed to feelings of monumentalism, stability, while present-day fast-to-build structures often look like fake products. Ancient buildings grow old beautifully. Present-day new buildings don\u2019t grow old, their destruction is accompanied by formation of a heap of garbage composed of bent metal stripes, fragments of broken glass and plastic that never loses its bright colors.The problem of preservation of a family of wooden monuments in the Russian North is particularly relevant, as no actions can extend the life span of a wooden structure beyond 300 years. The architectural monuments of the Kizhi island are on the verge of destruction.The pulsation of technological and artistic fundamentals as catalysts boosting new architectural directions has the vector of development focused only onto the future and fixed by the anisotropy of time. Nothing confirms the thesis that \u00abanything new is the forgotten old\u00bb, there is only an accumulation of archetypes of figurativeness and processing methods, and any reincarnation, including the architectural one, is only a symbol, the dramatized reminiscence which is in its own way attractive.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2563214480"}}

The similar remodeling action to the literary survey is the extending living room's and the other room's area by getting rid of adjacent balcony in the 1st and 3rd floor. But the remarkable remodeling actions are various devices for the privacy in the 2nd reception hall and the clearing away of bathroom in the 1st floor to adjust the unfamiliar housing type designed by foreign architect who doesn't know korean life style well.

Since 1917, under the action of political economic and socio-cultural factors the succession in development of those towns had been broken, which put certain marks upon those historico-architectural environment. In the transformation of the revealed five stages, for any of those out the main trends (negative and positive) in the aspect of reservation of the architectural singularity of towns and objects of the historico-cultural heritage were found. The current condition of a historico-architectural environment of middle and small towns of the region was examined. It was specified that now their architectural-building development follows one of the three main directions: an active growth, a relative stability and stagnation. The threats and advantages that had each of those variants were reveatled, advanced ways of the saving of historico-architectural environment were elaborated.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2591674020"}}

The authors argue that the problem considered in the paper is not easy to tackle. The point is that the need to preserve historic built-up areas is hardly reconcilable with the need to upgrade the urban infrastructure. A social conflict is inevitable in this context.

When transformation of railway system became a fact, many changes appeared in the way they work. In connection with technological advances, which support the needs of modern rail the facilities have changed. Many objects of historical architectural value are no longer used, they no longer serve their original function and they go to rack and ruin. The special historical and architectural qualities of these objects, their locations, visibility and the fact that they constitute specific points in space, are indicating their great potential. The possibility of renewal and adaption is justified, and water towers should become the matter of interest, and should be adopted for various functions.

Kish, which is located in the south of Iran, is an island that has more than one thousand year history of architecture. It is known as one of the most important free trade-tourism zones and holiday destinations of the country, and it has become an increasingly popular destination for investment in housing. According to official statistical reports, all the houses in the island are generally known as second homes for their owners. Modern development in Kish Island has led to the destruction of vernacular architecture and the loss of intellectual capital that flows from this. The main issue in this context is that most of the houses do not correspond with their owners\u2019 requirements especially in the context of local circumstances. This research  posits that the vernacular architecture of Kish Island, through its adaptation over a long time to local context, has the potential to provide a more appropriate response  than the mis-constructed styles that are currently undermining the architectural design of the second homes in the island. It also emphasizes on the physical and  socio-cultural aspects of the vernacular architecture in relation to second homes, the owners and their interaction. Therefore, the study utilized qualitative or quantitative research methods although preliminary qualitative methods were used to answer the research questions, \u201cHow can vernacular architecture be applied in designing the contemporary second homes in Kish Island?\u201d The research used a qualitative research methodology to identify the features of the Kish Island\u2019s vernacular  architecture as well as to find the relationships between the vernacular architecture and second homes. The research also used the quantitative method to support the  qualitative methods and to select units of analysis. As a case study, this study selected Kish Island in Iran and sought to develop architectural solutions to contemporary second home design problems with using adapted vernacular  solutions. The research outcome is a series of guidelines for developing second home design solutions to address the contemporary design problems. The suggested  outputs for second home design not only improve its quality for answering owners\u2019requirements but also employ second home design for enhancing local architecture.  Finally, the research provides a theoretical and experimental approach to support the development of practical and competent constructions in the architectural design field. The implications of the research to the design of second homes are important  while advocating the suitability of human requirements which has not been completely investigated and the expected results could be contributed to a specific  cultural and geographical domain of Iran, as well as countries in the Persian Gulf region.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2794514732"}}

The first Museum of a new kind of open air museums appeared in 1891 in Sweden and was named the Skansen-museum after the name it was organized in. It exhibited buildings and furnishings, tools and memorials, and as his founder Artur Hazelius said, ''It was devoted to folklore and the history of civilization. Skansen-museums in Russia were established in the early decades of the 20th century. For example, there was such a museum in the former Manor of Grand Duke Nikolay Mikhailovich Romanov near Petrograd in 1919-1922. In the late 1920s an open air museum like Swedish Skansen was organized in Moscow, in the former Tsar estate Kolomenskoye. It is important to note that there were attempts to create a new type of Museum in Tomsk. Those attempts were connected with creating of the Siberian Regional Science and Art Museum. In order to make this Museum a special Committee for the Siberian Regional Museum was organized in February 1911. The members of this Committee, Baron B.A. Aminov, F.Ya. Nesmelov and explorer of Siberia A.V. Adrianov, proposed the establishment of a museum to preserve and study the culture of the peoples of Siberia in a natural landscape. And they used Hazelius' idea of preserving and representing culture of ancestors at the Skansen open-air museum in Stockholm. They developed a plan to move dwelling and household buildings of northern aboriginals of Tomsk Province to Tomsk, placing them in the Park area in the southern part of the city, on the bank of the Tom River. The plan was backed by the Tomsk Duma, which had allocated a plot of land covering an area of more than 7.8 hectares at a territory of modern Lagerny Garden, struggled to find sources of funding for the new Museum. Architect T.L. Fischel and university botanist P.N. Krylov drew plans for the open-air museum. There were developed the ways of forming the museum: B.A. Aminov was ready to transport aboriginal buildings to Tomsk, Museum Committee Chairman F.Ya. Nesmelov published an article in newspaper ''Siberian life'' and invited citizens to participate in the scientific field trips to collect material. A.V. Adrianov, who was in exile in Minusinsk District, made a scientific trip to the South of Eastern Siberia, where he made archaeological excavations, visited and observed the ancient Russian settlements. The projected Scansen-museum was not opened in Tomsk, but the attempts to create it were significant: first of all, it was the integration of Tomsk researchers and world museums and their willingness to understand and implement the latest museum ideas and projects.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W282171193"}}

This study is to analyze various design characteristics of block forms applied in a recent apartment housing design competition for Sejong city. It is expected to find the new design trend and good design characteristics of apartment building forms to use as the basic data of apartment housing design, because it is a case study on the ambitious design competition of the city that many major architectural firms in Korea entered and eager to propose new ideas. The results of this study are following : (1) The forms of slab block are classified into 7 types(the best applying ones are \u3161 and \u3131 type). The forms of point block are classified into 9 types(the best applying ones are \u3141, L and \u3161 type). (2) In slab blocks, the best applying ones for 4unit combination plans are \u3161 type and the best ones for 6unit combination plans are \u3131 and \u3137 type. In point blocks, the best applying one for 3unit combination plans is L type and the best one for 4unit combination plans is \u3141 type. (3) For entrance of slab blocks, the most general is stairway type, but in T-shape and \u2312-shape blocks gallery type occurs frequently. and hall type also occurs frequently in Y-shape and -shape blocks. For entrance of slab blocks, hall type is the most prevalent regardless of block shapes. (4) On the sloping sites above 4%, \u3161-shape and \u3131-shape blocks occur frequently in slab blocks, and \u3141-shape, L-shape and \u3161-shape blocks do in point blocks.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2963232040"}}

This study is to find the plans for enhancing diversity of housing block types and strengthening the connections between housing design and streets. We categorized housing block types based on literature review, and compare each group\u2019s floor area ratio and the light condition to one another through comparative analysis. We discuss the improvement with other researcher and designer based on outcome of the research. The results of this study are as follows. First, Contrary to our expectation, result shows that Block types have higher floor area ratio than tower types. Second, The block types are desirable to be built in the quasi-residence area. Third, The effective guidance for enhancing diversity of housing block types and strengthening connections between housing and streets are as follows. -the reducing the percentage of contribution, -the alleviating measure -the alleviating the official restrictions of the collecting units of housing. Forth, the design of block defining structure should be considered from the early stages of its urban design, and it should be supported by the institutional devices.

After several centuries of prosperity, Iovia was most likely devastated during the invasion of the Goths in the late fourth century AD. The tradition of urban life was not abandoned ; instead, this Pannonian settlement has existed in continuity up until today. During the four seasons of excavations (2008- 2011), a smaller balnea and sizeable building with a portico were discovered in the very centre of Ludbreg (Somo\u0111i Garden). An optimal plan for presentation was made with all due consideration for the site\u2019s specific situation. By applying principles of cultural management and interdisciplinary cooperation between the national government, the municipal authorities and researchers, it was possible to provide a sound, legally secure future for this site. Objective of this paper is an overview of positive results obtained by implementing management principles from research to presentation i.e., giving new purpose to a cultural monument in compliance with the principles of sustainable development.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3163985970"}}

At the beginning of the 19th century, caught within the ring of the massive walls of the fortress, Timi\u015foara town had been hardly defining its new profile. From 21 military buildings, 20 were situated in the inner side of the fortress. In 1807 this town and its church represented the target of the orations of one young bricklayer who had arrived from Arad: he was also asking for a house in this settlement. e story turned real: for four decades the builder had built princely houses, administrative palaces, barracks, hospitals, churches and record houses throughout the historical Banat. His name had become well-known in the villages and towns of this region. Anton Schmidt \u2013 a former pupil of Franz Pumberger, a builder of fortifications in Aradul Nou \u2013 had more unacknowledged projects before becoming a significant member of the guild in Timi\u015foara. At the time of his first marriage, with Anna Frantz in 1809, the documents mention him as a simply \u201cMurar\u201d. He participated, for the first time in 1818, in a contest promoted for the construction of an inn named \u201cAt the Queen of England,\u201d in the suburb of the Fabric district. Scheduled with halls for dancing and playing billiards, the building had to offer several rooms for travelers too. e edifice, designed from a symmetrical viewpoint, with a central risalit on its fa\u00e7ade, and its fronton sustained by four columns with Ionic capitals, which tower a terrace at the first floor level, the exterior of the ground floor decorated \u201cin rustica,\u201d had not been approved by the management board of the town. In 1834 Anton Schmidt signed onto the project of a Communal eatre, a building which was supposed to be raised within the inner side of the walls. Its fa\u00e7ade re-engaged the clearer and more balanced elements of the unachieved inn. He proposed a new edifice, with some modern stage equipment, an easy access (separate entrance for the artists and public), a comfortable ground floor and dress circles on the floor for the onlookers, and ball rooms for the high life public too. Yet, because of low financial resourses, this project had not been finalized either. In the meantime, the tireless architect also designed other important and utilitarian buildings: a factory and a wine storehouse (Pesac village), a treatment resort (B\u0103ile Buzia\u015f), and manor houses (in Herneacova, S\u00e2ngeorgiu, Beodra/Serbia). He constructed an impressive number of barracks for the army in the fortress of Timi\u015foara or in the region, he designed and built the Town-Hall (currently the Town Museum) and the Hospital in Pan\u010devo (Serbia), a new one storried barracks in Timi\u015foara (1836), he added some more floors at the Catholic Seminar and executed some repairs at the St. George Church. He traveled to Austria and Hungary and returned with the cathedral project from Eger (Hungary, made by J\u00f3zsef Hild). In 1841 he proposed the construction of a church for the believers from C\u0103lacea, several plans for Catholic (with 300 or 500 people) and Orthodox churches, in 1835 he signed a plan for the Evangelic Lutheran Church in Timi\u015foara. e documents in 1836 mention him as an outstanding member of the society in Timi\u015foara: \u201cMuratorium Magister et Selecta Civica.~ Com~unitatis Membrum\u201d. Getting married, for the second time in 1823, to Anna, the sister of senator Franciscus Mayer, he succeeded in founding a happy family. He was the first builder who had influenced the architecture in Timi\u015foara through his activity. His buildings, most of them scheduled on three levels (wine cellars, ground floors and one upper floor), were characterized by balance, reason and few classical ornaments (columns with Ionic or composite capitals, pilasters, gates marking the axle of the building developed symmetrically on the horizontal level). e more important edifices benefited by one more floor and an attic mounted on classically symbolic sculptures. Only a few of creations have been preserved. e greatest part of the buildings meant to the army (e Genista Barrack, e New Engineers\u2019 Barrack etc.) was demolished when the town was brought up to date. e one-storried castle from Elemir was sold as construction material. We have no information related to the manor house in Banatsko Aran\u0111elovo (Serbia) nor to the Barracks of the Cavalry Squadron in S\u00e2nnicolaul Mic (today part of Arad). In Timi\u015foara, in the old historical centre, there is only the imposing building of a business man, Franciscus Xaverius Strohmayer, watching the town out of its numerous windows. He retired in 1851 with a considerable fortune visiting Italy twice. He remained a consultant regarding the important buildings of the town: he elaborated the development plans of the Old Prefecture Palace, he modified his own house in the Iozefin Suburb, sold to the Gendarme Station (1857), he designed for his relatives, he drew and dreamt of ideal familial residencies. Some of these, incomplete drawings and projects, were deposited to the museum in 1908, certifying the fact that... the beseech of the young builder had been finally accomplished.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4244865630"}}

This is the first ever monograph on contemporary architectural practice in Bangladesh, dedicated to international-award-winning architect Mohammad Rafiq Azam. Rafiq Azam is a world-renowned architect. He recently received the Residential Building of the Year Award at the 2012 Emirates Glass LEAF Awards, which took place during 2012 London Design Festival. He has a holistic approach to design, which not only incorporates the elements of nature but also harnesses its beauty and potential in a practical way, in order to enhance the personal experience of a building. From his uniquely Bangladeshi perspective, the human being has two parts the body as shell and thoughts as soul; and his architecture is similar, where the building manifests as the shell and nature as its soul. Considering the socioeconomic and city planning conditions of Dhaka, Bangladeshs capital, Azam's architectural vocabulary is kept simple and essential, with traditional spaces like the courtyard, pond, ghat (steps leading into water) and ample internal and external greenery that merge both urban and rural typologies in an intensely urban context. He arranges water courts as swimming pools in the middle of homes, arranges natural light rooms and unfolding wall systems to emphasise the interrelationship between form and void.

However, Scamozzi doesn\u2019t show an obsession about Palladio\u2019s proportion. Palladio expressed the symbolic meaning of the villa as the center of surrounding rural scenery by having same porticos for all four facades of a square.

These loggias help lighting and ventilation of rooms located behind of loggias.

Among the significant contributing elements in shaping the skyline of every city are the towers. Every tower is considered a landmark which provides a profound meaning and importance to the city\u2019s skyline. The role of towers can be discussed in semantic, aesthetic and visual aspects. Further than that the scale of their influence on the city is also noticeable, which is discussed in macro and micro scales in this paper. High-rises in different historic periods are considered and functioned as a tribune for presenting the society\u2019s mind. Many obligations and requirements of different periods of history can be analyzed through tall monuments of many societies. Therefore, a framework of judging and interpreting the tall monuments is shaped. Considering the mentioned fact, it is necessary to know public spontaneous interpretation of high-rises. Unity, solidarity and continuity should also be considered in the design and planning of every unique tower. Nowadays, the height of the building is no more a concerning issue and more attention is paid to persistence of the building as a permanent cultural symbol in macro scales. Probably, the main problem in planning for Tehran city is the goal of achieving maximum height for Milad Tower and not achieving a tower which reflects local and indigenous symbols that can become global. Milad Tower does not properly match the skyline of Tehran and the city view. It can probably be concluded that it is connected inappropriately to the skyline, because there are less tall buildings in Tehran. This paper tries to discuss the influence of Milad Tower on urban facade and view of Tehran in macro-scale based on theoretical framework regardless of the functional aspects. Regarding the researches and studies it is concluded in this paper that Milad Tower has not been successful in representing Tehran as an urban landmark.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3209416871"}}

Viticulture in Rahovec is relatively well developed. There are two main wine cellars for grape processing and vine production. i) Stone Castle found in 1975 and, ii) Bodrumi i Vjeter (Old Cellar) build in 1953. Also, it is important to mention here that there are dozens of small wine cellars which were established since 1999. \u2015Bodrumi i Vjeter\u2016 have a production capacity of 5.000.000 million L, and it used to be a social enterprise, however, since 2006 was privatized and belongs to NTP Haxhijaha. This paper is using \u2015Bodrumi i Vjeter\u2016 as a case study.

After being purchased / privatized in 2006 by Haxhijaha family, the owner is interested in renovating the original building with the latest design trends. Therefore, the above mentioned building will be used as a case study. By renovating this traditional wine cellar which was industrial and closed to the public, we aim to make it accessible to the public, therefore, there is a potential to encourage visitors/tourists to visit Rahovec not only for buying the wine but also visit the vineyards where they can taste the grape, visit the winery where they can see/witness wine processing (during the season) and, finally wine tasting complemented with traditional food. In addition,\u2016 Bodrumi i Vjeter\u2016 will provide accommodation for visitors within the area, as well as, day tours depending on what the visitors want to see/experience during their stay.

It analyzes and compares the periodic characteristics of building arrangements in divided plots as well as the composition of interior space in buildings arranged when the new urban residential areas were organized. Based on this analysis, the objective is to discuss why a specific Urban Hanok type was selected as an ideal housing standard and how it spread at that time. Case study sites selected for this study include the residential area of Gahoe-dong during the 1930s, Bomun-dong during the 1940s and Yongdu-dong during the 1960s. First, the typological differences between Urban Hanoks formed through urban planning will be examined for each case study. Second, the differences in space composition for tri-form Hanok building areas (body and two separate wings) as well as the differences in building arrangements within their plots will be meticulously analyzed. This study will conclude that the cultural conservativeness of traditional Hanoks was maintained, but at the same time modern rationality was pursued at the early stage of Urban Hanok formation. In addition, the diversity of Hanok forms was secured by differing plot allocations in relation to streets and modifying Hanok types according to site conditions. However, uniform layout and model copies became apparent in the later periods of Urban Hanok development.

A method to provide shared housing with minimum dwelling units was planned by specialists in the West in the early 20th century and affected government managing apartment houses in Korea. The tendency to make shared housing can be summarized as two steps : First, minimum dwelling units are planned. Integration of spaces which have similar programs and commercialization of making food are related features of minimum dwelling units. Second, specific programs which cannot be put into the units due to their small size are planned as shared space. Shared housing holds a potential to enhance a communalized way of living. The government managing apartment houses in Korea from the 1960\u2019s to the early 1970\u2019s were equipped with minimum dwelling units. Commercialization of making food was attempted but the culture of making traditional Korean sauces and storing them in the house did not easily change. This cultural tendency triggered unique plans of Korean apartment houses which enables dwellers to store traditional sauces.

In Kampong Bharu, located in the capital city of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, where the many valuable vernacular houses are preserved. According to the author\u2019s precedent studies (Ju et al, 2012), there are a variety of Malay housing typologies such as vernacular houses of Kampong Bharu can be classified into the traditional vernacular house I (Bumbung Panjang style), the traditional vernacular house II (Bumbung Perak style), the colonial vernacular house, and the modern vernacular house. In this study, we focus on classification of the modern vernacular houses in Kampong Bharu, respect with space organization and elevation design. Based on the analysis of the modern vernacular houses, this paper aims to describe the unique principle of modifying process of vernacular houses in Malaysia. Derived from the process in which vernacular houses change with the influence of modernization, the modern vernacular house in Kampong Bharu is most of which were built in the 1940s to 1960s. As a consequence of research, Modern vernacular houses actively reflected the influence of modernization in the use of structure and building materials, but have maintained the traditional character in terms of spatial organization and elevation.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2244729854"}}

Besides, according to the previous studies, most studies are about residential satisfaction that affects at the early stage of purchase and the real fact is that studies to maintain residential satisfaction are not sufficient. Therefore, the study is aimed at studying methods for maintenance of apartment housing for sustainable and efficient residential satisfaction improvement through residential satisfaction and maintenance of apartment housing. As for factors of maintenance deeply related to residential satisfaction, a large classification system was drawn up such as functional Aspect, convenient and comfortable aspect, safety aspect and after a medium classification of them into exclusive area and public area, the factors of maintenance for improvement of residential satisfaction were classified again.

In contemporary times, \"environmental designers\" need to consider both exterior and interior aspects because of the growing trend in dissolution between exterior and interior spaces. To quantify \"spatial sense\" which serves as the standard for environmental design, this study has asked 63 subjects to evaluate 15 interior and 14 exterior spaces. The \"spaciousness (small-large)\", \"openness(closed-open)\", \"warmness(warm-cold)\", \"brightness(bright-dark)\", \"softness(soft-hard)\", \"spatial intimacy\" and \"frequency of visit\" were adopted as variables of spatial sense. Through the analysis of these variables, this study could gain the difference between spatial sense for exterior and interior environments, quantify the spatial sense that physically and psychologically appropriates to human beings. The result of this study can be summarized as follows: Twice the amount of spaciousness was observed between the interior and exterior spaces. And the standard on intimate space is established with W/H ratio of 5.71 and high Window/Wall Area ratio in the interior and an area of 3,800m2 and a W/H ratio of 5.57 in exterior. The difference between the spatial sense in the interior and exterior space is mostly dependent on the psychological sense. The increase of physical size caused by the interior space to be perceived as cold, dark and hard psychologically, but exterior space to be perceived as warm, bright and soft. Psychological senses, especially softness, affect spatial intimacy to the greatest extent among the given variables. As the psychological senses for interior spaces were largely independent from the given space's size and perceptive senses, the size of the interior space, which exhibited spatial intimacy, could not be deduced. In comparison to this, due to the high dependency between the psychological senses for exterior spaces and the given space's size and perceptive senses. The study also showed that interior and exterior spaces have relatively different spatial sense and physical standards. Such research results are predicted to provide applicable standards for environmental designers for exterior and interior spaces in the future.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1971140527"}}

These relations are linking points among different architectural styles; each style has a strategy in dealing with these elements and relations. The strategy of dealing with those variables are the genetic tape that contains several codes, each of which donates relation shape. The varieties of these relations lead to a variation in building types and architectural styles. This variation in the structure of the code (the relations) depends on several environmental, social and geographical factors\u2026etc. The building types that could be much affected by those factors is the traditional house. The traditional Ottoman\u2019sstyle house has been chosen in this study; as through previous studies conducted that there are some important points about the house and its shape . Most of the previous studies tackled only one specified term, other studies focused on the geometric principles to create traditional shape , and there is a co-genetic relations among the traditional houses.

The design approaches of new exterior additions to historic buildings have been among the ongoing debates in the field of architectural conservation. The aim of this study is to develop an assessment method, which can be used to determine the compatibility in architectural expression of the new addition in relation to the characteristics of a historic building. This method is based on the architectural analysis, which includes environmental relations, building-lot relations, mass relations and the facade composition of the historic building both before and after the new addition in relation to the value of a historical building. In this study, a selected group of historic buildings in \u0130zmir, Turkey with new exterior additions was analysed with regard to their exterior architectural characteristics in order to evaluate the compatibility of the new addition, by employing the use of contemporary conservation principles. The importance of this study is to guide architects to form the basis of a decision for developing an integrated approach in designing new additions in the course of the actual design process. On the other hand, the proposed method can be evaluated as a contribution to the emerging field of heritage impact assessments as well as scientific assistance to local governments to criticize specific projects of cultural heritage assets submitted for appraisal. Analysis results showed that the value of the historic building should first clearly be identified and a new addition should bear the identity of its own period. However, instead of altering the scale or form of the historic building, a new addition should complement and contribute to the sense of proportion, disposition and historical pattern.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1971575112"}}

Though Korea and China have a lot of things in common, these two countries have developed different housing style. However, after modernization, apartments have become major housing style in both Korea and China. So this research analyzed 240 apartment plans which was build in Seoul and Beijing in 2000s and 2010s to predict the future trends for apartments. The results are as follows: The opening direction of the front door will be outwards as the hallway space of small apartments in China become wider as the living standards is increasing. Because of the floor sitting lifestyle, Koreans end outdoor activities when take off their shoes at the entrance hall and continue for indoor activities, they separate entrance hall from livingroom. However, because Chinese have chair sitting lifestyle, entrance hall and livingroom is not divided. Korean apartment shows a trend which connects livingroom, diningroom and kitchen altogether; however, Chinese apartment shows a trend which separates kitchen from livingroom and diningroom. Bedrooms are showing a trend of distributed layout. Master bedroom are showing a trend which includes separate bathroom or attached room as the size of apartment increases and so on.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1591126117"}}

While various complex housing plans have been introduced to our country recently, block housing besides flat-typed, tower-typed apartments is being appeared at several dwelling sites by way of showing examples. Block housing has structures like \u3134, \u3137, and \u3141 forms differently from standard apartments, and thus facilities including bench, pond, and playground etc of each apartment are arranged to its center as architectural characteristics. However, researches having analyzed which influences were affected to social activities of residents and sense of community by the block setting have never been made empirically till now. Therefore, this study tried to analyze what kind of influences were affected to social activities of residents and their senses of community actually after selecting Eunpyeong New Town as an object. As a result of this analysis, various social activities were observed at outer spaces of block housing more than standard apartments, and activity frequencies were appeared as being higher than standard apartments. According to a questionnaire, average scores on social activities, sense of community at block housing were higher than standard apartments by 0.53 and 0.39 score respectively. Also, social activities were shown as significantly affecting to the sense of community statistically as the result of using regression analysis, and thus the study considers its positive results such like social activities of residents would be enlarged and their senses of community could be enhanced accordingly through block housing plans.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1636871147"}}

The government introduced the urban life housing system on May 4, 2009 in order to activate the supply of small-sized housing, but there has been much concern with the possibility that the quality of life of residents will decrease in many cases where completed urban life houses lack convenience facilities and infrastructure in the surroundings. This study thus set out to compare the cases of urban life housing in South Korea with those of share housing in Japan and propose directions for the development of urban life housing with the advantages of share housing added. Previous studies were examined to review single-person households and urban life housing and understand the concepts and characteristics of share housing. Then the cases of urban life housing in the nation were compared and analyzed with those of share housing in Japan to figure out directions for developing urban life housing fit for single-person households. The subjects were two urban life houses that were located in Seodaemun-gu, had public space, and were completed within a year in the nation, as well as two collections of Rebita, a Japanese share housing company, in Tokyo. Those cases were examined for the month of August, 2012. As a result, the share housing cases of Japan were using public space in more active forms than the urban life housing of South Korea and organized public space with various leisure and cultural features incorporated in it. Meanwhile, the South Korean cases had a more high-grade image than the Japanese cases. Considering the small sample size of the study and the resulting limitations, it is required to compare and analyze more cases in future and study a model to develop urban life housing.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1908525746"}}

This study found out the change of spacial form of detached house in Korea on a 10-year basis from 1980s though analysis on the architecture of each period. For the subject houses of this study, the detached houses introduced repeatedly as excellent cases in technical journals for architecture were collected among those completed by architects who designed numerous houses and a survey was conducted on 18 detached houses of 18 architects among the in urban style houses in Seoul and suburban style houses in the suburbs of Seoul. Through this study, it could be found that, as the morphological application of traditional architecture was settled with spatial concept, the external spatial form of the detached houses in Korea after 1980s was changed to westernized form but the internal spacial form had been continuously changing suitable to our emotion by reflecting the living habit and taste with the traditional attitude to perceive and accept the nature. As for the change in the forms of interior space, vertical space with more than two floors became common. Front porch and stair hall, which were located at the center of a house and became an important spacial element that overlapped family\u2019s moving line, changed to open and bright space that used transparent glass and increased the space to contact the open air, reflecting our living habit and taste that preferred the feeling of internal openness. A Private space, main room, was more segmented and luxurious, and a public space, living room, secured the independency by getting close to symbolic yard. As for the change in the form of exterior space, the form of facade window has been changing in its location and size and brought free images due to the advancement of technology and material.

The purposes of this study were to reevaluate urban traditional houses and to propose direction for the conservation and utilization of urban traditional houses in a way of maintaining historical landscape rather than the value of urban traditional houses as components in expanded urban structure. For these purposes, we identified the characteristics of conservation and utilization of urban traditional houses by representative cases and analyzing them exhaustively, and suggested problems in the cinservation and utilization of traditional houses and solution for them. The current conservation system for Urban Traditional House in the Bukchon area is applied to non-residential Urban Traditional House differently according to the owner\u2019s consciousness of conservation because there is no support system for non-residential Urban Traditional House. Accordingly, there should be standardized criteria to maintain the landscape of the Bukchon area in terms of beauty formed by the elevation of Urban Traditional House and the continuity of roofs while accommodating various functions. As in total conservation or partial conservation, the interior remodeling of individual houses may be allowed but the three-dimensional external appearance composed of the outer walls, fences and roofs of Korean-style houses should be repaired and improved in a way of maintaining the image. In order to utilize Urban Traditional House in the Bukchon area, plans should be made in consideration of its location, historicity and tradition. We may expect the utilization of traditional cultural facilities and their surrounding areas as alternative cultural spaces. Such use of individual Urban Traditional House should be extended by linearly and areally and suggest the direction of conservation and utilization.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1930067809"}}

This study is based on a comparative method using a questionnaire by more than 682 housewives living in apartment complexes. Residents of apartment buildings are generally satisfied with housing and management of the apartment building that they are currently living in, but they wanted improvements such as programs that can support community living and increase participation of residents and operation of a web site. Furthermore, it was found that there was a significant difference in terms of operation management, such as sanitation control and processing for apartment buildings and community life management, according to the characteristics of the resident.

Unlike a complex-centered large residential area redeveloped into an apartment, in some city centered residential areas in Gangnam where Seoul apartment speculations had been further heated before and after 2000 a number of housing were formed which had been reconstructed into small multi-family villas on the ground just by increasing stories only after private houses had been demolished. Thanks to rising housing prices in Gangnam the mushrooming of small villas has risen, is transformed into a revenue type multifamily housing, and sold. Here looking at the construction status of that time, there were many cases that most of the homeowners needed to invest the fund loaned as a bank collateral in new building constructions. Accordingly as they have rushed to raise ROI(return on investment) they have come to completing the building at low-budget as soon as possible rather than the space planning considering forms and designs appropriate to the ground in new building construction planning. Recently as apartment chartered prices have soared and chartered housing problems have aggravated the population is increasing that want to buy and renovate such a small villa. Changes in our housing market that are constantly fluctuating as dwelling is not a space for living, but utilized as a tool of investment techniques require reasonable flat alternatives and design enhancing at any dimension in terms of preventing increasing economic losses due to house repairing work in the future or in order to provide people to have to renovate with small capital more livable space.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1958314768"}}

This study investigates the modernization process of the government managing housing in Korea from 1910 to the early 1970\u2019s based on the discourse of Le Corbusiers taylorization, which presumes standardization and industrialization. Through the case study, we found a tendency of standardization and industrialization of building components in Korean modern housing based on the separation of themselves, for example from a united wall to a separated column, interior material, covering. Spatial taylorization can also be recognized based on the achievement of relatively open plan due to the change of structure system. Standardization of space is recognized in two ways. One is to add standardized spatial units to compose a house. The other is to divide a standardized big space to form a house. Meanwhile, open-ended system and closed system, the two typical construction methods of the modern architecture, were both developed but especially in the construction of houses the closed system settled successfully compared to the open-ended system due to the support of government. Above-mentioned features of Government Managing Housing in Korea shared common characteristics with Western Modern Architecture but also had unique features.

In the Korean traditional houses, there are variable plan type like straight rectangular shape (some people calls Chinese letter\u4e00shape) and Korean letter\u3131shape, \u3137shape & \u3141 shape, etc If the main building is straight rectangular shape, the kitchen is placed next the main room. But, in the others the kitchen is located in side or front. This study is based on the ideas why the kitchen is located on different place. It was found that there are three types(straight, parallel and special type) in the main buildings of Yang-dong folk village. The kitchen of straight type is bigger than main room, but the parallel type is opposite. The reason why the size is different is the main room is to be opened onto the yard for the straight type and in the other case, the kitchen is as well For the straight type, the size of building is comparatively small and closed but, the ground ia able to used more sffectively.

Therefore, it cludes urban properties and understand itself as a urban-architecture responds modernistic situation and conditions. The temporary occupancy which has less time-layers relatively signifies the point that establishes exchangeable-relationship between the city and the architecture instead of disconnected and isolated relationship.

The government introduced the urban life housing system on May 4, 2009 in order to activate the supply of small-sized housing, but there has been much concern with the possibility that the quality of life of residents will decrease in many cases where completed urban life houses lack convenience facilities and infrastructure in the surroundings. This study thus set out to compare the cases of urban life housing in South Korea with those of share housing in Japan and propose directions for the development of urban life housing with the advantages of share housing added. Previous studies were examined to review single-person households and urban life housing and understand the concepts and characteristics of share housing. Then the cases of urban life housing in the nation were compared and analyzed with those of share housing in Japan to figure out directions for developing urban life housing fit for single-person households. The subjects were two urban life houses that were located in Seodaemun-gu, had public space, and were completed within a year in the nation, as well as two collections of Rebita, a Japanese share housing company, in Tokyo. Those cases were examined for the month of August, 2012. As a result, the share housing cases of Japan were using public space in more active forms than the urban life housing of South Korea and organized public space with various leisure and cultural features incorporated in it. Meanwhile, the South Korean cases had a more high-grade image than the Japanese cases. Considering the small sample size of the study and the resulting limitations, it is required to compare and analyze more cases in future and study a model to develop urban life housing.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2932550002"}}

Though Korea and China have a lot of things in common, these two countries have developed different housing style. However, after modernization, apartments have become major housing style in both Korea and China. So this research analyzed 240 apartment plans which was build in Seoul and Beijing in 2000s and 2010s to predict the future trends for apartments. The results are as follows: The opening direction of the front door will be outwards as the hallway space of small apartments in China become wider as the living standards is increasing. Because of the floor sitting lifestyle, Koreans end outdoor activities when take off their shoes at the entrance hall and continue for indoor activities, they separate entrance hall from livingroom. However, because Chinese have chair sitting lifestyle, entrance hall and livingroom is not divided. Korean apartment shows a trend which connects livingroom, diningroom and kitchen altogether; however, Chinese apartment shows a trend which separates kitchen from livingroom and diningroom. Bedrooms are showing a trend of distributed layout. Master bedroom are showing a trend which includes separate bathroom or attached room as the size of apartment increases and so on.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2942744175"}}

While various complex housing plans have been introduced to our country recently, block housing besides flat-typed, tower-typed apartments is being appeared at several dwelling sites by way of showing examples. Block housing has structures like \u3134, \u3137, and \u3141 forms differently from standard apartments, and thus facilities including bench, pond, and playground etc of each apartment are arranged to its center as architectural characteristics. However, researches having analyzed which influences were affected to social activities of residents and sense of community by the block setting have never been made empirically till now. Therefore, this study tried to analyze what kind of influences were affected to social activities of residents and their senses of community actually after selecting Eunpyeong New Town as an object. As a result of this analysis, various social activities were observed at outer spaces of block housing more than standard apartments, and activity frequencies were appeared as being higher than standard apartments. According to a questionnaire, average scores on social activities, sense of community at block housing were higher than standard apartments by 0.53 and 0.39 score respectively. Also, social activities were shown as significantly affecting to the sense of community statistically as the result of using regression analysis, and thus the study considers its positive results such like social activities of residents would be enlarged and their senses of community could be enhanced accordingly through block housing plans.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2951184988"}}

In the Korean traditional houses, there are variable plan type like straight rectangular shape (some people calls Chinese letter\u4e00shape) and Korean letter\u3131shape, \u3137shape & \u3141 shape, etc If the main building is straight rectangular shape, the kitchen is placed next the main room. But, in the others the kitchen is located in side or front. This study is based on the ideas why the kitchen is located on different place. It was found that there are three types(straight, parallel and special type) in the main buildings of Yang-dong folk village. The kitchen of straight type is bigger than main room, but the parallel type is opposite. The reason why the size is different is the main room is to be opened onto the yard for the straight type and in the other case, the kitchen is as well For the straight type, the size of building is comparatively small and closed but, the ground ia able to used more sffectively. For the parallel type, the big yard, home extensions and better residential environment are available To make the building like this style, in Yangdong village the shaped \u3131 buildings have the different height of the dori that meet in the corner pillar.

Housing and its architectural characteristics physically change in step with changes in culture, social demographics, behavior and environmental structures. These physical changes influence the environment and housing because of contemporary life-styles and behaviors. The cultural identity which has been created in a long period of time is going to be lost rapidly. Cultural changes also include migration. The migration from rural areas to the downtowns causes variety in traditions and the architectural spaces. The cultural environment consists of such elements, each are affecting the evolution of the culture. These are religion, belief systems, ecology, economy and the social aspects like family structures, and cultural interaction. Vernacular architecture is a manifestation, a physical representation of the culture of a people. Malatya-Battalgazi which is the oldest habitation area in Anatolia is among the downtowns that losing its cultural identity. The civil architecture in the town has suffered but the religious architecture is nearly conserved related with the beliefs. The history of Battalgazi, which is called as Old Malatya till to 1988, goes to ancient times. The first habitation of Malatya is the artificial hill called Aslantepe in the boundary of village BahA\u00a7ebaA\u00beA\u00bd. Strabon, the ancient times geographer, called Malatya as Melitene. Town cannot betray its identity in nowadays. The lack of preservation consciousness, changes in the culture and searching the contemporary life style comfort in the new built environment cause deterioration on the built environment. The cultural identities are going to be disappeared in front of globalization.

One of them is Poyrazlar House which shows the characteristics of vernacular houses that oriented with two storeys due to the bigness of the patriarchal family.

In the upper-floor there are the recess, living room and bed room, in ground-floor; the kitchen, toilet and the stable. The recess was used as the connection space of the rooms in the upper floor.

For that reason, there was a limit to improve social problem of urban area behind hosing complex and surrounding area. Because government propel to make brand of city, have parking facilities and rise floor space index rather than established reproduction plan based on the aging problem of housing complex. Therefore, city need to deduct major reproduction issue to improve aging problem and prepare effective counterplan in complex and surround area by reproduction. This study progress through three steps of research. First, arrange problem of aging complex and way of response sustainably.

The structure of Russian chandeliers of classicism, which featured ancient motives, has not gained so far academic consideration. They were studied in terms of their conforming to the classical style of interior.\u00a0We concluded that chandeliers influenced the traditional Russian forms of church chandeliers, as well as development of French decorators, who are constantly studying Russian masters. The main aim of the research is to prove that the three-dimensional solution of lights of the time of Catherine theGreat was based on antique grotesque. The chandeliers featured the latest achievements of Russian glass industry, with stained glass being used for manufacturing of lamps in Russian. All these factors led to the emergence of magnificent chandeliers of the original design. At first the construction was developed by master craftsmen, who managed to find a completely new solution to the forms of decorative art, and later well-known architects developed the design of chandeliers.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2604282845"}}

This paper studies the sustainable design and cultural elements that are found in the traditional Minangkabau house in Western Sumatera, Indonesia and in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.

The architecture is known to be laced heavily with cultural values, customs and rituals and reflects the people\u2019s understanding about designing architecture that is in harmony with nature. The house serves as a residence, a hall for family meetings, and for ceremonial activities. With the Minangkabau society being matrilineal, the house is owned by the women of the family who live there \u2013 ownership is passed from mother to daughter. The houses have dramatic curved roof structures with multi-tiered, upswept gables to mimic the horn of the buffalo. The objectives of this research are to analyse the matriarchal influence on the architecture; to investigate the architecture in terms of its sustainability issues as well as the traditional philosophy and cultural issues associated with the architecture. The methodology employed for this research includes reviewing the existing literature on the house to enable understanding of the space planning of the house. Other literature looks into cultural issues that comprise customs and traditions relating to the house supported by the field research in the Minangkabau villages in Malaysia and Western Sumatera. This is done simultaneously with the interview process of the locals and the visual data collection of the architecture. Architecturally, the house transpires that the dwelling-house is represented in the forms of space visualising the dwellers\u2019 culture. This research will ultimately venture into the understanding of the sustainability issues found in the design of the house and the sustainability of cultural beliefs applied in the rituals associated with the architecture.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1993078050"}}

The advent of factory building as a construction task in the 19th century was an international phenomenon and soon determined the silhouette of whole cities and landscapes. An understanding of historic factory buildings cannot be obtained solely through the visual approach - albeit these buildings often have their own aesthetic qualities and make a strong graphic expression. In Budapest, it was mainly the food and engineering industries that shaped industrial development in the period under investigation. Identifying the complex factors that led to the construction of this type of building is the first step towards gaining an understanding of such architecture. Technical innovations, new forms of factory organisation, and novel developments in the production process exerted a formative influence on the internal layout of these buildings. The manner in which power was transmitted also served to determine building structures. It should be noted that a factory is established through the combination of machinery and an organised flow of production. At the turn of the century, American models of factory organisation exerted the primary influence on the construction of factories in Europe. At the same time, the transition from traditional craft industries to modern modes of industrial production also resulted in the development of new types of buildings.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2072763784"}}

Due to its own configuration, space can manifest various characteristics and also cause specific behavior. Shared space is a semi-public/private space, which is located roughly in between public and private space. In other words, it contains the closed part of public area and open part of private section. From the emotional point of view, this space is capable of healing mental disease of the lonely moderns by the intimate relationship among humans, connection each other, and communication. This space is divided into \u2018territoriality\u2019, \u2018accessability\u2019, and \u2018functionality\u2019 based on its function. It is also summarized by categorizing it into friendly relation, openness, and humanity based on its emotional point. Moreover, this space has a point of contact with the expression of modern community. Being obscure among boundaries of modern communities is very similar to the point that the boundaries are ambiguous as the shared space is laid across both public and private section. Moreover, that the shared space is developed in a type of network can be compared with the characteristics of the shared space to make connection with humans. Open and public characteristics have the similar direction with what this space is pursuing. Based on these characteristics, the amenity plan was applied as an activation plan for the community. Especially, constructional amenity plan is progressed focusing on convenience, nature-friendliness, esthetic appreciation, and culture. Amenity plan, which applies landscape architecture, means comprehensive comfortableness of the environment after all, and also a paradigm which can improve the quality of space. Moreover, physical environments and programs for environmental improvement and community activation are capable of building a community infrastructure. Like the architectural amenity plan, the shared space can also lead the characteristics of the public space to the private space, which forms inter-relationship with intimacy. Thus it is highly probable that the community can be activated in the space.

The main entrance of apartment building performs not only function of connection between indoor and outdoor but also interaction with neighbors as a semi-public space. This study aims to find out the residential preference for the main entrance design factors of apartment buildings and analyze design characteristics through time series study and new towns in Korea. the research methods are as follow. First, the main entrance design factors was derived from other studies for analyzing status of the main entrance of new towns such as Bundang and Dontan. Second, comparative analysis was performed between Bundang and Dongtan New Towns on those factors. Third, residential preference survey was performed for configuring the design direction on the apartment building main entrance. In conclusion, the mixed-type among main entrance design types that makes piloti space and distinguished facade design should be considered as one of the primary planning types of apartment building entrance. Second, residents prefer community space in the main entrance such as a piloti, Lobby and some places for relaxation.

This study finds out the traditional aspects at the building appearance of Janpanese contemporary architecture in the 20th century. The most-used subject as the motive was a roof, which occupies 36% out of the all examples found. In cases using the overall figures of the body, 2 motives are found; Chasitzu motive 27%, and the mixed-up motive12% that shows several elements. The mixed-up motive derives their compromise from the roof, wall and base-platform of Shrine and Buddhist temple, ware house, and private house. The wall motive occupies 15%.In the rest, theres the one expresses Japanese line applying Isigaki. This example occupied 3 %. Also there was the one adopts the formation laying over a bundle of rice straws of a reaping machine, 3% occupied. And the last case, occupies 3% also, was found to be built with a purpose to easily confront Japanese traditional esthetic, UGEN alongside the nature using light materials. In a situation with the all body put together comprimisingly or with a single style applied precisely, the old style was transformed into modern style simplifying the form and the decoration to a concise line or surface. And this case features that the material used is just modernistic. On the other hand, quoting a one point as a motive the architect exposed the pattern that repeats equal details or the pattern displays contrast details. On age table, until 1930s architects mainly focused on copying from traditional style and blending into expressions based on the overall shape of the various roofs. After that, several style had appeared till the late 70s which included whole body-summarized style and part-summarized-to-mix style. From the late 50s, Japanese traditional architecture was sectionally adopted to modernism buildings and after 70s the symbolic expression come up with simplification of line and surface as well as modernization of the material. As conventional esthetic was re-analyzed symbolic figures using metaphor started to be found after 80s, which indicates that trend went with the European Neo-rationalism. As the aspect of function of buildings, the monumental public space in large scale or performance space possesses roof-motive. Specifically Gabuki theater, where the Japanese traditional act performed all, showed the motives from roofs of Shrine and Castle. Facilities related to living were contructed mostly using neo-sukiya style, partly applying roof, wall, traditional esthetic points.

The methodology included surveying and documenting the existing structure; examining old materials and methods of construction, earlier repairs and the suitability of matching new materials; analysing the structure, defects and their causes; prescribing remedial measures; preparing items of work, estimating and tendering for appointment of contractors; allocating funds for restoration; supervision and monitoring of the works. Findings It was necessary to undertake structural strengthening and physical restoration through corrective measures, and reinstallation of all service systems, which resulted in the opening up of this edifice again for various kinds of public use, that included a museum. Social implications This was a pilot project for the state administration and the people of Kolkata. After this project, the conservation of historic buildings became an agenda of government and civil society. The lessons learned here were applied to the restoration of other similar buildings in Kolkata. Originality/value Conservation\u2010researchers, academics and practitioners will gain from this paper an in\u2010depth understanding of the restoration process in Kolkata.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2015943704"}}

Shortage of housing and the growth of increasing demand of it are often considered as the essential problem in the developing countries. The studies indicate the issue is truly correct about Iran. The factors which always cause the problem of shortage of housing that the main and important of which in Iran are: the growth of population, need for renovation of old settings, inappropriate and imperfect current building industry and destruction by natural factors such as earthquake. All of these factors result in the considerable growth of housing demand. In this condition, mass production of housing in order to acceleration of building construction is necessitated. One of the difficulties involving mass production is not using of indigenous patterns in constructing process. The goal of this research is using of indigenous patterns in mass production and industrial housing and also replying to the question of how you can use the indigenous patterns in industrial architecture. Odlajan district of Tehran has been selected as case study. The typology of the existing housing extracted. Then selective patterns for industrial construction are offered.

Looking from an historical perspective, it can be seen that many civilizations have lived in the country and consequently produced many different cultures and architectural products. One of the oldest cities which contain such historical examples which have lived until present is Tabriz. Its traditional houses are the most important places to represent the life style of the past. Lack of recognition and appreciation of these buildings by authorities and the public will gradually lead to their destruction and replacement by contemporary buildings. The present study seeks to introduce specific architectural features of traditional houses in Tabriz. Preservation of the features of these houses helps maintain the architectural heritage and culture of the region. Most old houses in Tabriz were reconstructed at the beginning of the Qajar era after a devastating earthquake in 1780. The destruction caused by contemporary constructions, in the chaos of modern period, makes it difficult for researchers to gather information about the principles of traditional buildings and to identify their typology. The survey is a compilation of a process in the typology of 52 traditional houses of Qajar and Pahlavi periods in Tabriz. The study revealed that it is possible to accomplish the classification of the monuments with the application of a quantification process in which the qualitative data related to architectural elements was successfully converted into quantitative data by assigning numerical values and using coefficients.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2280220846"}}

The purpose of this study was to identify the planning characteristics of openness and area effectiveness of high-rise residential buildings in terms of building forms. 9 high-rise residential buildings in Korea higher than 60-stories were selected to represent the building plan types- square type, X-type, Y-type, and the irregular. The openness of each case was analyzed primarily in terms of the length of exterior surface and the number of facing direction. The results of this study were as follows; while square type building plan is proper for the typical floors of relatively small and midium sizes due to the limitation of depth from exterior surface to core, X-type and Y-type building plan can provide much more length of exterior surface for openness of larger typical floor. However, the area effectiveness rapidly decreases for the large X-type than Y-type building plan. Therefore, more serious consideration need to be exerted for the core and unit plan of large size high-rise residential buildings to secure the effectiveness of typical plan but also for livability of each unit.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1835563186"}}

But there are problems by hindrance of skyline formation and height of buildings. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to suggest the height standard and the slenderness ratio to location types of Mixed-use Residential Tall buildings. For the method of the study, term arrangement through literature search and the precedent research survey were first done, the level of urban design and the details related to the height of buildings were done as the case research focusing on the 16 cases in Seoul. The following results were drawn by suggesting the height standard and the slenderness ratio by location type based on them. First, the height of mixed-use building by location type in the level of urban design gets higher starting from the secondary center of the city and can be suggested as from less than 150m to more than 200m. Second, the slenderness ratio shall be planned as more than 1:3 because the area of the ground level of mixed-use building is large unlike Mixed-use Residential Tall buildings and visual passage shall be placed so that unity of openness and group formation will be planned. Third, for the height related to Mixed-use Residential Tall buildings, amendment of the special architectural district system and the special law related to super high-rise buildings shall be enacted.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2029091704"}}

Shifting of university campus to its present location on University Road in 1975 led to the abandonment of this historic site for more than twenty years; adversely affecting the structures due to neglect and disuse. In 1997 NED City Campus was declared as a listed heritage of Karachi given protection under the Sindh Cultural Heritage Preservation Act 1994. In 2000, realizing its importance as an invaluable asset the NED university\u2019s Department of Architecture and Planning conceptualized the vision for restoring this campus and putting it to use; not only on grounds of its historic significance but also for reasons of sustainability, environmental enhancement and regeneration of historic fabric. Restoration of NED City Campus is envisioned with an approach of minimal interventions and respect to the original setting, layout and materials of construction; closely following the international principles of heritage conservation. The approach is to achieve optimum utilization of campus premises primarily as an educational hub; but additionally introducing a variety of ancillary activities to facilitate extended usage of the property.

Over time, urban growth resulted in the settlement losing its agricultural value and now it is a unique preserved housing area for Malays. Many vernacular Malay houses that were built in the 1900s still exist in KB. These houses were not original vernacular houses and were transformed and modernized into unique typologies that lie between the traditional and modern typologies.This study defines these houses as 'modern' vernacular Malay houses and attempts to explore the typologies of such houses built during the 1900s in KB. More than 100 vernacular Malay houses in KB were investigated and analyzed with respect to three major elements of order of the traditional Malay house elevation: roof, wall and pillar. As a result of this study, several representative 'modern' vernacular typologies were proposed. It is important to document these typologies because they demonstrate how traditional vernacular Malay houses were transformed into modern houses through the modernization process.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W403415176"}}

As a standard to recognize the commonness and uniqueness among East Asian housing culture, this paper compares the sense of boundary between inside and outside space among traditional residence in Korea, China, and Japan. The purpose of this paper is to extract the spatial characteristics supporting its own vernacular system and to analyze the tendency how to perceive the space and the boundary in a different way. As a case study, the following housing types are selected and analyzed; Houses of \u2018Sadaebuga(\u58eb\u5927\u592b\u5bb6)\u2019 in Joseon dynasty of Korea, \u2018Shoin-style House(\u66f8\u9662\u9020)\u2019 in the period of Edo in Japan and \u2018Siheyuan(\u56db\u5408\u9662)\u2019 in the Chiang period of China. To deal with the issue of inside and outside space, semi-void space which has the intermediate functions is critical in terms of defining the boundary of spatial compositions. Each representative precedent in three countries has particular semi-void space in the diverse of shape and size. Semi-void space provides the clue to trace the way how to people perceive the sense of boundary in the middle of solid and void groups. The sizes, the positions and the functions of the semi-void space integrate overall spatial atmosphere according to the genetic prototypes that each case has developed. Each three housing type shows various degree of visual privacy and enclosure, overlapping view and interlocking spatial experience. Unspecified or blurred boundary severed to generate various visual connections determines the perceives size, and the number of overlapped layer in space. Accordingly, this study precedently review the meaning of inside and outside in the east Asia residence and analyze space attribute in the idea of boundary crossed in the residence of three counties. These analysis is focused on extracting inherent pattern at boundary crossed and duplicated in the residence, where inside space and outside space have different layout and different size in the example.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1912871121"}}

Abstract Balinese traditional home is one of traditional architectures in Indonesia in which it still survives up to now. The home as a part of Balinese Traditional Architecture derives from Balinese Hindu belief and their custom which have a lot of Hindu philosophy. Base on this philosophy, the house which is created as a model of human being and a model divine of macro cosmos. The aim of this is to create harmony between micro cosmos (human being) and macro cosmos (nature). Physically, the usage of body measurements in the whole building dimensions has approved of how the implementation of a model of human being is created. Another thing is of how to abstractly create the building to have a soul through using basic dimension, mantra, and ritual for permission to the holy and devil spirit. Because of this, the building becomes a really unique thing.However, an interesting question reveals in relation to green building i.e. how does a Balinese traditional home create a comfortable internal environment without resorting energy usage? The presented paper has addressed it which is approached from the building layout to the building components. From those, the home appears that it has fully accounted to respond a warm-humid zone of the tropical climate. And a comfortable internal environment can be reached maximally through the use of open air concept or courtyard pattern in the building composition, most open and small buildings, the use of non bearing wall and also the critical point is the use of natural materials with low heat storage and large air cavity. Therefore, this means that the Balinese home has performed itself as a green building.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2252961443"}}

The main stream of research on traditional built form can be assumed to be focused on either cultural or natural deterministic approaches. Although the priority depends largely on the background of the scholar; culture and nature are mostly accepted to be the major factor determining the course of evaluation of traditional built form. Other forces acting on the formation of traditional built environments, ranging from defensive to administrative factors have also been issues of the discussion in scholar works. An important aspect of traditional built form, besides the constraints imposed and opportunities offered by the above forces, is the existence of discernible interdependences between the individual house form and settlement pattern. Neither the house nor the settlement evolves irrespective of one another. Individual houses are integral components of the settlements they belong to. Furthermore, no single house can be viewed as a self-sufficient building standing all by itself in the natural landscape. Isolated traditional buildings, like farm houses, are rare and exceptional. Similarly traditional settlements cannot be taken up as additive assemblies of individual masses. Space configuration of indoors and outdoors and also the modes of interaction between the two are shaped totally according to the aforementioned mutual dependence. Solid-void relationship that characterizes the textural properties of the settlement pattern, modes of enclosure and exposure, are all defined by the layout relations among the building masses.

Abstract For the past fifty years, apartments have become the inevitable standard of housing types while over 9\u00a0million apartments have been produced through industrialization and urbanization of Korea. The society is now challenged to change its paradigm in housing provision to actualize symbiotic community among people and with eco system, adaptable as both a welfare and green infra space. In this context, currently, an innovative building model with shared spare space as a strategic idea to cope with various social problems and future ecological risks was suggested. The purpose of this research is to develop a building innovation model powerful enough to efficiently and effectively promote symbiotic community. An eclectic methodological approach was employed, using interview, questionnaire survey, web survey, professional group workshops, and multidisciplinary open discussion meetings. As results, the suggested model with shared community space as its critical concept was well accepted by all stakeholders. The feasibility and value of the building innovation model was confirmed as an intervention to promote symbiotic community of Korea in an efficient way. The results have great implication for building improvement of other industrial countries with fast mass housing to cope with world energy issues and social exclusion issues.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2084990493"}}

The Malay vernacular houses are inextricably intertwined with vernacular values embracing a natural harmony between architecture, people and environment. These vernacular values are comprised of socio-cultural and environmental concerns.

The environmental values are the spatial characteristics and locally environmental trends embodied in the functional spaces of Malay houses representing local characteristics of environment and tropic. Referring to the theoretical analysis, it is deduced that the aforementioned environmental and socio-cultural values are highly influential towards enhancing the quality of living environments inside the house leading to the enhancement of the quality of life as an expression of the degree of well-being.

Regenerated hanoks, Korean-style vernacular houses in Bukchon (North Village) of Seoul, have been celebrated as the successful examples of a hybrid dwelling integrating modern facilities in a traditional house form. While the modernization project during the postwar era encouraged South Koreans to live in high rise apartments, hanoks became one of the alternative residential options as urban forest of concrete high rises were perceived to be aesthetically unappealing as well as ecologically unsustainable. Hopes are high that remodeled hanoks can ameliorate not only dreary urban landscape but over-competitive and harsh everyday life conditions. While preservation guidelines for regenerated hanoks provide residents with a possible stylistic model, it becomes questionable whether they are viable solutions given the proliferation of structures which seemingly adhere to the guidelines without considering local urban context. By pointing out the difference between the preservation guideline and its real life manifestations, this paper illustrates how imagined aspect of the vernacular architecture takes precedence over the experiential aspect. In this process of selective appropriation, various vernacular housing types are flattened into a standardized representation of upper class dwellings.

This simple behavior has possibility to make lots of changes to the culture of architectural design. With this noticeable point, this paper is talking about the cultural feature of Korean traditional architecture, especially about the influence of tanking off and putting on shoes. The matter of shoes has changed diverse aspects of building and layout planning. It maximized the difference between front and rear part of building and characterized the lateral extension of Korean traditional house. The ritual space also had evolved from chair-sitting to floor-sitting space according to the type of ritual behavioral pattern. The change on the single building level had influenced on the layout planning of architectural complex.

We analyze openness of view and flexibility of spaces divided by the physical and architectural aspects as first component and the psychological and interior space aspects as second component. The results showed that Japanese small houses have various unit plan compared to uniformity of Korean houses. Openness of view in Japanese small housing is accomplished by letting in light from the outside using position and shape of the window, looking more spacious using courtyard, void spaces, or sliding door hanging from the ceiling, and creating deception of view using floor-wall plan and appropriate materials. Flexibility of spaces is achieved by combination of first and second components, multipurpose of space and furniture, and variety of storage methods.

In conclusion, the number of bays in the housing unit has gradually increased, after allowing for the structural change of the balcony in the legal. It is estimated that the trend has came from the intent to increase the numbers of the externally exposed surfaces of the balcony, ensure a good view, lighting, ventilation and spatial flexibility.

The historical space undergoes both natural destruction and creative transformation that reflects the needs and aims of contemporary people.  Due to the character of his profession an architect plays a vital role in analyzing the distant past and planning the future space. His technical knowledge allows him to understand the space structure and form, while the historical background \u2013 to locate the space against cultural and social events. The techniques used by a historian and an architecture researcher are very similar or even identical to an archaeologist\u2019s methodology. However, by the end of the research process an architect starts to design a completely new spatial phenomenon that makes use of the material culture elements from the past. His participation in both documentation stages gives an architect specific insight into research methods and technologies, designer\u2019s technical expectations, and documentation compatibility in both fields of study.  Architecture and archaeology can be very close fields thanks to the use of innovative technologies and digitalization in the measurement and documentation processes, provided, however, they present similar levels of technical mastery, make use of similar vocabulary of concepts (graphic, too) and compatible computer systems.  We do not want to deal here with the documentation technology shared by an archaeologist and an architect, but rather with the possibility of using and adapting the research knowledge in the newly designed space. It is not so difficult to structurally keep this knowledge in a historical monument or its relics. However, if on object or space has been completely destroyed, the question is how to show this knowledge, e.g. in a museum\u2019s program for visitors.  The Museum of the Second World War in Gdansk project is an excellent training ground at both stages: research (historical and archaeological) and design works. The Museum is to be located in the historic Gdansk Main Town, in less than 150 m distance from the limits of the medieval city (10-13th c.) and the Teutonic Knights\u2019 fortress (14-15th c.). Until 1945 this area of 17.000 m2 was known as Wiadrownia (germ. Eimermacherhof) housing district. At the end of the Second World War it was completely demolished and has never been reconstructed.  The historical and archaeological research conducted since 2011 has revealed a complex process of dynamic changes in natural systems of two rivers, as well as numerous time horizons of historic colonization. All spatial phenomena continuously and cyclically disappear. Sometimes only few relics of them are kept, and sometimes they can be read only through their negatives or spatial context signalling their presence. Like the shadow world of people, communities, and cultures \u2013 the world not so distant in time, but so characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe. The Museum of the Second World War in Gdansk is a daring project, not only with regard to its architectural design, but also to its internal structure and museum program that makes use of the most advanced concepts and technologies. The project aims determine the methods, techniques and organization of the archaeological research, as well as the methodology and scope of the documentation process. The Museum is planned to be opened on 1 September 2014 \u2013 the 75th anniversary of the war outbreak. Now the research and design teams are in the last stage of preparing the museum concept and program scenario that is going to be finished by September 2012.  In our paper we are going to present draft versions of the documentation and the museum exhibition regarding the location history rather than the global phenomenon of the Second World War.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2521294032"}}

Compositions of the both facade applied similar architectural elements, like pillars, projections, attics, plinth and also decorative elements that symbolizes the function of a building. Inner organization of space also corresponds to each other, in both buildings: beside offices there were several apartments for renting. In contrast to other bank buildings in Hungary designed by Juzsef Hubert, bank building in Subotica, although made according to the concept of Central Bank building in Budapest represents remarkable and unique architectural masterpiece including all: architectural composition, decorative elements and function of a building.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2288836342"}}

The authors of this paper refer to the problem of mansion formation in Siberia, which acts as a part of the basic planning element in the development of urban areas and is represented in a great variety. The article contains the retrospective analysis of architectural and planning formation of Siberian mansions. We consider three major periods, during which the active formation of the Siberian mansion occurred. The analysis contains the peculiarities of the basic structural and functional elements of the mansion (the configuration and size of the territory boundaries, the nature of the core location (the izba) and its types, forming the land adjacent to the building, etc.). The analysis of the given features is presented as a distinguishing characteristic of each period. Along with these features the attention is paid to the socio-cultural factors that determine the evolution of the mansions of Siberian region. In this paper it is shown that during the first period (the 17th the second half of the 19th cc.), which is characterized by dynamic urban development, the basic principles of similar houses layout on small-sized areas were forming. During the same period, owing to the work of the COMMISSION FOR ST. PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW STONE CONSTRUCTION, the tendency to arrange buildings and to plan settlements appears and constitutes a part of the legislative policy on urban development. In the period from the 17th century until the second half of the 19th century the development of urban mansions in Siberia takes place against the background of regular urban development in Russia. The normative legal requirements to architecture and city building is being formed. The exemplary design as the basis for urban development of any country settlement significantly contributed to the transformation of the internal organization of the Siberian mansion. Taking into account the new trends and general requirements one may say that the centric model of the Siberian mansion begins to change. The analysis of the third period (the second half of the 19th early 20th cc.) showed a decisive influence on the formation of the Siberian city mansion by different socio-cultural factors that contribute to both the intensive development of the urban population and house building. Among the important changes in the composition-planning model of the urban mansion of this period one can mark the inclusion of the commercial apartment building into the structure of the mansion, as well as increasing the number of different manufacturing facilities. Thus, the given retrospective analysis allows us to trace the timeline of changes in the structure of the Siberian city mansion, and classify them according to various criteria.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W129787334"}}

Some of the major components that determine the price of housing units are the price of land, building materials, labour and technology. In developing countries, the first and second components that affect the unit price of the building are building materials representing about 70% and skilled labour respectively (Ural, 1980). Based on this, a good strategy to adopt in order to minimize the price is to manipulate these two components.Based on a literature review and observation, this study will explain which aspects of building material technology can reduce the building cost and how it can maintain the identity of local architecture.The results of the study indicate that the building material can be created to both reduce cost and adopt traditional architecture style as an identity.

When attempting the recovery and reutilization of historic architecture, an in-depth knowledge of the artifact and its physical, environmental and historical context represents the first step required for its protection. Another important step is the choice of a methodology for transforming heterogeneous data into organized data. The aim of this research is to propose a method to construct a data map of the architectural heritage and the multidisciplinary aspects that qualify it (construction techniques and materials, material decay factors, signs of disastrous events in the past on buildings and the urban fabric, etc.). Thanks to the GIS environment it is possible to link together geometric, spatial and relational elements and then to develop quantitative and qualitative analyses based on spatial methods for typological and structural classification and to evaluate surfaces and structures. The design of the GIS architecture is fundamental, in order to contain data coming from different paths of knowledge acquisition (observed in loco or coming from documentary sources, derived from spatial analysis or instrumental investigations). In this way an important instrument for diagnostics, urban planning and conservation management can be created. The project is in its initial phase.

This research concentrates on the influence of the Dutch architect and mathematician Simon Stevin (1548-1620). Stevin's ideas on forts, town planning and buildings are laid down in treatises and have had a great influence on the construction of forts in the Netherlands and forts and outposts of the VOC/Dutch in Asia specifically in East Indies, India, Sri Lanka and Malaya (Melaka). The objectives of this research are: to study and clarify Dutch architectural principles to establish new towns (settlements) outside the Netherlands. Specifically in East Indies India, Sri Lanka, and Malaya (Melaka). To study the implementation of Dutch treatise principles on the fort and settlement of Melaka and to analyse whether Dutch principles were applied on the architecture of Dutch buildings in Melaka in particular on the design of the front facade. The methodology of the research is as follows: The first step was to inventorise what kind of literature would contribute and give a base to the study. The second step was to find material in archives which would support the study. The principles (treatises) of Simon Stevin (1548-1620) were looked into according to which Dutch settlements were designed and the implementation of these on settlements in Southeast Asia. Also documents were studied in which decisions were taken about Melaka concerning changes which were made on the town and the fort during the Dutch era. The third step was to make a general inventory of the public buildings and shop houses in the Core and Buffer Zone of Melaka. From this inventory 9 case studies emerged with regard to the public buildings, the fort and 37 with regard to the shop houses. The findings of this research are that Dutch architecture in Melaka, in the public buildings, shows an exactitude and symmetry in design. As can be seen in the symmetrically placed bays and windows. This study has classified 37 shop houses according to placement of doors and windows in the facade of the shop houses. The study has been conducted by determining architectural characteristics and elements that are essentially of Dutch origin.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1872282492"}}

Balinese traditional interior and architecture used to utilize natural materials such as stone, sand stone, and brick for the foundation and walls of a building, and its frame and roof used to be made of wood, bamboo, coconut leaves and ijuk (palm fiber from the sugar palm). The development in technology and design has made them impossible to be used for the interior parts and architecture of the building, due to the dusts they produce and their inability to endure. The development of technology and building materials has also made people choose other building materials such as concrete and plaster covered with wall paint. Wall paint is good enough for finishing the interior parts of the building. In addition, it is also good enough for finishing the outer parts of the building as it is dustless and endures the weather and is easily maintained. To enrich the treasury of final finishing, the warnabali, which used to be referred to as cat Bali (Bali paint) has been used in paintings, painting statues and arca (another type of statue) and masks. In addition, it has also been used with the architecture using wood as the material such as door ornaments, pillars and other ornaments. The warnabali is basically made of mangsi, taum, kencu, deluge, atal and bone. It consists of seven basic colors such as black, blue, red, jingga (colors ranging from orange to bright red), brown, yellow and white. The concepts on which the warnabali is based on are Tri Kono and Nawa Sanggha prescribed in some palm-leaf manuscripts such as Kereb Buwana, Dewa Tatwa and so forth.

While in the past the historical buildings were objects of aesthetic value and in consequence of it they became objects of preservation and restoration, today it seems that the analysis falls mainly on the object itself , particularly recognizing its uniqueness and irreproducibility.

The last years have witnessed a lot of attention in presenting the architectural meaning in the architectural manifestations of the Jordanian architects. This emphasis was apparent in buildings that convey certain meanings, being influenced and subjected to the design contextual conditions. This orientation of architectural thinking was the outcome and the result of the practices of modern architecture in the early seventies, and the efforts Jordanian architects to reclaim such practices. This was questioned by some architects at a later stage, especially with the similarities that resulted in the outcomes that came to highlight either the particularity or identity of the project. The purity and abstraction of forms and masses came to contradict the Jordanian\u2019s Architects intention in attempting to create congruity between creativity as a basic necessity in architecture and the need to give the building a meaning at the other end. To convey this, the architect depended on previous notions and languages to generate a new message embodied in the architectural form of the building. This direction of utilizing former architectural languages and schools to create and design architectural projects was adopted, and such it became the main attribute of Jordanian Architecture practices for the last 10 years of the 20 th century.

Geoffrey Bawa (1919-2003), not well known in our ambience, was Sri Lanka's most influential architect and South Asia's leading guru of unique style, named tropical architecture. The distinction of his work is outstanding aesthetic sensitivity to site and context, especially to peculiar climatic conditions and demands. For his architectural opus he received in 2001 prestigious Aga Khan Award for Architecture, Special Chairman's Award. Although he started to engage in architecture late, in age of 38, soon he became a noted by his inventiveness in forming new canons and prototypes of modern architecture, based on traditional knowledge and perfectly fitted in local surrounding. Bawa created sustainable architecture even before the term started to be used and his masterpieces broke down the barrier between inside and outside space, designing of the interior and landscaping, reducing the building to a series of scenic spaces separated by courtyards and gardens. He is well known by his designs for private villas and hotels, but his portfolio contains public building, as schools and universities, new Sri Lanka's Parliament, sacral, office and industrial structures.
