The main advantage of BIPV compared to BAPV is that it contributes to an aesthetically more acceptable result. Secondary benefits are the possible material savings, financial savings, and a contribution to the environmental consciousness impression of the building owner or occupant. To reach a successful large-scale realization of BIPV projects, the building process has to be adapted to the implementation of BIPV.

Morocco imports more than 98 % of its energy. As a result, it has turned its attention to renewable energy, particularly in the southern part of the country, with the objective of increasing renewables\u2019 share in the country\u2019s energy mix. Southern Morocco has significant solar potential. The annual daily averages of sunshine duration, $$ \\overline{n} $$ , range from 6.7 h (Tan Tan) to 8.7 h (La\u00e2youne), and those of the global irradiation on horizontal surface, $$ \\overline{H} $$ , vary between 4.87 kWh/m2 (Tan Tan) and 5.54 kWh/m2 (Dakhla). The estimated daily direct normal radiation in La\u00e2youne is 5.55 kWh/m2, which means about 3175 h of sunshine per year. Seasonal variations in sunshine, \u03c3, and the clearness index, Kt, for La\u00e2youne and Dakhla are more regular compared to that in Tan Tan; \u03c3 decreases rapidly in summer. This particularity reflects the greater oceanic influence and consequently the presence of a microclimate around Tan Tan, a finding confirmed by the research of J. Buret-Bahraoui. Morocco enjoys an excellent wind potential, particularly in the south. The wind speed annual averages vary between 5.12 m/s at 9 m for Tan Tan and 7.64 m/s at 10 m for Dakhla. The annual frequencies for the class 0 m/s are small for the three considered sites, less than 4 %. A study of wind speed frequency distributions shows that the observed frequencies are well modeled by the Weibull hybrid function. In 2013, wind energy contributed 4.2 % to national electricity production. In 2014, installed wind power in Morocco reached 757.3 MW, with 60 % located in the south. Tarfaya has a 301.3 MW private wind farm. Wind electricity production is estimated at 1.119 GWh/year, making it the largest wind farm in Morocco and Africa; in contrast, Dakhla is not connected to the national grid.

Reliable information about the energy output has arisen only in recent years; however, it is still not easily accessible, and sometimes its sources are closed. Despite these facts, solar energy researchers, observers and designers devote special attention to this type of SAC systems. In this study, performance evaluation is performed for the PV-SAC technology, in which low-power (up to 15 kW p of cooling power on average) systems are used. Such a system contains a PV electric-driven compression chiller with cold and heat sensible thermal storage capacities, and a rejected energy unit used for preheating domestic hot water (DHW). In a non-cooling season, it is possible to partly employ the system in the reverse mode for DHW production. In this mode, the ambient air serves as a heat source.

Solar cooling is a promising way for a sustainable air-conditioning system. However, since solar has intermittent output, it is usually backed-up by a conventional heater.

This study presents the effect of ratio of heat delivered by solar to the total heat delivered to an adsorption chiller (solar fraction) on the economic performance of a solar cooling system. This cooling system need covers cooling demand for an office building in a tropical region (Kuala Lumpur). Cooling demand was simulated using well-known energy analysis software for building, Equest. Flat-plate collectors and an adsorption chiller were the main component of the cooling system. Flat-plate collecters were simulated using another software, Watsun, and the adsorption chiller was based on our simulation model that is comparable with other studies. Economic performance was analyzed by life cycle cost analysis. Solar fraction of 0.33, 0.74 and 0.98 were studied. It was found that none of the solar fraction studied can generate Net Profit under subsidized electricity. It was also found that a natural gas boiler is a better solution than an electric heater as an auxiliary heater in term of economic. For a natural gas boiler, Net Profit increased when solar fraction decreased; the highest one was solar fraction of 0.33 with US$15,600.

Critical issues, for example related to the integration of vacuum-tube collectors into the building, are highlighted. The review shows that most of the proposed vacuum-tube/BIST concepts are about fa\u00e7ade-integration and there are few studies about the environmental profile of vacuum-tube collectors. As a continuity of the issues presented in the first part, the second part includes a case study about the environmental comparison of a vacuum-tube/BIST system with a flat-plate/BIST configuration, based on life cycle assessment. The systems are gutter-integrated, patented and they have been developed/tested at the University of Corsica, in France. Multiple life-cycle impact assessment methodologies, environmental indicators, scenarios and databases are adopted. The results reveal that the energy-payback time is 1.8 and 0.5 years, for the flat-plate/BIST and for the vacuum-tube/BIST, respectively, while by using recycling these values become 0.5 and 0.1 years, respectively. Energy-return-on-investment, greenhouse-gas payback time and avoided impact during use phase (by adopting USEtox, ecological footprint and France\u00b4s electricity as well as with reference domestic-gas-boiler CO2.eq emissions) are also presented. The findings of the present work: 1) are compared with the literature and good agreement is observed, 2) verify that considerably higher impact can be avoided by utilizing the vacuum-tube/BIST instead of the flat-plate/BIST system.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2494865454"}}

Many installed solar thermally driven cooling systems suffer from high auxiliary electric energy consumption which makes them not more efficient than conventional compression cooling systems. A main reason for this is the use of non-efficient controls with constant set points that do not allow a chiller power modulation at partial-load and therefore lead to unnecessary high power consumption of the parasitics. The aims of this paper are to present a method to control efficiently solar thermally driven chillers, to demonstrate experimentally its applicability and to quantify the benefits. It has been shown that the cooling capacity of a diffusion absorption chiller can be modulated very effectively by adjusting both the temperature and the flow rate of the cooling water. With the developed approach and the use of optimization algorithms, both the temperature and the flow rate can be controlled simultaneously in a way that the cooling load is matched and the electricity consumption is minimized. Depending on the weather and operating conditions, electricity savings between 20% and 60% can be achieved compared to other tested control approaches. The highest savings are obtained when the chiller is operated at partial load.

This paper suggests the application of the solar energy stored in solar ponds to air-condition small residential buildings, through the use of absorption machines. A feasibility analysis was carried out in some places characterized by climates that are suitable to make the solution here suggested sustainable from an energetic point of view. Buildings characterized by different boundary surface/volume ratios were examined and the energy saving, the amount of CO2 that was not emitted in the environment and the return of investments with respect to a more traditional solution were evaluated.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2520643382"}}

Abstract Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) have attracted considerable interests because of its aesthetically attractive appearance and overall low cost. In BIPV, system integration on a glass substrate like windows is essential to cover a large area of a building with low cost. However, the conventional high voltage devices in inverters have to be built on the specially selected single crystal substrates, limiting its application for large area electronic systems, such as the BIPV. We demonstrate a Magnesium Zinc Oxide (MZO) based high voltage thin film transistor (HVTFT) built on a transparent glass substrate. The devices are designed with unique ring-type structures and use modulated Mg doping in the channel - gate dielectric interface, resulting in a blocking voltage of over 600 V. In addition to BIPV, the MZO HVTFT based inverter technology also creates new opportunities for emerging self-powered smart glass.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2530851546"}}

With Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) representing most of the world\u2019s energy storage installed capacity and given its maturity and simplicity, the question stands as to whether this technology could be used on a smaller scale, namely in buildings. In this paper, the feasibility of such an installation is analysed by modelling each one of its components and applying it to several installation scenarios. Proposed and existing installations are also reviewed, including a first-time analysis of an installation in France, which is presumably the only existing building with an integrated PHES system. It was found that the economies of scale that render large PHES installations competitive are not present in small installations. This limitation, associated to other important disadvantages, such as the large volume required, seem to point out PHES as an ill-suited solution for energy storage in buildings, an important finding for building design and energy policy. Nevertheless, if synergies with existing reservoirs could be found (for example for a building on a riverside), costs could be significantly lowered.

This building type is generally well suited to receive a new double-skin fa\u00e7ade, supporting both PV and other common cladding materials, while also representing a good compromise in terms of aesthetic quality, cost, weight, durability and ease of maintenance. In order to make general conclusions, a parametric analysis is performed, by virtually changing the orientation, the number of floors and the climatic conditions, and by considering different PV technologies.

Most of the BIPV applications in facades concern glazed systems where PV cells are included within a laminated glass (e.g. in curtain walls or structural facade). Integrating photovoltaic in surfaces of the building envelope, involves a strong integration of energy, electrical, architectural and construction requirements during the whole process, from early-design phase till to manufacturing and operation. A collaborative and integrated planning approach by architects, engineers and manufacturers becomes essential, so that the development of methods, models and tools oriented to optimally support an integrated planning and construction process (i.e. the BIM approach) is a crucial aspect of growing interest. In the framework of the European project Construct PV, the authors collaborated in developing a web-tool aimed to support, since the early design phase, the integrated design of a customizable BIPV component for the integration into the building skin, within an interoperable process based on Building Information Modeling (BIM).

It is used to increase the temperature of water up to 700C by direct solar radiation absorption. But the flat plate collector has low thermal efficiency due to less surface area. Other disadvantage of flat plate solar collector is improper thermal stratification. So to overcome these drawbacks, new solar geometry used with different tube arrangement. The main aim of this project is to fabricate a low cost solar water heater which gives hot warm water for bathing as well as washing purpose. In proposed system umbrella shape absorber geometry is used, which gives more effective area as compare to flat plate collector subjected to heat transfer.

Environmental shading will decrease the effectivity of BIPV. But, integrated configuration of folding-BIPV is expected to create more numbers of solar receiving area. The integrated configuration of folding-BIPV will create optimum BIPV, both in electrical generation and building form giver. Experiment to low rise office building in tropical climate is done by giving folding treatment. The experiment also considers about environmental shading. Evaluation is done by analyzing and optimizing the numbers and uniformity of solar radiation received. Simulation with ARCHIPAK 5.1 is used as experimental research tool.

A heat-recovery ventilator (HRV) effectively conducts ventilation by recovering waste heat from indoors to outdoors during heating periods. However, dew condensation associated with the HRV system may arise due to the difference between the indoor temperature and the very low outdoor temperature in winter, and this can decrease the heat exchange efficiency. These problems can be solved by the pre-heating of the incoming air, but additional energy is required when pursuing such a strategy. On the other hand, an air-type photovoltaic thermal (PVT) system produces electricity and thermal energy simultaneously using air as the heat transfer medium. Moreover, the heated air from the air-type PVT system can be connected to the HRV to pre-heat the supply air instead of taking in the cold outdoor air. Thus, the ventilation efficiency can be improved and the problems arising during the heating period can be resolved. Consequentially, the heating energy required in a building can be reduced, with additional electricity acquired as well. In this paper, the performance of an air-type PVT system coupled with an HRV is assessed. To do this, air-type PVT collectors operating at 1 kWp were installed in an experimental house and coupled to an HRV system.

Over the last decade, increasing numbers of multi-national corporations, public institutions and individual property owners have become interested in installing solar photovoltaics and small wind turbines. To best inform this broad range of actors, this research aims to assess the financial viability of such investments across broad city regions whilst maintaining accuracy at individual properties. Publicly available digital representations of urban surfaces are central to meeting this aim because they can be used to assess the area, slope and orientation of potential solar photovoltaic (PV) installation sites and to define how vertical wind profiles are altered by urban areas. A first study utilised digital surface models (DSMs) across seven UK cities to assess the roof spaces available for solar PV and also incorporated socio-economic factors to define the propensity for cities to install the technology. Despite changes to financial incentives that had recently occurred, the technologies remained viable at a very large number of locations and could theoretically meet large percentages (16% to 43%) of the cities\u2019 electricity demands. The accuracy of slope, orientation and available area estimation in roof geometry modelling was then improved through the development of a neighbouring buildings method. In 87% of 536 validated results, the method identified the correct roof shape and roof slope was estimated to a mean absolute error of 3.76\u00b0 when compared to 182 measured roofs. Work was then undertaken to improve solar insolation modelling. A radiative transfer model was created that incorporated shading based on DSM data. It estimated the power output of 17 solar PV installations across four UK cities with +2.62% mean percentage error when its 2013 insolation estimates were converted to power outputs using a 0.8 performance ratio. The validation data showed that the RTS model outperformed the market-leading esri ArcMap solar radiation software which incurred a -15.97% mean percentage error. This method was then adapted to be deployable on a city scale and predicted solar insolation with a mean percentage error of -4.39% despite the process being made far more computationally efficient. A method to estimate long-term average wind speeds for urban areas was then developed that produced results of comparable accuracy to an existing model but with considerably reduced computational demand and complexity in deployment. The mean absolute error inwind speed estimation was just 1.75% greater using the simplified methodology than the existing model. Finally, the improved modelling of roof geometries, solar insolation and long-term mean wind speed were brought together to evaluate the city-scale potential for solar PV and small to medium wind microgeneration. The research has shown that wind and solar PV microgeneration at sites that pay back within nine years could theoretically meet 88.5% of annual domestic electricity demand in the city of Leeds, or would be the equivalent of providing electricity to 300,319 homes. Current financial contexts were used to define a baseline scenario from which hypothetical changes to a variety of factors influencing microgeneration viability were investigated. When the costs and revenues were defined from a pessimistic, but still realistic, perspective the percentage of the study area\u2019s electricity demand that could theoretically be met by wind and solar PV microgeneration fell to 0.1%. This suggests that government policy will continue to play a key role in the future growth of UK wind and solar PV deployment.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2580089019"}}

Renewable energy resources and technologies are sufficient to meet all of humanity\u2019s energy requirements, provided that the transition to renewables is accompanied in parallel by intense, disciplined initiatives to design, fabricate, and distribute ubiquitously an emerging class of ultra-efficient energy consuming devices. Renewables can thereby power devices which are disruptively more energy-efficient in the delivery of fundamental energy services (food production, cooking, heating, cooling, mobility, logistics, lighting, industrial processes, information systems, etc.). Rather than substituting new energy sources to directly power legacy devices that were originally designed on the basis of fossil fuels, designers will develop these novel devices to deliver superior performance in all respects: cleaner, safer, more durable, more convenient, and more economical. This Solarevolution, like the Industrial Revolution two hundred years ago, is about transforming the artifacts of human society. Just as labor-saving machinery replaced manual and animal labor when James Watt invented the steam engine, so now energy-saving devices powered directly by non-polluting solar electricity are beginning to replace those inefficient brute force artifacts that still depend on the burning of fossil fuels. Building upon historic perspectives and the careful examination of key renewable energy qualities, four case studies will be highlighted, not to resolve all of the issues, but to instantiate the pivotal role of design science to avert the most severe impacts of global warming and strategic resources depletion.

The installation of Photovoltaic (PV) solar systems in institutions as well as homesteads in the rural areas in Kenya is increasing at a high rate; and so is the need for the stake holders to make sure the PV solar systems are professionally designed, sized, installed and maintained. In PV solar system installation, the designing, sizing and the installation are very critical steps. A wrongly designed, sized and installed system will not perform optimally and will underperform (for undersized systems) and waste energy and resources (for oversized systems). Furthermore, undersized systems do not perform to the user's expectation discouraging the user and eventually a negative customer attitude creeps in which may affect the uptake of solar PV systems. On the other hand, an oversized PV system is extra expense on the side of the client, creating an exaggerated high cost of PV solar systems, again discouraging potential clients from the adoption of the technology. Both scenarios mean loss of business, jobs and the economic and social benefits associated with PV technology. We present a case study of poorly installed PV systems in Makueni County, Kenya. We observed that the solar modules specifications at the back of the modules were not clearly done, the batteries were poorly matched and the cables used in the installation were undersized.

Emissions from photovoltaic (PV) energy systems in Zero Emission Buildings have been shown to have a relative large share of material emissions. In this paper, we compare GHG emissions per kW h of electricity and greenhouse gas emission payback times (GPBT) for three residential PV systems in Zero Emission Pilot Buildings in Norway. All the buildings have roof mounted PV systems with different design solutions. The objective is to analyse the emission loads and GPBT of these three systems to facilitate for more informed choices of energy systems for Zero Emission Buildings. The results show that the total embodied emissions allocated per square meter of module area are around 150\u2013350 kg CO2 eq/m2 for the three different systems. Emissions from the mounting systems vary from 10 to 25 kg CO2 eq/m2 depending on the material types and quantities used. When modules replace other roofing materials, such as roof tiles, mounting emissions were reduced by approximately 60%. GHG emissions per kW h electricity produced were in the range of 30\u2013120 g CO2 eq/kW h for the different systems. The system with the lowest emissions was the largest system, which had a simple mounting structure and modules with reused cells.

The increasing living standards in developed countries lead to increased energy consumption. The fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas effect that accompany the energy production can be reduced by using renewable energy. For instance, the solar thermal systems can be used in temperate climates to provide heating during the transient period or cooling during the warmer months. Most used solar thermal systems contain flat plate solar collectors. In order to provide the necessary energy for the house cooling system, the cooling machine uses a working fluid with a high temperature, which can be supplied by dish concentrator collectors. These collectors are continuously rotated towards sun by biaxial tracking systems, process that increases the consumed power. An algorithm for a step tracking program to be used in the orientation of parabolic dish concentrator collectors is proposed in the paper to reduce the consumed power due to actuation. The algorithm is exemplified on a case study: a dish concentrator collector to be implemented in Brasov, Romania, a location with the turbidity factor TR equal to 3. The size of the system is imposed by the environment, the diameter of the dish reflector being of 3 meters. By applying the proposed algorithm, 60 sub-programs are obtained for the step orientation of the parabolic dish collector over the year. Based on the results of the numerical simulations for the step orientation, the efficiency of the direct solar radiation capture on the receptor is up to 99%, while the energy consumption is reduced by almost 80% compared to the continuous actuation of the concentrator solar collector.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2518256869"}}

This thesis is a case study of the application of an energy audit to determine the energy use and potential energy efficiency measures in an office building in Uppsala (Sweden). The motivation of this analysis is the increasing concern about the environmental impact which stems from buildings energy consumption and the interest in an increased sustainability in this sector. Afterwards, in line with the interest in more sustainable buildings, the possibility of installing a grid connected photovoltaic system has been analyzed. The system feasibility has been researched through the creation of a model of the system and the simulation of different possible configurations. The energy audit has involved many tasks. First of all, the plans of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems have been analyzed to understand their operation. The data from bills have been also useful to identify tendencies in the electrical and heating energy consumption of the facility. This has allowed to estimate the heating and cooling loads in the building. Afterwards, the facility has been visited to conduct an energy survey. A thorough inspection of the energy systems in the building has been carried out to find possible energy efficiency measures. Besides, the electric power consumption of these systems has been recorded by loggers to analyze its evolution and look into their operation schedule. Measurements of the temperature, light and humidity in the office areas have been taken to assess the indoor comfort in the facility. An inventory of the fans and pumps for the different systems has also been carried out to check and validate the results from the loggers. This process has allowed to allocate the energy use of the different systems and to prepare the energy balance in the building. The results match with the data from the bills and the inspection in the facility. Several energy efficiency measures have been found thanks to the audit, with a potential for energy savings of 126 MWh. The economical analysis of these measures has shown that most of them are profitable, and they can reduce the greenhouse gases emissions by between 5.87 and 59.4 tons of annual equivalent CO2 depending on the applied approach to estimate the effect of electricity production in greenhouse gases emissions. On the other hand, the study of the photovoltaic system has been done through computer simulations with PVsyst. The use of PVsyst has been vital because there are several factors to take into account when designing a photovoltaic system. The meteorological data for Uppsala have been taken from different sources, but only the data from the database Meteonorm have been proved to be reliable for the simulations. The next step has been the creation of a 3D model of the building and the system to reflect the effect of shadings in the system. Then, several configurations with different tilt angles and pitches have been compared to find the one with the best performance. The optimal configuration - tilt angle of 10 _ and pitch of 3 m - has led to the highest performance ratio and electricity production. This configuration has been used to perform a deeper comparison between modules and inverters from different manufacturers. The best combination regarding the electricity production and performance ratio is the use of a PV module from Renewable Energy Corporation and an inverter from AEG, with a performance ratio of 0.821 and a yearly electricity production of 30.1 MWh. However, this configuration does not produce any energy surplus that can be sold to a utility company. An economical analysis using two sets of prices has shown that the total investment for the considered system would lie between 244000-1189000 SEK, with a payback period of 10 to 47 years, and therefore would not be economically feasible.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2592381011"}}

In a reconfigurable PV panel, the connections between groups of cells (cell-strings) can be rearranged in order to increase the overall power output under non-uniform conditions. In a traditional PV panel, current mismatch between the series-connected cells (due to irradiation differences of differential aging) limits the generated power output by either reducing the overall current or by bypassing the substring containing the limiting cells. A reconfigurable panel can respond to such a situation by changing the connections to a more favorable configuration, allowing the majority of the cells to operate at their MPP. This paper elaborates on such a topology and its components (high current switches, wiring). To get a clearer picture of the added value of such a reconfigurable panel, a detailed energy yield analysis was performed which includes the performance of those added components. The simulation model used for this analysis is calibrated with extensive measurement results. A comparison of that model and corresponding measurements will be discussed.

(\u2026) Facilities Management division has sought help in designing a project that will accomplish these goals. A 10 kW grid-tied PV system has been proposed that will be centrally located on campus. The system will serve as a living, learning laboratory for the campus community. The solar panels for the system will be mounted on three structures approximately 10 to 14 feet off the ground, which will also provide shade and shelter from the elements. Underneath the solar panels will be benches, tables, electrical outlets, and special hooks for students to hang hammocks. A small garden featuring native plant life will be planted around the solar panel structure. Small informational signage will be displayed throughout the garden informing visitors about the benefits of sustainable energy and how a PV system works. As part of this effort, an engineering capstone project team was responsible for researching, designing, and proposing a PV system for (\u2026). A shading analysis was first conducted in multiple locations on campus to determine where the most sunlight hours occurred. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory\u2019s PVWatts1 Calculator was later utilized to estimate how much energy the system would generate per year and how much money the system would save the university. Greenhouse gas savings estimates were also calculated to determine the amount of reduction in CO2 emissions.

Since the university must use a third party to install the PV system, a local installer was contacted to gather a professional opinion.

After a formal presentation by the engineering capstone team, the (\u2026) SEI Committee has decided to move forward with the project. The preliminary research involved gathering information on exactly how a PV system works. Further research revealed the necessity for Maximum Power Point Tracking in solar inverters. The engineering capstone team has investigated the benefits of oversizing a PV system with a 1.25 array-to-inverter ratio2. A vital part of this research involved emissions reduction calculations and payoff estimates. The emissions reduction calculations showed that the system would reduce CO2 emissions of the school by approximately five tons annually. Payoff of the system was calculated to be approximately 39.25 years. If the university were able to claim the 35 % (\u2026) solar energy tax credits, the payoff would be reduced to approximately 12 years.

The envelope of a building offers a so far unused potential for the energy generation. Modern technologies allow a full integration of solar components into the facade or other parts of the building shell. This promotes the expansion of renewable energies without increasing the necessary areas for green field installations. However, their early integration into the planning process of a building is still a complex and labour intensive task. Our approach aims to simplify the procedure by improving methods and technologies like Building Information Modelling and Industry Foundation Classes, and later combining them with a Multi-Agent-based platform. This work presents the necessary steps to digitally describe building integrated solar elements in an open standard. Therefore, we mark the need of an expansion to the IFC structure and afterwards suggest a solution to classify these products correctly.

Increased PVdeployment on apartment buildings represents a valuable market opportunity for the PV industry, which wouldallow apartment dwellers to obtain the financial benefits of using PV to offset electricity bills. PV on apartmentbuildings could also help relieve network congestion, as it is a good fit with commercial loads commonly foundin urban areas, and might therefore benefit network operators as well as households. Some recent high-density residential developments incorporate a PV system for each residential unit, or anembedded network serving all units. However, in existing apartment buildings, as well as physical and otherbarriers to PV installation[1], legal arrangements can create additional difficulties for individual rooftop PVsystems and there may be specific technical and economic barriers to the installation of embedded networks. Inthese cases, installing PV to supply common property demand (sometimes a high proportion of total buildingdemand) may present a simpler retrofitting opportunity. Common property load varies significantly between apartment buildings and may include lighting for commonareas, and carparks; lifts; water heating and pumping for centralised hot water and pools; air conditioning andventilation. Its characteristics and diversity are not well understood, with a 2008 DEWHA report identifying theneed for further research into communal area energy use in high and medium density housing.

The proposed PV system makes use of special areas of the Lebanese lands; the middle of high-ways which are usually left unoccupied without being exploited by any other business. This way, the traditional high cost of PV systems residing in the land and storage is eliminated.

Product-integrated photovoltaics (PIPV) began to be widely introduced around 2000, although the use of PV systems in products dates back to the 70s.

Rooftop and small-scale photovoltaic (PV) technology is a quickly growing sector of the distributed generation market. The array size chosen for a PV installation is one of the main factors affecting its ability to meet a building\u2019s electrical needs and reduce its operational emissions. The rooftop area available for placement of PV can be a constraint on the optimization of PV array size. If the optimal array area for a specific building is larger than the area available on the rooftop, optimization using demand-matching methods is not necessary. A new parameter EUI-R has been introduced to describe the building\u2019s annual electrical demand with respect to the building rooftop area. It is a decision-making tool presented to help a system designer choose whether to employ an optimization method or not in selecting a PV system.

The integration of photovoltaic technologies in buildings is considered as promising way to profit by renewable energies in the built environment, with many advantages. Nevertheless, dealing with PV in architecture is still a challenge for architects and engineers both because of aesthetic and technical issues. There are at least two ways to integrate photovoltaic technologies in the building skin design concept: emphasizing the use of solar energy (high-tech approach) or trying to hide them with the use of a camouflage technology, thanks to the use of colour filters or painting techniques. This paper focus on the investigation of the performance behaviour of different coloured modules developed within the European Project SMART-FLeX. Within the project a special digital technique has been developed to print the front glass of BIPV modules, offering to the architect many possibility of design. It is clear, that paintings on front glass will shadow the solar cells, influencing in that way the performance of modules. In order to assess the impact of this technology on module performance extensive indoor measurements have been done by the authors. Therefore, prototype modules of different colour and printing degrees were assembled and investigated under standard and weak-light conditions, electroluminescence tests, spectral responsivity and temperature coefficient measurements. Outdoor assessment in two different location (Lugano and Berlin) will also provide important information on modules behaviour in real condition.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2588886436"}}

The main purpose of building breakwaters is to produce safe havens for ships and boats in rough seas. The general architecture for a breakwater is a wall with a trapezoidal-shaped cross section extending parallel to the shoreline. As the waves from the open sea approach, they are encountered by the so-called slope and revetment of the breakwater, where the wave is broken and its energy is dissipated and/or reflected back. However, the ever-increasing attractiveness of the utilization of waves as energy sources, paralleling to the increasing monetary and environmental costs of energy, has led the authors to consider the vast amounts of this otherwise dissipated energy into useful electrical energy. A wave energy conversion concept, which can be classified as an overtopping wave energy converter was conceived, where the open sea-facing (revetment) side of the breakwater is fitted by a water collecting channel at a suitable height above the calm water level, running alongside the breakwater. The channel leads the collected water to a powerhouse containing a low head turbine (or a set of such turbines) discharging it to the calm water of the inner harbour. Power obtained from these turbines can be converted to electrical energy. In this study, an estimation of the volume of water collected by the channel and the energy production for a proposed breakwater - power station system for a typical rough weather shall be made. It is deemed that the feasibility of this system is comparable to and even higher than the other wave energy conversion systems since it does not require additional facilities and power supply lines to be built due to its proximity to the existing energy transmission lines, except for the addition of new features/installations to the existing breakwaters.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2469494775"}}

The increased penetration of residential air-conditioners (AC); specifically vapor compression types, is regarded as one of the foremost causes of a dramatic rise in critical peak electricity demands requiring corresponding upgrades of electricity infrastructures. These upgrades requires heavy investments, consequently, driving up electricity prices. Solar air-conditioning systems can reduce this trend, but current vapor-compression air-conditioners (VCACs) needs very large investments in both photovoltaic system and battery storage. Alternatively solar heat-driven absorption chillers need less expensive solar collectors and thermal storage, drawing only small amounts of electricity to overcome parasitic power. There are ample studies conducted previously on either the technical and/or economic feasibility of solar heat driven absorption chillers. But these studies are only focused on supplementing solar heat energy with an auxiliary heater. This study, examines the option of running the absorption chiller by solely relying on solar heat energy. It focuses on minimizing the life cycle cost of a solar heat driven absorption chiller through optimizing the size of all of its main components. The system is named the standalone solar heat fired absorption chiller (SA-SHF-ABS-CH) sized to sufficiently meet the space conditioning demands, both heating and cooling, of a typical Australian 6 star home. For the aims of this research, TRNSYS17 software was used in modelling and dynamically simulating the integrated system, while GenOpt software was used to carry out the optimization. The economic assessment on the most optimally sized system component configuration shows, firstly, the twenty-year lifecycle cost of the system with the most minimized cost is AU$ 53,387 in Brisbane, AU$ 51,639 in Adelaide and AU$ 32,816 in Melbourne. These investment costs in each of these cities appear higher than those incurred if the householder were to instead install a standard efficient inverter, ducted, reverse cycle air conditioner (IRC-AA-HP) powered by grid electricity; as follows: Brisbane at 77%, Adelaide at 58% and Melbourne at 28%. Secondly, the payback period was found to be longer than the twenty-year system service- life, which is far too long to justify the investment on such solar air-conditioner. However, when compared with IRC-AA-HP, in Adelaide and Melbourne, SA-SHF-ABS-CH consumed at least 50% less power, meaning it offsets half of the carbon dioxide emissions, furthermore, it draws 75% lesser critical peak kWp power, which means it has strong potential to obviate the need for heavy investments in electrical infrastructures, ultimately contributing to mitigating rapid electricity price rises.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2479581518"}}

The importance of BIPV and facade utilization in new city developments is discussed, along with key questions raised by the commercial developer regarding the practical implementation of BIPV solutions. Based on feedback from the building industry, a simplified model has been implemented to evaluate surface areas producing a profit or a loss over the PV system lifetime. As tilted photovoltaic (PV) modules installed on flat roofs are not building integrated, three simulation variants have been performed for flat roofs with a small inclination up to ten degrees.

This paper discusses air conditioning system by using solar thermal energy for performance enhancement and energy efficiency improvement. An evacuated solar collector with hot water storage tank would be installed after the compressor to increase coefficient of performance (COP) of the system at full load. Solar energy and waste energy are fully utilized so less power would be required to run compressor, this is turn allows for smaller compressor to be installed that offer even better savings on power consumption. The proposed system delivers higher system efficiency owing to the higher refrigeration effect in the direct expansion evaporator. According to calculation results, the refrigeration effect of proposed method is increased than that of conventional method. The decreased in mass flow rate is due to increased refrigeration effect and a decrease in compressor work (increased COP). Thus, the novel development is expecting for improvement of energy efficiency, enhancement of the system performance while fulfilling the cooling demand. Consequently, this system can be saved around 40% of electrical energy.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2523162978"}}

In view of the importance of urban renewal processes, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems can potentially provide a crucial response to the energy turnaround challenges. Functioning both as envelope material and electricity generator, they can simultaneously reduce the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases emissions while providing savings in materials and electricity costs. However, despite continuous technological and economic progress, the assets of BIPV remain undervalued in the current practice. Various obstacles (technology choice, small volumes, lack of information and good examples) tend to increase the costs and reduce the project acceptance. To overcome these barriers, an interdisciplinary research project developed an approach based on four main phases: 1) selection of archetypal residential buildings, 2) detailed analysis of the buildings, 3) development of renewal design scenarios and 4) multi-criteria assessment of each scenario. Focusing on the architectural-scale, this paper presents design strategies with BIPV solutions of a representative case study realized in Neuch\u00e2tel (Switzerland).

Although several programs are available that assist in designing a photovoltaic (PV) system, a planning tool that can take an adaptive modeling approach towards capitalizing on the complex geometry of a rooftop does not exist. We therefore focus on the development of a parametric planning tool for retrofitting rooftops with solar photovoltaic systems. The solar planning tool exploits the existing blueprint of a building's rooftop, and via image processing, the layouts of the solar photovoltaic arrays are developed based on the building's geographical location and typical weather patterns. The resulting energy generation of a PV system is estimated and is utilized to determine the leveled energy costs. The advantage of incorporating image processing in the design of a PV system not only reduces the time required for performing a robust solar PV analysis but also enables a high-level of dimensional precision when modeling the solar arrays, thus making a rooftop solar photovoltaic system installation ultimately more cost-effective.

As the building sector is moving to net-zero energy building performance targets and beyond, the use of building integrated solar systems becomes essential. Semi-transparent photovoltaic (STPV) window technologies are expected to play a key role in on-site electricity generation of new and retrofitted high-performance commercial and institutional buildings. In most commercial and high-rise residential buildings where reducing the costs of cooling energy is important, STPV windows can be used as integrated strategy to reduce solar heat gains and generate solar electricity while still providing adequate daylight and view to the outdoors. The research presented on this thesis is based on the conviction that window technologies should be considered as an integral part of a broad strategy of energy-conserving, energy-efficient building design. The main objective of this work is to provide a systematic study of STPV windows through experimental work and simulations that will allow these technologies to become ubiquitous on buildings in the near future. The end goal is to transform buildings from energy consumers to energy producers without compromising on occupancy comfort. Hence, all performance characteristics (e.g., electrical, thermal and daylighting) should be studied and quantified individually and in combination in order to capture the impact such technologies have on the building energy performance and occupancy comfort. In this work, design concepts of windows integrating STPV technologies are developed, modelled and studied in typical perimeter zones. The thermal and electrical performance of four crystalline Si-based prototype STPV windows was studied experimentally. Specially designed prototypes were mounted in a calibrated hot-box calorimeter apparatus developed for this study. The apparatus is placed inside a two-storey high environmental chamber with a solar simulator (SSEC) and exposed to emulated sunlight produced by a continuous solar simulator. The SSEC facility allows tests to be performed under fully controlled and repeatable conditions (temperature and irradiance). Operating cell temperatures of up to 80.5\u00b0C were observed under 1000 W/sq.m irradiation, still air and ambient air temperature of 21\u00b0C. An experimental procedure for the determination of Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) for STPV windows is also developed. It was found that the electricity generation from the STPV windows can result in up to 23% reduction of SHGC in comparison to a heat absorbing (e.g., tinted or fritted glass) window with the same optical and thermal properties. In addition, the performance data generated was used to verify thermal-electrical performance models for the prediction of cell operating temperatures and solar energy yield. Low-order thermal models for various STPV window assemblies were developed. Using typical meteorological weather data as inputs, the thermal models could predict the operating cell temperatures of an assembly (e.g., double glazed low-e argon window with integrated photovoltaics) within +/- 5\u00b0C, resulting in less than +/- 3% error in the annual solar energy yield. A general simulation methodology was developed integrating thermal, electrical and daylighting performance modelling. The methodology was applied to evaluate the potential benefits of various STPV facade designs in cooling-dominated commercial building applications under continental climate. The simulations revealed that the selection of the ideal STPV optical properties is sensitive on the daylight and lighting controls applied in the building, and photovoltaic cell technology utilized (crystalline Si-based spaced cells, a-Si \u201csee-through\u201d and fully transparent organic thin film technologies were examined). In regards to design of a building facade, it was shown that the three-section design concept integrating Si-based spaced PV cells on the upper section of the facade (daylight section) and \u201csee-through\u201d thin PV film on the middle section (view section) has the potential to maximize daylight utilization and view to the outdoors while minimizing the possibility for glare to occur and producing an optimal amount of solar electricity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2432381025"}}

In contrast to the superstrate cell design, a transparent n\u2010layer and back contact play a key role to achieve high bifaciality. We therefore increased the transparency of the n\u2010layer by adding CO 2 , increasing the PH 3 flow in the deposition gas and tested different thicknesses.

The development of clean and renewable energy is the one of the important challenges that scientist will confront in the near future. To get involved the young generation in learning solar energy seems to happen much more difficult, though. Accessibility of some of the materials through home or school-based experiments could be one of the main reasons why they are not eager to learn. Even the research currently made on semiconductors for solar energy conversion indicated the same result. On the other hand, dye sensitized solar cells (DSC) which are used for the electricity production from solar radiation are both cheap and easily accessed compared with the conventional photovoltaic cells. For these reasons, an experiment has been developed by using ordinary and harmless products for the construction of a dye sensitized solar cell that has the similar construction used in natural photosynthesis. The conversion of solar energy to electrical energy can be displayed through the usage of this simple and easily assembled construction. To check the utility of DSC on teaching solar energy conversion a project was realized. The aim of this project was to supply a cheap and an easily accessed hands-on exercise for high school students. Students were both given a short outline about the basic measurements related to photovoltaic cell performance and shown the characterization of this performance. They were also suggested to utilize these concepts for their demonstrations. Different simulation studies were carried out with various temperatures and irradiations.

Climate changes due to increase of CO2 emission are becoming a serious issue for this planet. The so called climate crisis has been the main topic of the last United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) . Direct conversion of sunlight into electricity is one of the most promising technology for achieving the COP 21 agreement. Wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells account for more than 90% of the total PV market because silicon is a non-toxic and abundant material and Si-based PV modules have demonstrated long term stability and high durability. To maintain this technology dominant also in the coming years, continuous improvement in conversion efficiency without increasing processing costs are required. In this thesis novel solutions based on opto-electrical surface engineering are presented as potential solutions to increase conversion efficiency and/or decrease the costs of wafer-based c-Si solar cells. In particular, advanced light management techniques were developed to enhance light absorption in thin c-Si absorber and to fabricate customized PV products for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications. This thesis begins with introducing, theoretical limits (Chapter 1), working principles and current status (Chapter 2) of waferbased c-Si solar cells. In Chapter 3 the losses analysis of industrial multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cell was performed by using the ASA simulation tool. Such analysis pointed out the main opto-electrical losses for a mc-Si solar cell which were tackled in the next Chapters. In particular, Chapter 4 deals with design and fabrication of advanced light trapping scheme for minimizing optical losses of state-of-the-art c-Si solar cells. To this aim a combination of surface textures with different geometrical scales were used in order to trigger several optical effects. In particular, nano-texturing fabricated via reactive ion etching (RIE) on the front side and micro texturing based on alkaline etching on the rear side were used providing broadband light-in coupling and light scattering. Almost ideal back reflectors such as Ag or Distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR) were applied on the rear side. By using such light trapping scheme, the so-called 4n2 absorption enhancement limit, which has been elusive for more than 30 years was experimentally demonstrated on a broad wavelength range. The interdigitated back contact (IBC) c-Si solar cell was indicated as the most promising solar cell architecture to apply such light trapping scheme. This technology was not available within the PVMD group. Therefore, in Chapter 5 a simplified self-aligned process for fabrication high efficiency IBC c-Si solar cells was demonstrated. The process involved the combination of ion implantation and epitaxial growth of in-situ doped Si. The process flow was optimized to minimize the thermal budget and the number of lithographic steps. By using only two lithographic steps, a conversion efficiency equal to 20.2% on 9 cm2 device was demonstrated. For such solar cell architecture it was shown that a lightly doped front surface field improves carrier collection. After developing a process flow for fabricating IBC c-Si solar cells, the application of the advanced light management technique to IBC was presented in Chapter 6. To this aim two major issues were tackled. The first was related to the removal of surface defects induced by the RIE process to decrease surface recombination. To achieve this goal a cost effective process was developed. The second dealt with adapting the light trapping scheme to the IBC process integration. To this aim, the decoupled front (nano-textured) and rear side (micotexturing) light trapping scheme of Chapter 4 was modified by superposing both texture scales on the front side of the wafer. This approach is called modulated surface texture (MST). The combination of the advanced light trapping and surface passivation schemes was employed in IBC c-Si solar cells. Top efficiency of 19.8% for MST-IBC solar cell was demonstrated. Advanced light management techniques were also applied to bifacial c-Si solar cells. The objective of this study was twofold: (i) enhancing cell efficiency by increasing the internal rear internal reflectance and (ii) providing novel solutions for BIPV applications. In particular, DBR and TiO2 particles in the form of white paint were used as back reflectors of bifacial c-Si solar cells. The DBR enabled the possibility of fabricating rear side coloured bifacial modules, which can be attractive for BIPV applications.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2765668729"}}

A proper BIPV element for facade should take into account thermal and insulation properties, factors as transparency to allow solar gains if possible or a good solar control if necessary, aspects that are linked and high dependent on climate conditions and on the level of comfort to be reached. However, the influence of different facade integrated photovoltaic solutions on the building energy consumption is not easy to assess under real operating conditions. Thermal aspects, indoor temperatures or luminance level that can be expected using building integrated PV (BIPV) modules are not well known. As said before, integrated photovoltaic BIPV components and the use of renewable energy is already a standard for green energy production, but would also be important to know the possible contribution to improve the comfort and health of building occupants. Comfort, light transmission or protection, thermal insulation or thermal/electricity power production are aspects that are usually considered alone, while all together contribute to the building global energy balance. Besides, the need to prioritize a particular building envelope orientation to harvest the most benefit from the electrical or thermal energy production, in the case of active and passive systems respectively might be not compatible, but also not necessary. A holistic approach is needed to enable architects and engineers implementing technological systems working in synergy. A new concept have been suggested: \u201cC-BIPV, conscious integrated BIPV\u201d. BIPV systems have to be \u201cconsciously integrated\u201d which means that it is essential to know the positive and negative effects in terms of comfort and energy under real operating conditions.  Purpose of the work, method and results  The facade-integrated photovoltaic systems are often glass solutions easily integrable, as they usually are custommade. These BIPV semi-transparent components integrated as a window element provides natural lighting and shade that prevents overheating at times of excessive heat, but as static component, likewise avoid the possible solar gains contributions in the cold months. In addition, the temperature of the module varies considerably in ,certain circumstances influenced by the PV technology installed, solar radiation, mounting system, lack of ventilation, etc. This factor may result in additional heat input in the building highly variable and difficult to quantify. In addition, further insights into the indoor environmental comfort in buildings using integrated photovoltaic technologies are needed to open up thereby, a new research perspective. This research aims to study their behaviour through a series of experiments in order to define the real influence on comfort aspects and on global energy building consumption, as well as, electrical and thermal characteristics of these devices. The final objective was to analyze a whole set of issues that influence the global energy consumption/production in a building using BIPV modules by quantifying the global energy balance and the BIPV system real performances. Other qualitative issues to be studied were comfort aspect (thermal and lighting aspects) and the electrical behaviour of different BIPV technologies for vertical integration, aspects that influence both energy consumption and electricity production. Thus, it will be possible to obtain a comprehensive global characterization of BIPV systems. A specific design of an outdoor test facility, the BIPV Env-lab \u201cBIPV Test Laboratory\u201d, for the integral characterization of different BIPV semi-transparent modules was developed and built. The method and test protocol for the BIPV characterization was also defined in a real building context and weather conditions. This has been possible once assessed the state of the art and research, the aspects that influence the architectural integration and the different possibilities and types of integration for PV and after having examined the test methods for building and photovoltaic components, under operation conditions heretofore used. The test laboratory that consists in two equivalent test rooms (1:1) has a monitoring system in which reliable data of thermal, daylighting and electrical performances can be obtained for the evaluation of PV modules. The experimental set-up facility (testing room) allows studying three different aspects that affect building energy consumption and comfort issues: the thermal indoor comfort, the lighting comfort and the energy performance of BIPV modules tested under real environmental conditions. Knowing the energy balance for each experimented solar technology, it is possible to determine which one performs best. A theoretical methodology has been proposed for evaluating these parameters, as defined in this thesis as indices or indicators, which regard comfort issues, energy and the overall performance of BIPV components. This methodology considers the existing regulatory standards for each aspect, relating them to one another. A set of insulated glass BIPV modules see-through and light-through, representative of different PV technologies (mono-crystalline silicon technology, mc-Si, amorphous silicon thin film single junction, a-Si and copper indium selenide thin film technology CIS) were selected for a series of experimental tests in order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed characterization method. As result, it has been developed and generated the ICD Integral Characterization Diagram, a graphic and visual system to represent the results and manage information, a useful operational tool for decision-making regarding to photovoltaic installations. This diagram shows all concepts and parameters studied in relation to each other and visually provides access to all the results obtained during the experimental phase to make available all the qualitative and quantitative information on the energy performance of the BIPV components by characterizing them in a comprehensive way.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2339158221"}}

The present work investigates the feasibility of solar heating and cooling (SHC) absorption systems based on combining three types of LiBr\u2013H2O absorption chillers (single-, double-, and triple-effect) with common solar thermal collectors available on the market. A single-effect chiller is coupled with evacuated tube collectors (ETCs) \u2013 SHC1. A double-effect chiller is integrated with parabolic trough collectors (PTCs), linear Fresnel micro-concentrating collectors (MCTs) and evacuated flat plate collectors (EFPCs) respectively \u2013 SHC2, SHC3, and SHC4. PTCs are employed to provide high-temperature heat to a triple-effect absorption chiller (SHC5). Although triple-effect chillers have been around for a while, this paper represents the first system-level analysis of these chillers coupled with high-temperature solar concentrating collectors for air-conditioning applications. A simulation model for each configuration is developed in a transient system simulation environment (TRNSYS 17). Furthermore, a unique, comprehensive perspective is given by investigating the impact of characteristic solar beam radiation to global radiation ratios on the techno-economic performance of the proposed SHC plants for a wide variety of climatic regions worldwide. The results of parametric study suggest that a storage volume of around 70 L/m2 is a good choice for SHC1, while 40\u201350 L/m2 storage capacity is sufficient for the other configurations (SHC2 to SHC5). The simulation results reveal that when the fraction of direct normal irradiance (DNI) is less than 50%, SHC2, SHC3, and SHC5 require larger collector area compared to SHC1, showing there is no advantage in using concentrating collector powered multi-effect chillers over solar single-effect chillers in climates with low DNI level. However, in climates with DNI fractions above 60%, the smallest solar field is achieved by SHC5, followed by SHC2. SHC4, which benefits from both relatively high COP of double-effect chiller and the diffuse component in the solar field, results in the most reasonable trade-off between energetic and economic performance of the system in a wide range of climatic conditions.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2287716980"}}

RESUMEN The article presents an analysis of technical and economic feasibility of using two configurations of solar cooling in a Cuban hotel. HVAC hybrid schemes are: a cooler of ice water vapor compression (chiller) interconnected in parallel with a smaller capacity chiller, first with a solar-powered absorption cooling system (SACS), and then with a photovoltaic cooling system(PSC). Both were simulated taking into account the weather conditions in the region, thermodynamic calculation methodologies and principles that govern these technologies. The results show that the use of these alternatives contributes to reducing energy consumption and the environmental impact of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC). Economic analysis highlights that PCS is more favorable than the SACS taking into account the cooling cost generation (CCG) but energy assessment indicates that SACS has higher thermal performance for the case study to which it is applied.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2339018340"}}

Limited non-renewable fossil energy reserves and the essential ideas of sustainability have caused an increase in the demand for solar energy. The intensified use of renewable energy in Germany is primarily encouraged by the German renewable-energy-law. Solar panels mounted on roofs generate electricity using the energy radiated from the sun by taking advantage of the photovoltaic effect. However, not every roof is usable for power generation through solar energy. Therefore, web-based solar energy registers for multiple regions in Germany have been developed that provide detailed information on roofs suitable for carrying solar panels. The analyses are based on a digital object model derived from airborne laser scanning data of high accuracy and a fully automated technology to classify the points. First, roof points are separated according to their single roof sides and are converted into polygons. Then, exposure, slope, size of the roof, and particularly shading effects are computed to calculate the solar potential of each roof side. The web-GIS provides detailed information about the roof's suitability, such as the installable capacity and the expected generation of electricity. Thus, it helps house owners to calculate their investment and later revenues.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2387295173"}}

Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) is one of the best ways to generate electric power using the solar energy, which is clean and inexhaustible energy resources. The most of BIPV modules have the form of GtoG (Glass to Glass) photovoltaic in building applications. Degradation leading to failure in photovoltaic modules is very important factor in BIPV modules. This paper analyzed the performance of various BIPV modules through outdoor exposure tests. Performance of three BIPV modules(c-Si type, a-Si type and DSSC type) with three installation angles influenced by sun light, outdoor temperature, and wind velocity was monitored and analyzed. As a result, c-Si type BIPV module outperforms other BIPV modules(a-Si type). In terms of power efficiency of the module, the installed angle of 45\u00b0 is better than others(90 degree, 0 degree). In addition, more realistic data of various BIPV system performance could be available through the field test and integrated building test.

Whilst there are growing interests in pursuing energy efficiency and zero-energy buildings in built environment, it is widely recognised that Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) is one of the most promising and required technologies to achieve these goals in recent years. Although BIPV is a broadly utilized technique in variety of fields in built environments, it is required that generation of BIVP should be analysed and calculated by external specialists. The aim of this research is to focus on developing a new diagram for prediction of the pre-estimation model in early design stage to harness solar radiation data, PV types, slopes, azimuth and so forth. The results of this study show as follows: 1) We analysed 162 districts in a national level and the examined areas were categorised into five zones. The standard deviation of the results was 2.9 per cent; 2) The increased value of solar radiation on a vertical plane in five categorised zones was 42\u33beh/\u33a5, and the result was similar to the average value of 43.8\u33beh/\u33a5; and 3) The pre-estimation of diagram was developed based on the categorisation of zones and azimuth as well as the results of the developed diagram showed little difference compared to the previously utilised method. The suggested diagram in this paper will contribute to estimate BIPV without any external contribution to calculate the value. Even though the result of this study shows little difference, it is required to investigate a number of different variables such as BIPV types, modules, slope angle and so forth in order to develop an integrated pre-estimation diagram.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2401975553"}}

A building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system is one of photovoltaic systems and can generate power while functioning as a boundary between interior and exterior space by building skin. In addition, the BIPV system has advantages saving costs for installing building exterior materials and PV panels, and can realize a low-energy building, which does not need extra space for installation. Architectural design adopting BIPV module to replace a conventional building skin should consider many design variables from the beginning. Thus, this research aims at proposing a way to make the best use of BIPV system, while conducting a case study regarding the application of BIPV system to building and reviewing the characteristics of BIPV module. This research about BIPV system can provide a clue to architectural design accepting BIPV system.

The increasing demand for nearly zero energy buildings is rapidly contributing to changing the design criteria in architecture and concept of the building envelope. Today, photovoltaics (PV) is one of the most reliable technologies for integration in the built environment, and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is introducing a different notion of \u2018energy integrability\u2019 into practice. The difficulty of undertaking, from the first design stages, a really integrative approach towards energy (PV and building requirements) is today still one of the strongest barriers to the rise of the BIPV market. Likewise, the same uncertainty affects the economic aspects, objects of this paper, since BIPV systems are often evaluated similar to conventional installations. The typical consequence is to neglect their added value such as the multi-functionality of the system and therefore showing limited advantages of BIPV. Scope of this paper, starting from a multi-criteria approach, is to outline a new methodology for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of BIPV for the building skin. This method, based on a life-cycle costing approach and on the assessment of the whole building envelope solution, is expected to support architects during the early design phase in the research of the optimal design of BIPV, synergistically taking into account both PV and building quality.

With the increase of both the number and size of installations, the attention to their impacts in terms of land-use and land-transformation is growing, as well as concerns about landscape preservation and possible losses of ecosystem services.

Abstract Shading systems improve building energy performance and occupant comfort by controlling glare, natural lighting, and solar gain. Integrating PV (photovoltaics) in shading systems opens new opportunities for BIPV (building integrated photovoltaics) on fa\u00e7ades. A key problem of such systems is mutual shading among PV modules as it can lead to electrical mismatch losses and overheating effects. In this work, we present a new modeling framework, which couples parametric 3D with high\u2010resolution electrical modeling of thin\u2010film PV modules to simulate electric energy yield of geometrically complex PV applications. The developed method is able to predict the shading pattern for individual PV modules with high spatio\u2010temporal resolution, which is of great importance for electrical system design. The methodology is applied to evaluate the performance of different dynamic BIPV shading system configurations, as well as its sensitivity to fa\u00e7ade orientation and module arrangement. The analysis shows, that there is a trade\u2010off between tracking performance and mutual shading of modules. Distance between modules is a critical parameter influencing the amount of mutual shading and hence limiting solar irradiation and electricity generation of PV shading systems using solar tracking. Planning of module string configuration, PV cell orientation, and location of bypass diodes according to partial shading conditions, reduces electrical mismatch losses and results in significantly higher electricity generation. The integration of parametric 3D and electrical modeling opens new possibilities for PV system design and dynamic control optimization. Though the analysis focuses on BIPV , the method is useful for the planning and operation of solar tracking systems in general.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2296522618"}}

In a low efficient PV system, the question like, How to enhance the efficiency of a solar PV panel with the optimum cost? persist. With the spectral sharing, the efficiency of a solar PV system can be increased. In this paper, a method has proposed to improve the efficiency by spectral sharing. Approximately 25-55% of efficiency can be possible with proposed method.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2494180227"}}

Abstract The objective of the present study is to simulate and evaluate a H2O-LiBr absorption cooling system driven with solar energy, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), to air condition low income houses in coastal areas of Mexico. To this end, an analysis of the behavior of the solar absorption cooling systems (SACS) was made using TRNSYS 17 with the purpose of obtaining an integrated system that meets the needs of air conditioning, with the smallest area of solar collection, and greater than 50% solar fraction. Two representative places of the predominant climates of the Mexican coast were selected for the study. These are the cities of Campeche and Acapulco. The results show that the SACS favors the air conditioning requirements of eight low-income households, generating favorable climate conditions between comfortable and slightly warm in extreme conditions, according to the standard norm ISO 7730 (2005). This is achieved through the use of a solar field of evacuated tube collectors with an area ranging from 207 to 220\u2009m2 according to the climatic region concerned (warm and dry vs. warm and humid climate), providing 60% of the power required by the system. This solar contribution was determined based on the results of the economic evaluation. Even though the area available on the roof of the houses allows a larger area of collection, the economic parameters as well as the return of investment period and the cost-benefit ratio, favored this proposal. Providing the houses with the service of hot water for sanitary use is also being considered, which makes the project more profitable.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1785313345"}}

The method takes into account the growing domestic energy demand and the possibility of meeting this demand through integrated solar energy collection into buildings using different systems. The methodology considers a study of the potential incoming solar radiation on buildings according to their geographical location and the surrounding buildings. The capacity for solar capture is then estimated for different dwelling types according to their morphology. Subsequently, the energy contribution provided by different technologies (solar thermal, photovoltaic and hybrid) is identified in relation to the main average energy demands for electricity, water and space heating. Finally, systems for each dwelling are recommended in an urban map available online. The development is based on climate information, cartography, aerial photographs, surveys, housing models, technical standards, standardised calculations and dynamic simulations, implemented according to building layouts from an online Geographic Information System (GIS). The housing types are categorised in an urban map that relates household demands and the contribution of different solar energy systems.

In order to help countries realize the importance of tapping into solar energy, it is crucial to reveal the potential amount of electricity that could be thus produced. For this reason, open data were used to produce an interactive web map of the global solar energy potential.

When used in cold environment, the conventional flat plate solar collectors and all-glass evacuated tube solar collectors will cause various problems, such as large heat loss, low efficiency, freeze and tube-burst, which severely limit their applications. In this paper, a special small-sized parabolic trough solar collector (PTC), which could overcome the shortcomings of conventional solar collectors, was proposed for water heating in cold areas. An experimental platform was developed, and extensive tests were conducted to evaluate the characteristics of the proposed PTC. It was found that the thermal efficiency of the proposed PTC reached about 67% even under the condition of solar radiation of less than 310 W/m2, indicating that the PTC could collect solar radiation efficiently. The results also showed that when the fluid temperature was under 100 \u00b0C, the thermal efficiency was improved with increased fluid temperature, due to the increase of Reynolds number caused by the great variation of thermophysical parameters of the heat transfer fluid (HTF), which resulted from the increasing fluid temperature. Both the frosting on the reflector and the ambient wind velocity weakened the thermal efficiency greatly. The highest thermal efficiencies were respectively about 26% and 56% under condition of frosting and wind velocity of 5.0 m/s. The comparison test showed the coated double glazing receiver had a longer temperature response delay to the deflected sunlight than that of the uncoated one. The tested PTC system operated normally in low fluid temperature condition, showing great anti-freezing property in cold environment.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2184352376"}}

Air-conditioning systems in Saudi Arabia consume approximately 65% of the electrical energy used in the building sector. Most air-conditioning systems in operation are of the vapor-compression variety. The use of solar energy to power such systems may save a large amount of electrical energy. Large-size commercial buildings in Saudi Arabia consume particularly high levels of electricity. This review compares three air-conditioning systems (conventional vapor-compression, solar LiBr\u2013H2O absorption, and solar photovoltaic (PV) vapor-compression) using a techno-economic analysis for a typical large-size building under a constant cooling load during daytime. The study utilizes the two economic methodologies, payback period (PBP) and the net present value (NPV), for a commercial building in Khobar City, located in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this paper is to exploit the results achieved in the analysis to develop viable recommendations in mitigating the electrical peak power demand in Saudi Arabia by utilizing solar cooling technology in commercial buildings as well as to establish the tangible economic benefits from applying such technology. The results show that a solar absorption system ismoreeconomically feasible than a solar PV-vapor-compression system.

The influences of some parameters on the performance of parabolic trough solar receiver are investigated in the present work.

The exergy losses of solar receiver increase as the inlet temperature of working fluid, wind velocity, and the inner diameter of glass cover increase. The convective heat loss of glass cover predominates in the heat losses of solar receiver based on thermal efficiency, but the exergy lost from absorber ends takes the largest proportion. The optical heat loss of solar collector is far more than the heat losses of solar receiver, especially in the larger solar incident angle. There exists an optimal mass flow rate of working fluid for exergy efficiency, and the thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency have opposite changing tendencies under some conditions.

Solar-assisted cooling technology has enormous potential for air-conditioning applications since both solar energy supply and cooling energy demand are well correlated. Unfortunately, market uptake of solar cooling technologies has been slow due to the high capital cost and limited design/operational experience. In the present work, different designs and operational modes for solar heating and cooling (SHC) absorption chiller systems are investigated and compared in order to identify the preferred design strategies for these systems. Three control scenarios are proposed for the solar collector loop. The first uses a constant flow pump, while the second and third control schemes employ a variable speed pump, where the solar collector (SC) set-point temperature could be either fixed or adjusted to the required demand. Series and parallel arrangements, between the auxiliary heater and the storage tank, have been examined in detail from an energy efficiency perspective. A simulation model for different system layouts is developed in the transient system simulation environment (TRNSYS, Version 17). Simulation results revealed that the total solar fraction of the plant is increased by up to 11% when a variable speed solar loop pump is used to achieve a collector set-point temperature adjusted according to the building load demand. Another significant finding of this study is that a parallel configuration for the auxiliary heater out-performs a conventional series configuration. The yearly performance of an auxiliary heater in parallel with the storage tank enhances the plant solar fraction, and the average collector efficiency, by up to 13% and 9%, respectively (as compared to the same components in series).

However, snow and ice formation on the exterior solar cell surfaces reduce their performance and may also lead to faster deterioration. Hence, if one could find a way to develop solar cells which were able to avoid snow and ice formation on their surfaces, one would have moved a large step ahead. This work presents a review exploring miscellaneous pathways for avoiding snow and ice formation on solar cell surfaces including superhydrophobic and icephobic surfaces.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2404065458"}}

The popularity of solar collectors in Poland is still increasing. The correct location of the collectors and a relatively high density of solar radiation allow delivering heat even in spite of relatively low ambient temperature. Moreover, solar systems used for heating domestic heat water (DHW) in summer allow nearly complete elimination of conventional energy sources (e.g. gas, coal). That is why more and more house owners in Poland decide to install solar system installations. In Poland the most common types of solar collectors are flat plate collectors (FPC) and evacuated tube collectors with heat pipe (ETCHP); both were selected for the analysis. The heat demand related to the preparation of hot water, connected with the size of solar collectors\u2019 area, has been determined. The analysis includes FPC and ETCHP and heat demand of less than 10 000 kWh/year. Simulations were performed with the Matlab software and using data from a typical meteorological year (TMY). In addition, a 126\u2013year period of measurements of insolation for Krakow has been taken into account. The HDKR model (Hay, Davis, Klucher, Reindl) was used for the calculation of solar radiation on the absorber surface. The monthly medium temperature of the absorber depends on the amount of solar system heat and on the heat demand. All the previously mentioned data were used to determine solar efficiency. Due to the fact that solar efficiency and solar system heat are connected, the calculations were made with the use of an iterative method. Additionally, the upper limit for monthly useful solar system heat is resulted from the heat demand and thus the authors prepared a model of statistical solar system heat deviations based on the Monte Carlo method. It has been found that an increase in the useful solar system heat in reference to the heat demand is associated with more than proportional increase in the sizes of the analyzed surfaces of solar collector types.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2539186885"}}

In order to reduce the investment and operation cost of distributed PV energy system, ice storage technology was introduced to substitute batteries for solar energy storage. Firstly, the ice storage air conditioning system (ISACS) driven by distributed photovoltaic energy system (DPES) was proposed and the feasibility studies have been investigated in this paper. And then, the theoretical model has been established and experimental work has been done to analyze the energy coupling and transferring characteristics in light-electricity-cold conversion process.

Results revealed that energy losses were high in ice making process of ice slide maker with only 17.38% energy utilization efficiency and the energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of ISACS driven by DPES were 5.44% and 67.30%, respectively. So the immersed evaporator and cointegrated exchanger were adopted for higher energy utilization efficiency and better financial rewards in structure optimization. The COP and exergy efficiency of ice maker can be increased to 1.48 and 81.24%, respectively, after optimization and the energy utilization efficiency of ISACS driven by DPES could be improved 2.88 times.

The environmental and energy problems that have arisen in Turkey because of the dramatically increase in energy consumption require the implementation of energy efficiency and microgeneration measures in the building sector which is the main sector of primary energy consumption. Since Turkey is highly dependent on exported energy resources, the basic energy policy approach is based on providing the supply security. In this regard, supporting for in situ energy production, encouraging the use of renewable energy sources and the systems such as microgeneration systems in order to meet the energy requirements of buildings would be considered as a key measure for resolving the energy related challenges of Turkey and dealing with the sustainability issues.

Aguacil, S. Lufkin, E. Rey. In view of the importance of urban renewal processes, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems can potentially provide a crucial response to the challenges of the energy turnaround. Functioning both as envelope material and electricity generator, they can simultaneously reduce the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions while providing savings in materials and electricity costs. These are precisely the objectives of most European energy directives, from zero- to positive-energy buildings. In Switzerland for instance, one way to achieve the objectives of the \u201cEnergy strategy 2050\u201d is to install PV systems to cover 1/3 of the annual electricity demand. However, despite continuous technological and economic progress, the significant assets of BIPV remain broadly undervalued in the current practice. Various obstacles (technology choice, small volumes, lack of information and good examples, etc.) tend to increase the costs and reduce the acceptance of BIPV solutions. The present paper is an integral part of an interdisciplinary research project. Focusing on the architectural design issues, it presents the first results of a representative case study carried out in the city of Neuch\u00e2tel (Switzerland). The approach involves four main phases (Fig.1): (i) archetypes identification, (ii) building detailed analysis, (iii) development of architectural renewal design scenarios, and (iv) multi-criteria assessment of each scenario (energy consumption, electricity production, cost-effectiveness, and Life-Cycle Analysis). The application of the proposed approach on a case study allows us to initiate the first step towards a holistic and reliable multi-criteria comparison methodology for BIPV-adapted solutions in urban renewal design processes in the Swiss context.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2502831428"}}

Instead of having students make life cycle assessments and introduce them to straightforward checklists to improve their product designs, we challenge our students to develop a critical understanding of sustainability and use multidimensional assessments. Sustainability is not just about environmental benefits but also about useful products and added value. This paper describes our educational approach in the photovoltaics practicum (part of the minor). Our objective is to illustrate how such a multidimensional assessment works in practice and how it has helped students to develop a more critical, systemic perspective on sustainability. Students are asked to evaluate a PV-powered product on its sustainability by assessing the technology, usability and the environmental impact. To date, over 150 students have followed the minor, which gives us a large database of multidimensional assessments on a wide range of PV powered products.

Case study of two neighborhoods in Neuch\u00e2tel. With the \u201cEnergy Strategy 2050\u201d, Switzerland is planning to gradually withdraw from the use of nuclear energy and consequently integrate a larger share of renewables sources. Among all types of renewable sources, photovoltaic systems are ideally suited for energy supply in urban structures. This thesis defines the potential of the roof-based photovoltaics for different energy scenarios in urban areas generated in the Geographical Information System (GIS). To evaluate this potential, the technical aspects like solar irradiation potential and available roof areas are combined with the analysis of the urban morphology. The latter consists of the urban context and system visibility analyses on the one hand and the social aspects analysis of photovoltaic installation on the other hand. The methodology is applied in two neighborhoods in the city of Neuch\u00e2tel presenting different urban morphologies. Each neighborhood has been evaluated by the help of the models defined in GIS. For each building, the models evaluate the solar energy potential, the available roof surface, the visibility level as well as the sensitivity level. Thereafter, based on these analyses two sets of energy scenarios are presented for each neighborhood. Despite the limits mainly related to the social analysis, caused by the limited number of respondents, the presented methodology can be used as a decision support tool providing the decision makers with important information about the level of photovoltaic integration based on the morphological or social aspects of the urban area. In other words, it gives the decision makers the possibility to choose the scenario definition method based on both their territory context and their needs for producing energy.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2291744872"}}

In this report, we compared the three main LODs according to the CityGML standard and evaluated the relative error of solar irradiation between them through four case studies in the city of Neuch\u00e2tel (Switzerland). Furthermore, we determined if the impact of an exact modelling of surrounding materials proprieties has an influence on the studied buildings irradiation.

In the 3D-modelling universe, the Level of Detail has a crucial role, as it is the case to assess the PV potential in urban environments using this kind of models. According to the CityGML standards, there are five levels of detail, going from the footprint (LOD0) to a precise model with inside and outside details (LOD4) as stairs and chimneys. For the subject we are studying, meaning the assessment of the PV potential, the inside details are totally superfluous. That is why we are going to consider the LOD3 model as a perfect model. But an LOD3 model costs a lot more to do than an LOD1 or LOD2. This brings us to the main question we will try to answer in this paper: Is it useful to do an LOD3 model, or are LOD1 and LOD2 models precise enough to assess the PV potential of a building, or even of a city? The second part of the paper will handle the theme of the shading effects. Indeed, the production of electricity of PV cells is affected when a part of the cell is shaded.

How much energy could we generate if PV modules were installed on all of the suitable roof area in the nation? To answer this question, we first use GIS methods to process a lidar dataset and determine the amount of roof area that is suitable for PV deployment in 128 cities nationwide, containing 23% of U.S. buildings, and provide PV-generation results for a subset of those cities. We then extend the insights from that analysis to the entire continental United States. We develop two statistical models -- one for small buildings and one for medium and large buildings -- and populate them with geographic variables that correlate with rooftop's suitability for PV. We simulate the productivity of PV installed on the suitable roof area, and present the technical potential of PV on both small buildings and medium/large buildings for every state in the continental US. Within the 128 cities covered by lidar data, 83% of small buildings have a location suitable for a PV installation, but only 26% of the total rooftop area of small buildings is suitable for development. The sheer number of buildings in this class, however, gives small buildings the greatest technical potential. Small building rooftops couldmore\u00a0\u00bb accommodate 731 GW of PV capacity and generate 926 TWh/year of PV energy, approximately 65% of rooftop PV's total technical potential. We conclude by summing the PV-generation results for all building sizes and therefore answering our original question, estimating that the total national technical potential of rooftop PV is 1,118 GW of installed capacity and 1,432 TWh of annual energy generation. This equates to 39% of total national electric-sector sales.\u00ab\u00a0less", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2469748088"}}

In this article, a process map defining which decisions regarding solar energy needs to be discussed in which design stage, is presented. With the help of this process map, more informed decisions should facilitate the implementation of solar energy in buildings. Our way of thinking about energy and buildings is changing; initially buildings were solely considered to be energy-consuming, future buildings will be need to consume less energy while producing part of their own energy [1]. One way to produce renewable energy on-site is by means of active solar energy. By doing so, It will reduce the impact on the environment and reduce the dependence on imported energy.

This thesis is on the \u201cIntegration of Solar Thermal Air Collectors on Building Facades\u201d. The main objective of this thesis is to study the performance of two solar thermal air collectors which were installed on the facade of a sample wall. The solar thermal air collectors were selected, designed and constructed within the context of this thesis. In these specific systems, the factors which influence their performance are many, so a thermal analysis was conducted, to study their behavior and suggestions were made on the ways to improve it. Initially, an introduction of solar energy is presented and the reasons why the scientific community is driven to develop and improve alternative methods of energy and particularly renewable energy resources is given. Then a literature review of the bibliography of the subject was carried out, where a number of studies which have been published to date and are associated with the subject of this thesis are examined. Subsequently, the different ideas, which came up through brainstorming sessions were presented, as well as their evaluation with the method of Cost \u2013 Benefit analysis. In this way the final selection of the particular ideas to develop is made. Following this, a study was carried out for the development of a thermal analysis model to examine in detail the behaviour of the two solar collectors. This is introduced in Microsoft Office Excel. Through this program, the best geometric characteristics of the two collectors were estimated, on which their construction details were based. The technical details of the two collectors were then drafted with the help of \u201cSolidworks\u201d program. Then all the stages which followed were presented, up to their final construction and installation on the wall. Furthermore, all the instruments which were used during the experiments were presented, as well as their accuracy. This is followed by the presentation of the complete experimental process and of the results from all tests carried out for the two solar collectors. The most important findings are that the collectors work at a relatively high efficiency of 70% and the amount of useful energy collected over a day is 333,07 MJ. Finally, a study was carried out, for the application of the two collectors on larger systems, and important comments were presented, based on the results of the specific small-scale units constructed and tested. The conclusions which were reached in consequence of this thesis are given, as well as several prospects of the use of the two ideas may be used in future applications.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2519914624"}}

An investigation into solar photovoltaic (PV) system control topology selection, when partial shade is anticipated in the solar array, is presented. As available area is maximised in Building Integrated PV (BIPV) systems, shading is an inevitable consequence. The presence of partial shading in a PV array leads to multiple power peaks in the power-voltage curve, due to bypass diode sections being triggered, and an increase in module mismatch losses in the array. A building energy design software, Integrated Environmental Solutions, is used to determine the shadowed area on PV modules throughout the year, incorporating the PV system location and geometrical models of obstacles around the array. Photovoltaic system topologies incorporate the following device options: central inverters, a power converter for each series string of PV modules, and a Module Integrated Converter (MIC). A model has been developed to compare a DC-AC parallel MIC configuration with a series string DC to AC power inverter configuration, for a commonly occurring shading pattern, and a simulation is used to compare the power delivered by the topologies. The model is broken up into the following stages: i) geometric modelling of array and surrounding obstacles, ii) solar PV power characteristic model as a function of temperature and irradiance, and iii) inverter efficiency model for each topology.

Nowadays the photovoltaic research is focused on increasing the performances, the durability and reducing the cost of production of solar cells, such as PV modules. These are the paromount fields to make photovoltaics more attractive for the energetic market. In this dissertation two of these aspects are investigated: the durability and the cost reduction issues. The fracture mechanics of the Silicon, the standard material used for the solar cells, is the main subject of the presented study. In the recent and next years the relevance of the durability studies is expected to increase more and more because of the developing of a new segment of PV, the building integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV). These new products incorporating PV modules in the building materials are curtains, walls, windows, sloped roofs, flat roofs, facades, shading systems and roofing shingles. In the new generation of BIPV systems, PV modules replace parts of the building structure, providing functional considerations and lowering costs. In this market the thin-film PV is the most promising technology because of its superior flexibility, minimal weight, and the ability to perform in variable lighting conditions. The issues of this particular PV market are not only the energy production but also the structural safety and performance in addition to architectural specifics as the shadowing. In this framework the durability, the degradation and new technology to achieve a cost reduction are of fundamental importance. In this thesis, experimental diagnostic techniques and interpretative models based on linear and nonlinear fracture mechanics for studying the phenomena of fracture in Silicon are presented. In particular the development and the use of techniques for the quantitative analysis of electroluminescence signals, for the detection of cracks in Silicon caused by thermo-elastic stresses, have been developed. The experimental results have been obtained during an extensive experimental campaign conducted at Politecnico di Torino. For the interpretation of the experimental evidence it has been proposed an original onedimensional electrical model for predicting the eect of cracks on the distribution of electric current. Subsequently, the electric field has been coupled to the mechanical, introducing an electric resistance located at the level of the crack and dependent on the crack itself. In parallel, a numerical analysis has been carried out, using the finite element codes FRANC2D and FEAP, on the phenomenon of peeling in mono-crystalline Silicon induced by thermoelastic stresses. This study, which can be very important in applications because it may allow the production of ultra-thin solar cells with a significant saving of material, is carried out in collaboration with the Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH), Hamelin, Germany. This process exploits the thermo-mechanical stresses due to the contrast between the elastic proviii perties of Silicon and Aluminium in line with earlier studies of the school of Harvard.

A power outage during an ongoing operation at a hospital could in the worst case be fatal for the patient and therefore hospitals is one of the areas in the greatest need of help. The UPS technology has come far but has not yet become a common part in electric system for hospitals in the region. It is in the topic of how to design a UPS system with solar power for a hospital in this region of the world that this thesis focuses on. A strategy is presented for how to design and dimension all major parts of a UPS system with solar power. The strategy discussed UPS topology, UPS system configuration, solar power inclusion, batteries, installation and future expandability. If the strategy is followed correctly an efficient solution can be found for the majority of all hospitals in the region. The strategy was tested and improved during a case study at Kolandoto hospital in Tanzania. In the case study a UPS system was designed and installed with the purpose to supply three operations theatres and the wards at the hospital. The UPS system installed was a decentralised system with hybrid UPS/solar units what functions both as a solar inverter and a UPS unit.

Limited fossil energy resources and the potential danger of nuclear power plants led to growing popularity of solar energy. In Switzerland, Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) is expected to be responsible for up to quarter of the energy production from renewable resources by the time of 2035. In order to protect the existing natural landscape, BIPV must be concentrated in urban spaces, which means that certain amount of existing building envelopes have to be turned into energy generators. There is a growing concern about BIPV retrofits because they may change the visual appearance of the existing city images to a large extend and/or in a negative way. In order to manage the potential visual impact resulting from BIPV expansion in urban spaces, evaluation methods should be able to measure it appropriately. Existing evaluation methods show insufficiencies for this purpose: either they cannot guarantee objectivity and continuity of evaluation standards throughout assessments of different BIPV projects, because their qualitative criteria are vulnerable to subjective preferences; or they only use formal design parameters to evaluate the visual integration quality of BIPV and therefore lack neuroscientific base. In order to tackle these insufficiencies, an objective evaluation method is proposed that is capable of measuring the BIPV visual impact in building retrofits in a quantified approach based on neuroscience knowledge. The assessment should be made in concept phase of the project, so as to identify the BIPV designs that have the least negative visual impact. The proposed evaluation method integrates saliency model, which imitates the mechanism of human visual attention, into assessment procedures. First, the probability of a BIPV installation attracting human visual attention in the respective visual scene is calculated quantitatively with the saliency model. Then the modifications of saliency values in this very visual scene before and after the BIPV retrofit are assessed. In the end, the modifications of saliency values are transformed into BIPV visual impact and objectively expressed as single values. The analyses are based on renderings generated from RADIANCE and programming in MATLAB. This method is demonstrated with a small case study that simultaneously serves as proof-of-concept. The proposed evaluation method is applied on a realistic case study: BIPV designs for a church roof. In total, 5 designs were developed with variations in BIPV installation location, roof coverage percentage, module size, PV material und design approach. The lowest visual impact value was induced by the BIPV design with the most careful and considerate integration approach, the design with the boldest integration approach obtained the highest visual impact value. The evaluation method proved to be feasible to a large extend. It is believed that the synergy between architecture and neuroscience can contribute to a growing understanding of human responses to the built environment. Hopefully the findings from this thesis can help in minimizing the negative visual impact induced by BIPV expansion in urban spaces, and also aid architects in gaining new understandings for visual aspects in architecture design.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2564934327"}}

As a result of decreased solar photovoltaic (PV) system prices, the Swedish PV market has grown rapidly the last few years, with the majority of new capacity installed in buildings. However, the market is still small and this licentiate thesis therefore aims to help facilitating for a continued positive development by adding to the knowledge about conditions related to PV in Swedish buildings. The thesis includes two separate studies. The first study describes how existing PV systems in Sweden are mounted. It comprises 444 systems larger than 10 kWp. A majority of the systems were found on rooftops and only about 10 % on facades. Most of the modules on steep-slope roofs were mounted parallel to the roof, while on lowslope roofs, tilted modules fixed to the roof were the most common, followed by horizontal systems. An increasing share of ballast-only systems on flat roofs could be seen. Historically, PV modules used as shading devices has been the most popular choice for facades, but in 2013, a majority of the facade systems had vertically applied modules. In general, the initial development of a Swedish PV market has been successful and there has been a smooth transition to more and larger systems on buildings. In many ways, this is thanks to a fully developed European market. The second study examines how the profitability of a solar PV investment is influenced by building-specific parameters as well as current economic conditions. Analyses were conducted for 108 electricity supply points in multifamily buildings and 16 in other buildings. First, PV systems were sized to give the highest net present values (NPVs) only considering fuse size and hourly demand matched to simulated PV generation. In a scenario with a 20 % investment subsidy, this resulted in positive NPVs for 56 % of the studied supply points. A scenario with tax rebates based on grid feed-ins resulted in a slightly smaller share of profitable systems. It was shown that this support scheme with tax rebate promotes relatively large systems compared to the subsidy, although with a much higher risk. In a scenario with both support schemes, nearly all systems turned out profitable. Also considering the orientation of existing roofs drastically decreased the share of profitable system among the multifamily buildings, while a large share of the systems in other buildings remained profitable.

Abstract This master thesis is divided into two parts. The first part deals with a general study of different energy storage systems. The second part deals with the possibility to store own-produced electricity from solar panels in a multifamily residential area. The purpose of the first part was to collect information about different energy storage systems in a general study, and examine their different functions, current status and future prospects. The second part had the purpose to examine the most suitable energy storage method of today for a multifamily residential area and examine if daily or seasonal energy storage is economically profitable with a system of own-produced electricity. The first part, the general study of energy storage is based on a literature study. The second part is based on a case study that included two multifamily houses in the district of Linero in the city of Lund. Data on the electricity production from solar panels was based on a solar panel system owned by Kraftringen Energi AB. Data for the use of property electricity was based own real values from Kraftringen\u2019s database. Furthermore, the examination of the economical profitability was based on the pay-back method, where the economic life expectancy of the planned solar panels was set to 30 years, which worked as a maximum limit of profitability of the pay-back method. The result from the general study on energy storage systems shows that energy storage installations in the world seem to increase and different energy storage methods has different prerequisites and properties. With different prerequisites and properties, energy storage systems must be chosen from intended type of application. The most suitable energy storage system of today for a multifamily residential is based on battery storage. The results from the case study show that seasonal storage is not economically profitable, with the assumptions made in this work. The sensitivity analysis shows that a seasonal storage is to be economically profitable; certain requirements need to be fulfilled. On the other hand, daily energy storage can be economically profitable if the imputed rate of interest is a maximum of 4,5 %, with the assumptions made in this work. However, the sensitivity analysis shows that the investment of solar panels and batteries only become more profitable than only investing in solar panels under certain circumstances.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2587161327"}}

Hekkert et al. published an article in 2007 with a description of an innovation system. A method has been developed for the execution of a innovation system analyses, taking that description in mind. This method is described in \u201cInnovatiesysteemanalyse voor beleidsanalisten. Een handleiding\u201d by Hekkert et al. in 2011. A TIS (Technological innovation system)-analyses gives the opportunities and barriers of a technology. The result of such an analyses is determining for the role Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO.nl) plays in stimulating the particular technology. The PV technology sector is performing well. According Huijben and Verbond (2013) it would even be valuable if the Dutch PV market would be taken as an example for future PV market growth. Within the PV sector, there are nowadays a lot of different techniques exploited. Because of the broad range of different PV principles, it is to be expected that a broad range of PV products will enter the market. One category of those expected products is building integrated PV (BIPV). Berenschot (2015) defines BIPV as follows: \u201cWe consider Building Integrated PhotoVoltaics, or BIPV, in this roadmap trace as the aesthetic and functional integrating of solar power generating functions with regular building elements. Here the building elements contains, besides the electricity generating function, minimal one functionality in the building shell. Besides that, it is the purpose to gain full integration. Aesthetic integration means in a lot of cases that the PV-function cannot be traced from the countenance of the building, or particularly an element where the attention is especially drawn to because of the aesthetical character.\u201d (Berenschot, 2015) The conventional PV products that are regarded BAPV (Building Applied PV), such as standard modules, are occasionally considered as ugly. Therefore, conventional PV products could possibly obtain a NOMyR (Not on my roof) status. Because of this societal barrier, generating of sustainable energy by PV will be less. BIPV should prevent this because the aesthetics are taken into account. If the government decides to pay extra attention to BIPV, it is handy to know if the attention is necessary and where exactly the attention is required within the innovation system of BIPV. RVO.nl is producing a TIS analyses of BIPV. For a proper TIS analyses it is essential to map the structure of the innovation system of the considered technology.

Generation of electricity by use of solar irradiation is today a very small part of the total electricity generation in Sweden. It is not necessary to build a great amount of solar parks all over Sweden to reach a higher level, it could instead be possible by using already existing rooftops. That is one of the situations that indicates the need of a greater knowledge dissemination, about today\u2019s energysystem and the technology of photovoltaics. It also exists a demand of knowledge about characteristic Swedish houses and rooftops. To convert the different kinds of rooftops to small powersources, there is also a demand of knowledge about installations that is possible to do with different kinds of photovoltaics. Although, solar power alone cannot compete with fossil fuels, but it should have a good possibility to reach a much higher level than what exists today. Wallenstam AB is anenergy-conscious company within the real estate business in Gothenburg. Their interests in renewable energy and their ambition to replace fossil fuel with more environment-friendly technology facilitated this cooperation.The first part of the report aims to get more and deeper knowledge about the subject photovoltaics and solar plants. The second part of the report aims to investigate what possibilities and impediments there is with photovoltaic installations at different kinds of typical Swedish houses. A planning work is made at three different types of buildings in the area of Gothenburg. One at an industry/office space, one at a modern apartment block and one at a central building in Gothenburg that has both apartments and commercialized activity. The goal is to find the most suitable photovoltaic installation to each of the three buildings, based on economic advantageousness, appearance and esthetic, and the possibilities with the technology of earlier installed energy systems.The report and the result are formed on the basis of literature studies, site visits at the buildings, measurements at drawings and satellite maps, calculations by hand and modelling in the software PVsyst. Many discussions with people in the solar energy industry were also held. To calculate the Levelized Cost Of Energy (LCOE) and to perform the sensitivity analysis, a web-based calculator was used. The web-based calculator belongs to the report El fran nya och framtida anlaggningar 2014. The main result shows that only two of the possible photovoltaic installations gets a LCOE that is competitive relative the comparative electricity price at 0,75 SEK/kWh. Installations with polycrystalline solar panels at Kvillebacken 3:1 and Molnlycke 1:1. The result also shows that the two installations with polycrystalline solar panels at Kvillebacken 3:1 and Molnlycke Fabriker is really competitive if the capital interest rate is reduced from 4 % to 2 %, or if the investment cost isreduced by 15 %. At the property Inom Vallgraven 26:8, the LCOE for all possible installations are over one Swedish krona per kilowatt hour, but an installation with solar panels at a central building like that could have a marketing value. It would also show Wallenstams standpoint for renewable energy, new technology and a sustainable energy system.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2724184923"}}

In this dissertation thesis will be presented for the first time in Cyprus a facade 90\u2070 installation with double skin photovoltaic system of 5kW which was implemented at SHS building of Cyprus University of Technology. The idea for intergrading photovoltaic panels in the building envelop for production and saving energy for achieving energy targets and energy reduction in buildings is the main goal for the upcoming years that the European Union has set. The research studies the prospect power production of the proposed system in comparison of a typical installation on a rooftop inclined by 30\u2070, its natural ventilation properties through the gap which it forms due to the installation, the aesthetic point of view and opinion of the public through a questionnaire prior and after the installation. Other researchers presented mainly positive results in similar installations throughout the world, with different climatology, temperatures, various photovoltaic panels, inclinations and other parameters. Results of the simulation regarding the facade installation showed power production of 5.307 kWh/a and performance ratio 0.804 comparing to the ideal installation to the rooftop produced 7.896 kWh/a and performance ratio 0.710. Through the questionnaire conducted it was proven that the aesthetics opinion of the public was positive with percentages of pleasing of the new installation and looks of the south wall was 84%. The recorded temperatures on the photovoltaic panels, behind the panels and the chimney showed that they are directly interacting with the current weather conditions and wind speeds which the installation endures. Concluding, the analysed data of the payback period of the installation with real financial data was found 7 years and finally assessed were the changes of the Energy Performance Certificate of the SHS building prior and after implementing the double skin facade installation from 423 kWh/m2/yr, carbon dioxide emissions 123,35 kgCO2/m2/yr and use of RES 0 kWh/m2/yr to 417 kWh/m2/yr, carbon dioxide emissions 121,56 kgCO2/m2/yr and use of RES 6 kWh/m2/yr respectively.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2728536773"}}

Infrastructure plays a crucial role in promoting economic growth and development of a nation. Since India adopted the strategy of developed countries to achieve rapid economic growth by accelerating industrial development a number infrastructural developments have been taking place. These developments have further widened the rural-urban divide. A large proportion of the population living in rural India still suffer from severe infrastructural inadequacies. According to census of 2011, only 45.9% of the houses in rural areas are said to be in good condition. While 47.6% of the houses are in livable condition about 6.5% of the census houses in rural areas in India are said to be in dilapidated condition. Grass, Thatch, Bamboo, Wood and Mud etc., are the predominant material in roof in 20% of the rural households. The domestic consumption of electricity has been growing at a faster rate compared to other sectors due to increased urbanisation, higher disposable income and changing lifestyles. However, electricity as a source of lighting is only accessible to about 55% of the rural households and a majority of the rural households suffer from inadequate housing facilities which have an impact on quality of living.

In Sweden, it is generally most feasible to install solar photovoltaics (PV) primarily for self-consumption, as long as there either is a large enough load when the sun shines or that over-generation is generously compensated. Currently there are two support schemes for PV: a capital subsidy and a tax rebate for grid feed-ins. However, the latter is not available for systems above.1.00A, thus making self-consumption highly important for these systems. This paper studies the profitability of systems connected to loads from 100 to 700 MWh, most of them above 100A. In particular, it compares multi-family buildings to other building types. Analyses were based on measured electricity use matched to simulated PV yield and current market conditions. Calculations were conducted with and without consideration of existing roofs. In general, the supply points in multi-family buildings had less favorable load profiles than the ones in other buildings, which resulted in lower self-sufficiencies as well as relatively lower profitability and smaller system sizes. The support schemes turned out to be crucial for the profitability in most cases, but not all. For supply points in other building types with loads above 300 MWh profitable systems were found also without a subsidy. Taking areas and orientations of existing roofs into consideration drastically decreased the share of profitable systems.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2740936935"}}

As one of renewable resources of energy, solar energy has great potential to be developed in Malaysia because the country receives 4000- 5000 W/m2 daily radiation and monthly average daily sunshine duration ranging from 4 hours to 8 hours. The utilization of solar energy would reduce dependency on the fossil fuel which its price keeps fluctuating and also creates environmental pollution from emission of greenhouse gas (GHG) such as carbon monoxide, CO and nitrogen oxide, NOx. Solar photovoltaic (PV) and Solar Water Heater (SWH) are examples of solar energy applications that could be used in Malaysia.Solar Water Heater uses solar energy to produce hot water needed in households. The objectives of this study are to simulate the transient heating characteristics of solar thermal collector, to determine optimum design parameters of the solar thermal collector system based on year performance under meteorological data of Penang, Malaysia, to develop a TRNSYS simulation model of the flat plate collector system and to investigate the effects of collector area and mass flow rate on outlet temperature and heat transfer rate of solar collector. Simulation using TRNSYS software had been done to investigate the performance of the solar water heater by using typical meteorological year (TMY) data for Penang, Malaysia. Results obtained from simulations shows that 8m2 solar thermal collector with 70kglhr mass flow rate is the most optimum parameters for the system. This is considering the cost for the solar thermal water heater system. Larger solar collector area will needs more cost for the system. The highest collector outlet temperature was achieved in January, November and December which is 80\u00b0C. The heat transfer rate in solar collector also highest in these months ranging from 22500W to 24000W. Increasing in mass flow rate resulting in decreases of collector outlet temperature.

Construction professionals are continually faced with the challenge of incorporating new technology into their buildings. Much of the current research treats innovations as a discrete entity, thereby overlooking the system properties of many innovations. Far from a bolt on process, implementation often involves extensive accommodation of both the technology and the building. Failure to appreciate this poses significant challenges to the project team, with unintended consequences for the project as a whole. A social construction of technology (SCOT) approach is used to explore the integration of Building Integrated Photovoltaic technology (BIPV) into three commercial projects. By exploring the succession of problems and solutions shaping the uptake of BIPV, the analysis also documents the mutual constitution of both the technology and the building in which it is located. The interest of BIPV lies in the bespoke, system nature of the innovation. Three decision modes are identified which help to explain how solutions can \u201clock in\u201d features of either the technology or the building, often at the expense of the desired outcome.

The increase in rapid industrialization for different development programs have created energy crisis for many developing countries. If this increase in demand will rely upon Coal based thermal power plants, it results in environment pollution and high cost of generation. So the best alternate solution is to develop plants based on renewable sources of energy in the country. The potential for renewable energy resources is enormous because they can, in principle, exponentially exceed the world's energy demand; therefore, these types of resources will have a significant share in the future global energy portfolio. The Renewable sources of energy include Energy from Biomass, Geothermal Energy, Hydro power energy, wind Energy and Solar Energy. Biomass can be explained as all organic material originating from plants, trees and crops, and is essentially the collection and storage of the sun's energy through photosynthesis. Geothermal energy is the energy contained as heat in the Earth\u2019s interior and considered as a cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly energy source. Hydropower is based on a simple process taking the advantage of the kinetic energy freed by the falling water and a source of clean energy and its generation is not linked to issues concerning fuel supply, especially the price volatility of imported fuels. Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics\u2019, solar thermal energy, solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis.

When using the integrated approach, solar systems become part of the general building design. In fact, they often become regular building elements. This is due to the fact that integrating solar systems into the building envelope is often a necessity if the systems are to be economically feasible. The solar elements cannot be separate elements that are added after the building, or at least the architectural design of it, is complete. Rather, they must replace other building elements, thereby serving dual functions and reducing total costs. The following case studies depict a coming-of-age of building-integrated photovoltaics (PVs). These PV elements are specially designed for glass shading devices. The PVs will serve as shading elements for areas protected by the new system. The overhanging shading roof provides adequate shade in the summer and allows for useful solar heat gain in the winter. These factors combined should help to keep the building\u2019s running costs to a minimum. In conclusion, the simulations and testing at the design stage show that the overall environmental strategy will reduce the building\u2019s running costs while optimizing visual and thermal comfort. Integrating PVs into the architectural design offers more than cost benefits; it allows the creation of an environmentally friendly energy-efficient building.

The analysis aimed to identify the relevant possibilities the products today offer and the level of information that the producers make available within the technical description of BIPV systems. After disclosing the actual lack of information in comparison to conventional building products, the authors propose to implement a new \u201cbuilding-based\u201d approach that could support the BIPV market by including a more comprehensive description of the product\u2019s quality (today mainly comprising electrical and basic physical features). Such a \u201cbuilding-technology\u201d perspective, also considering the recent normative framework in BIPV field, is expected to encourage the technological transfer of PV in the building sector by facilitating the daily work of architects, installers and the whole value chain.&lt;/p&gt;", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2285685757"}}

Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) refers to photovoltaic or solar cells that are integrated into the building envelope (such as facade or roof) to generate \u2018free\u2019 energy from sunshine, and it is one of the fastest growing industries worldwide. However, up until now, there have been limited studies that analysed cost\u2012benefit and risk factors/barriers of BIPV from a supply chain perspective; and there have also been limited studies that provide strategies to industry and academics in order to encourage BIPV diffusion and application. The aim of this research is to identify the costs, benefits and risks of BIPV and propose suggestions for greater BIPV application, from a stakeholder perspective, through a comprehensive review of current literature. The results of this research show that whilst BIPV have high initial investment capital costs, there are significant long-term benefits to be achieved for clients, end users and the entire society. Further, the results also show that BIPV costs decrease and government policy support and incentives are required in order to promote wider BIPV application. In addition, this research has identified the fact that there was a lack of detailed BIPV cost data (including individual component costs) and lack of methods for BIPV cost\u2012benefit analysis, and there are risks and barriers in BIPV applications. Following this, this research provides a strategic framework and a number of suggestions to industry stakeholders for integration and collaboration within the BIPV supply chain in order to facilitate the cost reduction of BIPV. Finally, this study proposes several topics for future research.

The technology behind a large area array of flexible solar cells with a unique design and semitransparent blue appearance is presented. These modules are implemented in a solar tree installation at the German pavilion in the EXPO2015 in Milan/IT. The modules show power conversion efficiencies of 4.5% and are produced exclusively using standard printing techniques for large-scale production. In this Communication, we present the technology behind the solar tree installation at the German pavilion, Milan EXPO, which represents a paradigm shift in solar technology, as it incorporates a large area array of flexible solar cells with a unique design and semitransparent blue appearance. The modules show power conversion efficiencies of 4.5% and were produced exclusively using common printing techniques. High performance organic photovoltaic (OPV) polymers have been recently reported in the literature, highlighting the potential of carbon-based semiconductors as a realistic source of power generation. OPV modules have the potential for extremely fast payback times for both energy, carbon, and cost versus other solar technologies.1-3 In terms of absolute device performance, 3rd Gen PV technologies are lagging behind approaches based on Si, CIGS, etc., but offer inherent advantages in flexibility, form factors, colour, transparency, lightweight, indoor efficiency, low-light efficiency, and off-axis performance. In the case of building integrated PV (BIPV), the inherent freedom of design and versatile adaptability allows OPV to better serve functional and aesthetic demands from architects as compared to classic PV technologies. Examples are the unique choice of colours, shapes, and degrees of transparency, which strongly improves the prospects to comply with preferred fa\u00e7ade designs, and the straightforward compatibility with upcoming membrane architecture due to its flexible nature.4 Approaching the production of modules via solution-based polymers also opens up cost-effective and scalable roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing techniques with low environmental impact.5, 6 PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 addresses many of the current technical challenges toward the commercialization of OPV that have been recently outlined9, 10 and offers a real alternative to P3HT. From a materials standpoint, PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 can offer up to 9% PCE on the cell level, establishing it as a top tier OPV polymer along with the PTB7 family,11-13 the PBDTBDD and PDBT-T1 family,14, 15 the PPDT2FBT family,16 the PffBT4T-2OD family,17 and recently DT-PDPP2T-TT.18 Most importantly, state-of-the-art progress from lab cell to fully R2R modules producing 4.5% power conversion efficiency (PCE) from semitransparent modules is demonstrated herein. This pioneering work has already shown the highest reported performance of flexible R2R modules of fully solution-processed single junction OPV design19, 20 leading to its first demonstration of flexible, semitransparent OPV modules integrated into the Universal EXPO in Milan, 2015.7, 8, 21 PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 is the outcome of polymer backbone optimization from our previously reported polymer system based on the PBTZTBDTT family, and is composed of substituted benzodithiophene, thiophene, and benzothiadiazole (Figure 1b).22 The \u201cR1\u201d and \u201cR2\u201d were selected from a library of polymers and simultaneously enhances solubility, power conversion efficiency,23 and device stability.24, 25 The result is a royal-blue polymer with a band gap of 1.7 eV and absorption peaks at 600 nm and 640 nm in the solid state. The frontier molecular energy levels of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 were measured by cyclic voltammetry at \u22123.7 and \u22125.4 eV. The molecular weight of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 is used to alter formulation viscosity to match the technique requirements of a particular printing or coating method. In the present case of doctor blade and slot-die coating, the molecular distribution was fixed at Mn = 22.2 kg mol\u22121 (Mw = 49.5 kg mol\u22121, \u0110M = 2.23).26 PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 is widely soluble in common organic solvents which are used for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) processing, including 1,2-dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, chloroform, o-xylene, 1-methylnaphthalene, tetraline, and mesitylene, amongst others.27, 28 High PCE can be obtained by optimizing formulations in any of these solvents although we have determined that mixtures of o-xylene and tetraline provide a good balance of PCE, solubility, fullerene solubility, viscosity and coating uniformity, while being entirely halogen free.28, 29 As clearly illustrated by Krebs and Jorgensen, a true demonstration of a commercial high performance OPV polymer can only be performed on large areas, by many laboratories, and using commercially relevant printing techniques.10 Our evaluation and optimization commenced on small area cells measuring 0.04 cm2. To facilitate the transfer from a lab scale process to a R2R process, ink formulation and device optimizations were performed using a doctor blade coating technique rather than spin-coating. Here we employed solution processable PEDOT:PSS as a hole-transporting layer (HTL, Clevios P VP AL 4083), PV-E001 as an electron-transporting layer (ETL, Merck), and 1,2-dichlorobenzene as a screening solvent for the standard architecture. Combining PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 with PC60BM (Lisicon PV-A600) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene with a solids loading of 30 mg mL\u22121 (1:2 weight ratio of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:PV-A600) allowed the fabrication of state-of-the-art regular stack OPV devices giving 9.3% PCE peak (8.5% PCE average, Figure 2). This is one of the few commercially available polymers which is currently able to produce >9% PCE using an industrially relevant coating technique, off the shelf solution processed interlayers, and PC60BM as an acceptor material. The EQE of these devices exceed 70% with a peak of 80% at 668 nm in the standard architecture. Exceptionally high FF are produced in the range of 74%\u201370% even at active layer thicknesses of 500 nm (Figure 3b). These performances can be consistently reproduced in our laboratory. The next stage in development was to transition to systems that would highlight any challenges of Lisicon PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 integration into commercially viable mass-produced OPV prototypes. It was therefore essential not only to measure the effects of moving to larger active areas and to plastic substrates in view of R2R OPV processes, but also to move from dichlorobenzene to nonhalogenated solvents for the active formulation in order to satisfy the requirements for industrial mass-production. In this case, work was carried out on both device architectures, the inverted stack being fabricated by using PV-E002 as the ETL in combination with PEDOT:PSS (HTL Solar Clevios 388). We combined PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 and PV-A600 (30 mg mL\u22121 and 1:1.5 weight ratio) in a mixture of tetralin (12.5 vol%) and o-xylene (87.5 vol%); the solvent mixture giving a suitable balance of solubility, performance, and viscosity.29, 30 Moving to large area devices produces additional losses from an increase in the series resistance across the cell, leading to a lowering of the performance.9, 31-33 Devices at 1.00 cm2 give peak PCEs at 7.5% (7.2% average PCE) for the inverted stack architecture. The main losses from the large area devices arise from a reduction in fill factor stemming from an increase in series resistance, for which the bottom cell design and conductivity are key contributors as highlighted by the difference between the regular and inverted stack behaviors at forward bias (Figure 2A). Inverted stack devices at 0.27 cm2 and prototyped on ITO-metal-ITO (IMI) coated PET exhibit a decrease in the overall performance driven by the Jsc compared to the equivalent device on glass (Table 1). PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 allows thick active layers to be coated, therefore compensating for most of the optical losses of the substrates, while maintaining high FF and PCE (Figure 3B). The final stage of integration of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 into modules was performed using a R2R process. The substrates are made of prestructured IMI on PET, and the HTL and ETL were PEDOT:PSS HTL Solar Clevios 388 and PV-E002, respectively. The HTL was customized in order to ensure printability on top of the BHJ and its compatibility with an additional transparent conductive layer (TCL) of PEDOT:PSS PH1000, helping current extraction when used in conjunction with a Ag grid electrode. The performances were first checked on cells measuring 0.27 cm2, which were cut out of the roll of OPV modules printed by R2R and completed using evaporated Ag. In this configuration, performances of 4.8% PCE can be reached from the opaque cells. This validates the particular architecture of the OPV stack and its processing by R2R, even if some losses in performance originate from the lower Jsc values. Those losses are attributed to the high thickness of the bilayer of HTL, which reduce the contribution of the evaporated Ag electrode to the Jsc by means of multireflection processes, and which can also change the light distribution in the BHJ. Moving from an evaporated electrode to an interdigitated Ag structure, the latter being needed to attain a semitransparent final product, leads to performances as high as 4.5% PCE prior to encapsulation. Remarkably, this BELECTRIC OPV process and design minimizes losses of the Voc and FF versus lab-scale devices, despite the stack being fully printed.34-36 In real world tests, these bifacial semitransparent modules are expected to exhibit a slight increase in efficiency by harvesting light from both sides.37 The modules consist of a combination of 54 cells in total, grouped as 9 serially connected cells, which are then connected in parallel (Figure 4). A record 4.3% average PCE for the module was achieved for this semitransparent system. The use of high precision laser structuring allows the increase of the geometrical fill factor (GFF) to a high level of 95%.34-36 This contributes not only to improving the module performance, but also significantly improves the aesthetic appeal of the final modules, which is key to delivering building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV, Figure 1).38 More than 250 m2 of modules, with an average performance of 4% PCE and an average transparency of \u224820% were fabricated for installation in the solar trees at the German pavilion in the 2015 Universal Expo in Milan. Besides performance, excellent thermal stability of the OPV modules is a prerequisite for their integration into many end products. For instance OPV elements embedded in glass (e.g., fa\u00e7ade elements) require stability for 2 h at 120 \u00b0C in the lamination process.38 Thus these conditions serve as good test standard and were carried out on inverted single cells on PET (same configuration as Type 4, Figure 3). The device was periodically measured during this test in order to track any changes in performance during thermal stress. After an initial 15 minutes of heating, an increase in Jsc is observed causing an increase in PCE while FF and Voc remain unchanged. Beyond the 60 minutes timeframe, a slow decrease in FF and Jsc result in a minor loss in PCE, reverting back to its starting performance of 5.6%. Overall excellent thermal stability is observed for PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 in this device configuration showing no significant change over 2 h of heating, thereby allowing for its integration within laminated supports. This result is attributed to the intrinsic thermal stability of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8, and to its incorporation into a finely tuned stack and solvent mixture. To validate the usage of the trigon modules under real conditions during the Universal EXPO in Milan 2015, light-soaking experiments of the systems were run under 1 Sun illumination without showing any significant decrease in PCE over the first 100 h. More data will be collected during the Universal EXPO and will be reported at a later stage. In the meantime, further engineering in terms of donor and acceptor materials and formulations are ongoing in order to enable any OPV market segments and printing processes with PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8. In conclusion, PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 demonstrates a combination of features that are essential for the integration into sustainable and adaptable commercial OPV products, such as membrane architecture applications or as laminates in glass-glass elements. On the lab-scale, this material offers efficiencies higher than 9% PCE, which is comparable to the best polymers reported to date. In addition to high performance, excellent processability is also critical when moving to fully solution-based, R2R fabrication of OPV modules: PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 is able to reach high performance with commercially viable acceptor materials, such as PC60BM and using a variety of coating technologies, broad thickness range, different cell sizes, and with formulations in a variety of nonhalogenated solvents. This unique combination of high optoelectronic performance and wide processing window enabled the fabrication of >250 m2 flexible \u201ctrigon\u201d modules reaching an average performance of 4.3% PCE, while maintaining a high level of transparency and aesthetic appeal. In real world tests, these bifacial modules are expected to show an increase in efficiency due to light harvesting from both sides.37 Furthermore, initial tests on the thermal stability of these OPV modules meet requirements for lamination protocols for glass-based BIPV products, thereby accessing the important market of fa\u00e7ade applications (in the context of the upcoming nearly-zero energy building directive 2010/31/EU). The large deployment of this material during the Universal EXPO 2015 in Milan is the first example of large-scale production of customized high performing solution-processable OPV systems, a clear demonstration that OPV is a viable technology to complement and contribute to the energy mix in a decarbonized global economy. Materials: PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8, PV-A600, PV-E001, and PV-E002 were purchased from Merck. ITO-patterned substrates were purchased from Zencatec. PET-based flexible substrates comprising a transparent conductive layer, namely an ITO-metal-ITO (IMI) sandwich structure, were purchased from Materion and used for R2R module fabrication. Clevios HTL Solar 388, Clevios P VP Al 4083, Clevios PH 1000, and the Ag ink used for screen-printing were purchased from Heraeus. The solvents as well as the metals to evaporate were bought through Sigma-Aldrich. Polymer Characterization: Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed at an elution rate of 1 mL min\u22121 with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (Aldrich) at 160 \u00b0C through a PSS polefin 10 \u03bcm (50 \u00d7 8 mm) precolumn and three PSS polefin 10 \u03bcm (300 \u00d7 8 mm) GPC columns. The polymers were analyzed with a refractive index detector calibrated with narrow polystyrene standards. Samples were prepared at a concentration of 3 mg mL\u22121. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded using a Princeton Applied Research VersaSTAT 4 potentiostat. Films of the polymers were cast from a concentrated chloroform solution onto a platinum wire working electrode. Voltammograms were recorded in an anhydrous acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M NBu4+ BF4\u2212 electrolyte with a platinum wire counter electrode and 0.1 m Ag AgNO3\u22121 in acetonitrile reference electrode. The solutions were purged with N2 gas and referenced to an external ferrocene solution which was also used to calculate the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) positions (Eorbital = \u2212(Eonset + 5.1) eV).39 OPV Cells and Modules Fabrication: All the devices at lab-scale were fabricated by doctor blade coating under ambient conditions. The only exception was the HTL in the regular stack, which was coated by spin-coating, under ambient conditions. Prepatterned substrates of IMI or ITO were cleaned with a sequence of successive baths in acetone, IPA, and distilled water. Substrates were then dried with compressed air. In the case of the small cell sizes in the regular stack architecture (0.04 cm2, type 1), the HTL made of Clevios P VP Al 4083 was filtered (PVDF coated, 0.45 \u03bcm pore size and 25 mm diameter, from Merck Millipore) and then added to distilled water in a 1:1 ratio per volume. The formulation was then coated by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 60 s to reach a thickness of 20 nm, and annealed at 120 \u00b0C for 30 minutes in air. The active layer formulation was made by mixing PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 with Merck PV-A600 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene with a solids loading of 30 mg mL\u22121 (1:2 weight ratio of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:PV-A600). The formulation was heated for 2 to 3 h on a hotplate at 90 \u00b0C under stirring, after which it was ready to be coated on top of the HTL. The coating parameters for the active layer formulations are: speed = 30 mm s\u22121, temperature = 70 \u00b0C, gap = 100 \u03bcm, volume = 70 \u03bcL. The film was dry after 2 minutes at 70 \u00b0C. The solution of PV-E001 was maintained at room temperature and a volume of 30 \u03bcL was coated on top of the BHJ by doctor blade at room temperature, with a speed of speed = 20 mm s\u22121, gap = 50 \u03bcm, after which a successive layer of Ag (100 nm) and Al (100 nm) were evaporated at a standard rate of 1\u20135 \u00c5 s\u22121. In the case of large cell size (100 mm2, type 2), a different solvent system was used composed of 87.5% o-xylene and 12.5% tetralin with a solids loading of 30 mg mL\u22121 (1:1.5 weight ratio of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:PV-A600). For inverted stack architecture devices (types 3 and 4), 140 \u03bcL of PV-E002 was coated by doctor blade from a formulation at room temperature at a speed of 5 mm s\u22121, a doctor blade temperature of 80 \u00b0C, and a gap = 575 \u03bcm, on top of the substrates. The BHJ was processed from a nonhalogenated solvent mixture as described previously and the HTL Solar 388 was coated on top by doctor blade from a formulation maintained at room temperature, with a speed of 30 mm s\u22121, a gap of 575 \u03bcm, and the doctor blade being at a temperature of 65 \u00b0C. An evaporation of Ag (100 nm) was then used to complete the stack. All modules were fabricated on a R2R machine as previously described.40 The machine comprises different un-winders, edge guides, backing rolls, IR heaters, impingement dryers, three slot-die heads, and one rotary screen printing unit. A camera system and a UV/VIS spectrometer were installed for quality analysis of the laser lines and coated layers. The IMI substrates, rolls of 165 mm \u00d7 150 m, were P1 structured with a Rofin 1064 nm Nd:YVO4 laser. PV-E002 was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature, the active materials in a solvent mixture of 87.5% Xylene and 12.5% Tetralin with a solid content of 37.0 mg mL\u22121 (PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:PV-A600 ratio of 1:1.5) was stirred overnight at 90 \u00b0C, and HTL Solar 388 and PH 1000 were stirred at room temperature for 2 h. PV-E002 was slot-die coated with a resulting dry layer thickness of 5 nm. The BHJ was coated with a heated syringe, tube, and coating head with a resulting dry layer thickness of 250 nm. Both layers were coated in one run with 2 m min\u22121 and additional drying steps were applied. HTL Solar 388 and PH 1000 were coated with a dry layer thickness of 70 nm and 150 nm, respectively, in one coating run at 1 m min\u22121. Afterward, P2 and P3 was laser structured with the above-mentioned laser and the semitransparent top electrode was screen printed from Ag ink with a dry layer of 6 \u03bcm. The final modules were roll-to-batch encapsulated between two barrier foils with the use of an epoxy glue. OPV Device and Module Characterization: The areas of the solar cells were defined by the area of the top electrode evaporated on top of the device. They were checked by optical microscope to avoid shadow effects. The Jsc values reported were extrapolated from EQE measurements (Newport). The solar simulator was a Newport 91160, giving AM1.5G irradiance and 1Sun intensity, as calibrated with a Si-photodiode (Newport 91150V). In the case of plastic devices and modules, current\u2013voltage characteristics of the solar cells and modules were recorded under a calibrated Oriel solar simulator with xenon lamp providing 1 sun (AM 1.5G, 1000 W m\u22122) by using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit in combination with a Keithley 7001 Multiplexer system. External quantum efficiency was measured with a custom-made setup. Absorption spectra were performed with an OceanOptics USB2000+. Thickness measurements were done by mechanical profilometry using a Dektak Alpha-Step 500.

In this work, the shading effect on the performance of two PV systems based on 3j-aSi photovoltaic modules on the fa\u00e7ade is analysed. There are 5 rows on the fa\u00e7ade of the building and two identical strings\u2019 energy rating values are compared. One string has only row shading but the second string has smaller shading. In this comparison it is found that energetic performances so called energy rating (kW h/kWp) values of the arrays differ 16% for an annual average between 10% and 24% monthly intervals. In winter months the shading effect is caused by the tree is less than 1% in the electricity yield where there is no row shading in winter months. But in summer months (because of the height of the sun) the calculated energy yield difference is about 15%. In 21st of June between 9.00 and 13.00 it is calculated that the output between the inverters is 15% where there is no shading because of the tree all shading is from the upper rows. PV data is collected with a Sunlog data logger.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) coupled with weather research forecasting (WRF) model and one-dimensional heat conduction model are employed. Under clear weather conditions, the installation of solar PV leads to cooling of building surface but specific warming may occur. During daytime, cooling effect is greater on the roof surface (2.1 \u00b0C) than on wall (0.8 \u00b0C) because of efficient thermal convection and greater sky view factor which leads to air circulation. During nighttime, cooling effect is greater on wall (4.3 \u00b0C) than on roof (1.4 \u00b0C) because of shading effect. Shading effect minimizes the heat absorption during daytime and hence minimizes heat release during nighttime. The reduced surface temperature leads to urban air cooling, up to 0.4 \u00b0C during nighttime. The installation of solar PV does not affect anthropogenic heat, however it can reduce sensible heat flux and increase net radiation as a consequence of surface temperature cooling.

Solar cooling based on water-lithium bromide absorption chillers is the most promising technology for low-medium temperature heat sources (80-100 \u00b0C). Small (15-40 kW cooling capacity), medium (50-250 kW) and large scale (up to tens of MW) units are currently at commercial stage. In the present work, the development of a novel micro-scale LiBr absorption chiller (around 5 kW) is presented. The objective is to demonstrate the technical feasibility and to investigate the performance under different operating conditions. A computer code has been developed to simulate a LiBr absorption chiller. The model computes mass flow rates, temperatures, pressures and mass concentration of LiBr-water solution in all the chiller components, both in design and off-design conditions. Giving as inputs inlet temperature and mass flow rate of the external circuits (hot water source, cooling water and chilled water), the computer code is able to evaluate the efficiency (COP) and the actual cooling capacity. The simulation code has been used to size the heat exchangers and to design a prototype of a micro-scale chiller. The chiller prototype with a 5 kW nominal cooling capacity has been manufactured and fully instrumented in order to monitor all physical quantities in the internal and external circuits.

Besides building integrated solar electric generators otherwise referred to as building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), which is aesthetically appealing and forms part of the applied building fabrics, most other options could deform the building aesthetics and require large spaces for both installation and operation especially, the wind turbine.

Thus, it has the strong point of increasing the economical efficiency by applying the PV modules to the buildings. Bifacial solar cells can convert solar energy to electrical energy from both sides of the module. In addition, it is designed as 3 busbar layout which is the same with ordinary mono-facial soalr cells. Therefore, many of the module manufacturers can easily produce the bifacial solar cells without changing their manufacturing equipment. Moreover, bifacial BIPV system has much potential in building application by utilizing glass to glass structure. However, the performance of bifacial solar cells depends on a variety of factors, ranging from the back surface to surrounding conditions.

One of the best ways of making efficient use of energy in residential units is to use heat pump. Heat pump performance can be further enhanced by integrating a solar thermal unit to provide hot water and subsidize space heating. This paper presents numerically examined energy feasibility study of a solar driven heat pump system for a low energy residence, where a flat plate solar collector served as the sole low temperature heat source. A parametric study on the ambient-to-solar fluid heat transfer coefficient has been conducted to determine the required solar collector heat transfer characteristics in this system. Solar collector area and storage tank volume were varied to investigate their impact on the system performance. A new performance indicator availability was defined to assess the contribution of the solar collector as low temperature energy source of the heat pump. Results showed that the use of a solar collector as low temperature heat source was feasible if its heat transfer rate (UA-value) was 200 W/K or higher.

These systems were installed at four individual houses with the same area of <TEX>$100\\;m^2$</TEX>. The monitoring results for one year are as follows. (1) The average daily operating time of the solar system appeared to be 313 minutes in spring (intermediate season), and 135 minutes and 76 minutes in winter and summer respectively. The reason for the short operating time in summer is the high storage temperature due to low water heating load. The high storage temperature is caused by a decrease in collecting efficiency as well as by overheating. (2) The geothermal heat pump as an auxiliary heater mainly operates on days of poor insolation during the winter season. (3) Despite controlling for total house area, hot water consumption varies greatly according to the number of people in the family, hot water usage habits, etc. (4) The yearly solar fraction was 69.8 to 91.5 percent, which exceeds the maximum value of 80% as recommended by ASHRAE.

In the case of designing Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) facade for achieving Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB), lack of tools, even for detailed design stages, means that architects cannot comprehend major added value of BIPV, energy production, with ease and having trouble to justify increase in the investment cost. Furthermore, lack of designed BIPV that have outstanding aesthetic prevents them from being object of desire.  This thesis proposes an expert system for early stage architectural design of complex BIPV facades, aimed to assist architects designing and optimising BIPV thus eventually approaching ZEB target. The system consists of two phases. The first phase aims to calculate and assign performances with the all possible angle settings for different BIPV products and store them in a Performance Knowledge Database (PKD). The second phase is related to the design process where tool that interprets the PKD information and, with the significantly reduced time for calculation and need for expertise, proposes optimal facade layouts to the user according to the previously set input criteria. The methodology uses parametric design framework, within Rhinoceros 3D design environment, to support the design versioning with the live updates of the design states performances and suggestions for improvement.

Buildings are expected to significantly contribute to the adoption of renewables, and mainly solar technologies due to largely unutilised roof space. A framework to assist the decision making process towards the optimal integration of solar energy in urban areas, with the focus on photovoltaic panels, considering spatiotemporal aspects, is presented using a village in Switzerland as a case study. Calculating the solar potential of the examined area is the first step towards determining the optimal structures to install photovoltaics. Utilisation of weather station measurements for the solar resource of a built-up area is prone to errors due to the complicated geometry of the built environment. Therefore, modelling in order to accurately determine the solar potential on a spatiotemporal scale is presented as the most promising solution. A workflow utilising Digital Elevation Models (DEM) is presented in order to create solar availability profiles for each building examined, taking into account the different surface orientations, the neighbouring structures, but also the surrounding topography. With the same techniques, the area availability for such installations is also quantified. In the next step, synthetic profiles for the electricity demand of the buildings are created taking into account the different building types. Having modelled the solar resource as well as the demand for electricity in the building stock of the examined area, the energy hub concept is employed to optimise the management of the renewable energy flows, considering multiple objectives. The energy hub output allows us to determine the optimal roof surfaces for solar installations that minimise the cost of meeting the energy demand and/or maximise the amount of solar electricity that can be used locally. Due to the intermittency of solar radiation and the temporal mismatch of solar availability and electricity demand, energy storage is also included in the energy system and its capacity is optimised to increase utilisation of solar electricity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1983571200"}}

In this case, the absorption machine is powered only by a solar collector field.

The models selected for evaluation were the Liu-Jordan, the Hay and the Reindl et al. models. There are studies evaluating such models, but evaluations were not performed for Central and Eastern European locations, only for regions with different climatic conditions. Present study focuses on the Central and Eastern European region with it's specific continental climate. In order to evaluate the models, a major city of the region, Budapest, was selected. In Eastern Europe usually only the monthly and yearly values of solar radiation are available and applied in engineering practice. However, in many cases more detailed data are required. Hence the aim of this paper is also to highlight the importance of available daily data for modeling. For solar collectors and PV panels, the optimal orientation is to the south and the optimal tilt angle is assumed to be approximately 45\u00b0 in the region. The calculated daily values were compared to measured data. The solar radiation was measured on a 45\u00b0 tilted, south oriented surface in Budapest.

The demand for energy efficiency of buildings and on-site electricity production is rising. Building integrated photovoltaic can provide a part of the electricity demand. Many studies are related to the module efficiency. However, architectural integration, optical and thermal properties also require attention. Semi-transparent modules are especially interesting for architectural integration in the glazed part of the fa\u00e7ade. Dye sensitized solar cells, offering color and semi-transparency, are in the process of market introduction. However, dye-sensitized solar cells are fragile and there are not many examples of architectural integration due to the technical challenge of introducing these cells in a glazing. A glazing containing colored photovoltaic modules could be used to design an active fa\u00e7ade. In order to determine the thermal behaviour of the building, the precise optical and thermal properties of the used materials need to be known. Performances of semi-transparent photovoltaic modules based on dye-sensitized solar cells were investigated. These modules come from the same manufacturer, using the same technology. However, they differ in terms of shades and nuances. Common practice is to indicate optical properties at normal angle of incidence. Yet, for most latitudes, the properties for a large range of angles of incidence are more relevant. Therefore, the spectral transmittance and the reflectance were measured at 12 angles of incidence ranging from 0\u00b0 to 75\u00b0. From these data, the solar direct transmittance \u03c4e, the solar direct reflectance \u03c1e and the visible transmittance \u03c4v and selectivity were calculated. The solar gain factor was determined on a prototype double glazing under illumination with a solar simulator by measuring the temperatures of the external and inner surface of the product. Combined with the values of absorptance obtained from the transmittance and reflectance values, this measurement allows us to determine the internal heat transfer coefficient qi and thus the solar gain factor of the double glazing (also called total energetic transmittance or g-value). Final performance of a fa\u00e7ade containing these modules will depend on the composition of the double glazing in which they will be laminated. The performance of the module itself will help to determine the best composition for each climate. For instance, a solar protection coating may be needed. The modules can be laminated to a glass pane and then be assembled in a double glazing. Therefore the architectural integration is facilitated and compatible with existing fa\u00e7ade systems. In highly glazed building, a part of the fa\u00e7ade could then be a photovoltaic fa\u00e7ade and deliver a fraction of the energy demand while providing colourful options to enhance the aesthetic of the building.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2224453011"}}

In the last few years, Renewable Energy Sources (RES) have come to the forefront as the most alternative energy supply instead of conventional energy sources due to the impacts of climate change, economic instability and variable political conditions.  In the present thesis, the current global energy situation and the perspective over the next years up to 2050 are analyzed. Parameters such as: environment and climate change, population, food and water stocks, world economy and their development are studied. The contribution of renewable energy sources to the energy sector is recognized and the use of solar energy and the other renewable sources for energy demand in 2050 is analyzed. Data from official international bodies are recorded and categorized as to forms of RES studied. The study is focused on European countries and our country, and the solar energy sector is analyzed. More specifically, parameters which influence the development, spread and use of solar radiation converting technologies into heat and electricity, the special features of these technologies and their applications in building, transport and productive sector. Some new designs of building integrated RES, investigated at the Solar Energy Laboratory are suggested, aiming to achieve zero energy buildings, regarding new buildings, and buildings with low energy consumption, regarding existing buildings.

Solar air-conditioning (AC) is an attractive AC system but it has intermittent output, and therefore, a conventional heater is needed as a backup. This study presents the effect of ratio of heat delivered by solar (Qsolar) to the total heat delivered to an adsorption chiller (Qsolar + Qheater) or solar fraction (SF) on the economic and environmental performance of a solar AC. This solar AC is not a solar-assisted AC, and therefore, it needs to fully cover the cooling load. The cooling demand of an office building in Kuala Lumpur, and the performance of flat-plate collectors and the adsorption chiller were calculated by equest and watsun software and by a mathematical model, respectively. Economic performance was analyzed by life-cycle cost analysis, whereas the environmental performance was analyzed by using typical emissions rate of energy systems used. It was found that a boiler was a better solution than an electric heater as a backup heater. Furthermore, the net profit (NP) at lower SF was higher because of its lower capital investment, but more emissions were released compared to the conventional AC because of the boiler operation. Thus, when economic and environmental performance were fairly considered, it is appropriate to have solar AC with an SF around 0.74.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2185128022"}}

Abstract Building integrated and building attached photovoltaic ( BIPV , BAPV ) systems may suffer from lower performance than predicted as a result of unwanted partial shading. New system architectures have been proposed to optimize performance. The common approach of these new architectures is to track the maximum power point of every solar module individually. This paper demonstrates the effect of shading on energy yield by evaluating power level management on the module level compared to string level. Three independent PV systems were installed and extensively monitored in Eindhoven, a reference string inverter system, a power optimizer system and a micro inverter system. The DC and AC performance ratio ( PR ) of the systems have been analyzed for different weather types based on the clearness index. A pole shading covering 1\u20132% of the total system surface has been used to evaluate system performance under a specific type of partial shading. Module Level Power Electronics ( MLPE ) is capable of increasing the PR up to 35% under certain partial shading conditions.

The use of photovoltaic (PV) is not anymore an option but a real need in the construction of nearly zero energy buildings. To date, the lack of PV products specifically designed for building integration, considering aesthetics and architectural aspects, is one important limiting factor allowing a massive deployment of PV in the built environment. Architects are continuously asking for new solutions to customize the colour of PV elements to better integrate them into the building skin. Among these colours, white is especially attractive as it is widely used in architecture for its elegance, versatility and fresh look. Until now, white solar modules were not considered to be an option and even never been though to be a technological possibility. Nonetheless, CSEM recently developed a new technology to make white solar modules a reality. Furthermore, the new Swiss company called Solaxess is now working on the industrialisation of this very innovative technology and the first products are expecting to be on the market at the end of 2015. The technology is based on the combination of two different elements: a solar cell able to convert solar infrared light into electricity and a selective filter which reflects and diffuse the whole visible spectrum. Any PV technology based on crystalline silicon can be used as they have a good response in the infrared. Approximately 55% of the current generated under standard test conditions comes from the infrared leading to conversion efficiencies above 11%. We will demonstrate, that thanks to this very innovative technology PV modules can become attractive and real active building elements and therefore meets the requirements of any future energy management through advanced building skins.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2186038303"}}

A building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) system is designed to produce electric power for a building itself by allowing its envelope to serve as a boundary between the areas inside and outside the building. This photovoltaic power generation system helps save on expenses for the installation of exterior cladding and PV panels and provides a way to create a low-energy building structure where no separate space is required for its installation. Therefore, a variety of different architectural design parameters should be taken into account to design BIPV modules that replace building envelopes. This study reviews how a BIPV system is applied during the early stages of building design and how BIPV modules are characterized and aims to propose a design plan regarding the use of building envelopes for the BIPV system to apply to building exteriors as a more active design element. Further, this work conducts a case analysis of BIPV systems to elicit the elements that are considered necessary for architectural planning and predict how they will be used to promote the dissemination and application of BIPV systems.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2270026398"}}

In this study, we carried out the performance evaluation on energy production and use of solar water heating system installed in a nursery school in summer season. The results showed the energy savings expected from the application of the solar water heating systems despite the irregular energy production due to the effect of the weather. As a result, the energy production of the solar water heating system was greatly dependent on the weather conditions and solar radiation. Collector efficiency refers to the changing production of the collector by the solar radiation, which is affected by the weather conditions, and the collector efficiency curve shows the variations, for which the solar radiation was the greatest influencing factor.

Austin SHINES aimed to demonstrate the solution\u2019s methodology would enable the DER grid ecosystem to serve load at a technical cost (System Levelized Cost of Electricity, or System LCOE) of less than the U.S. Department of Energy SHINES program metric of $$0.14/kWh, in a defined boundary, while enabling a high penetration of distributed PV. Research was categorized in 6 reports (Final Deliverables = FD) listed below, with titles and descriptions indicating which area of understanding was investigated: FD-1: System Levelized Cost of Electricity (System LCOE) Methodology The creation and use of the System LCOE to Serve Load metric that encompasses the holistic, system-level costs and benefits of all resources, and enables them to be evaluated based on their ability to support an efficient and low-cost integrated grid ecosystem. FD-2: Software Platform Product Description The creation of new DER control methodologies deployable within a utility-grade software platform that enable DER's to maximize their benefit within a grid, that is capable of serving load enabling a high penetration of distributed PV generation. FD-3: Optimal Design Methodology Optimal design methodologies for individual DER installations that enable utilities to determine the optimal combinations and sizing for individual DER sites. FD-4: Austin SHINES Ownership and Operation Models for DER System Performance A comparison of multiple DER aggregation and ownership methodologies including direct utility control, third-party aggregator, and autonomous. FD-5: Economic Modeling & Optimization A comparison of multiple DER technology mixes and configurations within the distribution system, providing insight into an optimal blend of technologies that best enable the distribution system to serve load at the lowest cost at high penetrations of solar. FD-6: Fielded Assets Deployed DER assets within the Austin Energy SHINES circuits. Austin SHINES provided an opening for state-of-the-art technology products to be deployed, providing a rich opportunity for improving how each of the products perform as stand-alone products, and in concert with other complementary products. The Austin SHINES project comprised of two key metrics for System LCOE: SystemLCOE_SHINES<$$0.14/kWh Modeled \u0394SystemLCOE_SHINES/\u0394SystemLCOE_Base\u226520% at same solar penetration The System LCOE calculation uses the costs of the utility-owned infrastructure as it exists today, the cost of the DERs that exist in the system today, and the cost of the purchase of energy from ERCOT wholesale markets over the course of the calendar year. All costs are on an annualized basis. The capital and operating costs are derived from the rate case, which produces a yearly cost. The net cost of energy and services imported to the system is integrated over the test year, as is the load served and solar penetration. The first metric was easily achieved by every scenario considered. The goal was set when the Department of Energy\u2019s SHINES Funding Opportunity Announcement was written in 2015 and was a more difficult target at the time. Due mostly to rapidly declining costs for DERs and the significant decrease in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) energy market prices, which results in lower net cost of energy purchases, the System LCOE is well below this target for all scenarios considered. A fleet of DERs can assume different mixtures, each of which serves the load at a different LCOE. The optimal mixture of DERs serves load at the smallest System LCOE. The second metric (hereinafter %delta metric) asks that the holistic DERMS controls reduce the incremental cost above the baseline of going to a high solar penetration future by at least 20% as compared to the case of a DER deployment with no sophisticated controls (autonomous). Many comparison sets were created throughout this project. Physical technology was installed for informing utility engineering and testing several types of operational control schemes, through the DERMS. The types of operational control which were compared for valuation of the System LCOE Metric were: Holistic control = using the full suite of the DERMS platform to decide and optimize how/why the systems operate depending on weather, market, and reliability signal input.

All of these resources were to be integrated and optimized at the utility level. DER assets and control methodologies were designed to achieve a credible pathway to a System LCOE for energy delivered to load of $0.14//kWh or less by 2020, while maximizing distributed solar generation and maintaining acceptable standards of power quality. The project also established a template for other regions to follow, to maximize the adoption of distributed solar PV in support of an economic and efficient grid. In total, the Austin SHINES project added value to the DER subject area in each layer of integration. From utility, to commercial to residential scales, the sheer hierarchy of communication and coordination was a significant accomplishment in addition to learnings from what these communications revealed was unique to each. Economically, the most effective method demonstrated was the criticality of planning phases. Contingencies and multiple projection scenarios helped guide the project to deploy optimal design as close as feasible, in real world conditions. The project and reports will serve public benefit by outlining specific areas of DER strategy and installation where many stakeholders and needs can be addressed with improved efficiency. Overall, communities and utilities should use the results to guide the increasing options available for powering the grid with DER, renewables, and carbon considerate energy.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4251200376"}}

Solar thermal water heating is most cost effective when applied to multifamily buildings and some states offer incentives or other inducements to install them. However, typical solar water heating designs do not allow the solar generated heat to be applied to recirculation losses, only to reduce the amount of gas or electric energy needed for hot water that is delivered to the fixtures. For good reasons, hot water that is recirculated through the building is returned to the water heater, not to the solar storage tank. The project described in this report investigated the effectiveness of using automatic valves to divert water that is normally returned through the recirculation piping to the gas or electric water heater instead to the solar storage tank.

Therefore it is necessary to take a solar photovoltaic (PV) without battery storage into account on evaluating a PQ problem.

In this paper, electrical PQ measurements and harmonic levels of rooftop solar PV integration are presented. The PQ measurements were set up on a distribution network which supplied a nonlinear load individually and whenever a PV system is interconnected with it. As is known, the level of harmonics depend on the performance of a PV system inverter. Since IEEE 1547-2003 standard applies to the measurement results, it is revealed that a PV system inverter is not meeting the standard.

This project included the construction of solar electricity generation facilities (40kW) at two Clark County facility sites, Desert Breeze Recreational Center and Hollywood Recreational Center, with educational kiosks and Green Boxes for classroom instruction. The major objectives and goals of this Solar Project include demonstration of state of the art technologies for the generation of electricity from solar technology and the creation of an informative and educational tool in regards to the benefits and process of generating alternative energy. Clark County partnered with Anne Johnson (design architect/consultant), Affiliated Engineers Inc. (AEI), Desert Research Institute (DRI), and Morse Electric. The latest photovoltaic technologies were used in the project to help create the greatest expected energy savings for60443 each recreational center. This coupled with the data created from the monitoring system will help Clark County and NREL further understand the real time outputs from the system. The educational portion created with AEI and DRI incorporates material for all ages with a focus on K - 12. The AEI component is an animated story telling the fundamentals of how sunlight is turned into electricity and DRI\u2018s creation of Solar Green Boxes brings environmental education into the classroom. In addition to the educational component for the public, the energy that is created through the photovoltaic system also translates into saved money and health benefits for the general public. This project has helped Clark County to further add to its own energy reduction goals created by the energy management agenda (Resolution to Encourage Sustainability) and the County\u2019s Eco-initiative. Each site has installed photovoltaic panels on the existing roof structures that exhibit suitable solar exposure. The generation systems utilize solar energy creating electricity used for the facility\u2019s lighting system and other electrical requirements. Unused electricity is sent to the electric utility grid, often at peak demand times. Educational signage, kiosks and information have been included to inform and expand the public\u2019s understanding of solar energy technology. The Solar Green Boxes were created for further hands on classroom education of solar power. In addition, data is sent by a Long Term PV performance monitoring system, complete with data transmission to NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory), located in Golden, CO. This system correlates local solar irradiance and weather with power production. The expected outcomes of this Solar Project are as follows: (1) Successful photovoltaic electricity generation technologies to capture solar energy in a useful form of electrical energy. (2) Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation resulting from reduced energy demand from traditional electricity sources such as fossil fuel fired and nuclear power plants. (3) Advance the research and development of solar electricity generation. (4) The education of the general public in regards to the benefits of environmentally friendly electricity generation and Clark County\u2019s efforts to encourage sustainable living practices. (5) To provide momentum for the nexus for future solar generation facilities in Clark County facilities and buildings and further the County\u2019s energy reduction goals. (6) To ultimately contribute to the reduction of dependence on foreign oil and other unsustainable sources of energy. This Solar Project addresses several objectives and goals of the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Solar Energy Technology Program. The project improves the integration and performance of solar electricity directly through implementation of cutting edge technology. The project further addresses this goal by laying important ground work and infrastructure for integration into the utility grid in future related projects. There will also be added security, reliability, and diversity to the energy system by providing and using reliable, secure, distributed electricity in Clark County facilities as well as sending such electricity back into the utility electric grid.

The heat pipe augmented solar wall operates much more efficiently for domestic air heating than alternative passive solar technologies. The thermal diode effect of heat pipes reduces the insulating losses of the unit during nighttime and adverse solar conditions. The exceptionally high conductivity of heat pipes allows for much greater heat gains, and significantly reduces the response time of the unit. The response time is also reduced by a smaller thermal mass of preheating components, which allows the system to passively alternate between insulating and heating conditions much more quickly. By separating the thermal mass of the system from external cold temperatures through the use of insulation and heat pipes, the insulation values of the unit are larger than that of other passive devices. A heat pipe augmented solar wall was designed with emphasis on thermal efficiency and mass manufacturing techniques. Design drafts, solid models, and assembly and production instructions were created to assist and spur future production of these units. Detailed consumer and producer economic analysis of the unit was also performed. The cost of the approximately four foot wide by seven foot tall domestic heating unit to be produced, shipped, and installed is projected to be $1580 with current tax credits. Economic analysis yielded a payback period of 14 years and a 30 year return on investment of 130% based on Louisville, KY weather and East Central United States utilities. A full-scale experimental heat pipe augmented solar wall was constructed as close as possible to the mass production design and was installed in a classroom at the University of Louisville. The unit was tested under actual weather conditions from April 1-21, 2009. Weather conditions for testing included clear, cloudy, rainy, and snowing and outside temperatures ranged from 4-24 degrees Celsius.

The one dimensional heat transfer, thermal diode effect of heat pipes makes them ideal for passive solar applications. Gains in a heat pipe passive solar wall are not lost during cloud cover or periods of low irradiation. An experimental model was built to test the performance of a heat pipe passive solar wall in a laboratory setting. Experimental variations included varying fluid fill levels and the addition of insulation along the adiabatic section of the heat pipe. Filling the heat pipe to 120% volume of the evaporator section and insulating the adiabatic section achieved efficiencies of 85%. The average rate of water tank temperature change for 80%, 100%, 120%, and 140% fill levels was 1.153\u00b0C/hr, 1.195\u00b0C/hr, 1.227\u00b0C/hr, and 1.203\u00b0C/hr, respectively. The addition of fins along the condenser of the heat pipe did not significantly enhance the overall performance. A computer model was constructed to simulate the performance of direct gain, indirect gain, and integrated heat pipe passive solar systems in different climates. The locations selected include: Louisville, Kentucky; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Madison, Wisconsin; and Rock Springs, Wyoming. Integrated heat pipe systems performed better than their direct and indirect gain counterparts in all climates. The water wall indirect gain system outperformed concrete wall systems in all climates. The lowest solar fractions were achieved by the direct gain system in all climates except Albuquerque, New Mexico (sunny and cool). The mild temperatures and cloudiness of Louisville, Kentucky provided an excellent climate for passive solar systems. Passive solar systems in Louisville (cloudy and cool) performed better than Madison, Wisconsin (cloudy and cold) and Rock Springs Wyoming (sunny and cold). Integrated heat pipe wall design variations were analyzed to achieve the best overall performance. These variations included: glazing thickness, extinction coefficient, absorber plate and heat pipe material, selective surface, insulation thickness, and water tank size. Decreasing the thickness of the glazing by 7.15 mm improved the solar fraction by 2.69%. Changing from a greenish cast glass to a low iron glass reduces the extinction coefficient and improves solar fraction by 8.82%. Switching absorber plate and heat pipe material from copper to aluminum reduces cost and decrease the solar fraction by 2.23%. Having the absorber plate electroplated with a black chrome surface opposed to painting the collector with flat black paint increase the solar fraction from 19.28% to 48.36%. Changing the insulation thickness around the collector improves the overall losses of the collector. Raising the R-value by a factor of 5 improved the solar fraction by 0.12%. Increased water tank size improves solar fraction but increases the units weight. Validation of the computer model was made by simulating the laboratory experiments and comparing the data. Temperatures across the system were matched by adjusting the calculated conductances. The computer simulation was able to graphically match the measured temperatures of the experiment. Conduction between the evaporator and condenser sections of the heat pipe was only 6% of the calculated value. An economic assessment was then performed to analyze the overall cost of the unit, deliver design recommendations, optimize cost, complete life cycle costing and calculate payback period. The most cost effective design would incorporate an aluminum absorber plate with four heat pipes. The solar glazing would have one cover and be made with low iron glass (3/32nd inch thick). For the city of Louisville with a load to collector ratio of 10 W/m2K the total cost of the unit would be $1825.46 for a collector area of 2.43 m2 (26.12 ft2).

The recent growth rate of  PV industry and market is phenomenal, with asubstantial surge on average over 40%  recorded globally during the last decade and expected to sustain the trend from short  to medium time frame. During the early developmental phase of c-Si PV technology, the  continuous feedstock support offered by Si-based electronics industry played a key role in  its growth. The high purity and even second-grade wafer materials obtained at arelatively  cheaper price proved favorable for PV industry as they led to areasonable ef\u008eciency (\u03b7) \u008egures for standard size modules (average \u03b7>16%\u201318%) and extremely good performance  stability (more than 25\u00a0years) that are two essential requirements for any technology to  successfully demonstrate its potential for market (Chopra et\u00a0al. 2004; Jager-Waldau 2004).  However, continuously increasing demand for PV modules and the need for low-cost PV  options in the last decade had stretched these advantages to the limit and had exposed  some inherent disadvantages of c-Si technology, such as the scarcity of feedstock material,costly processing of materials and device fabrication steps, as well as the inability  for monolithic interconnections. These, in turn, had restricted the potential of Si wafer  technology and made it dif\u008ecult to achieve PV module production cost below \u20ac1/W (1\u20ac is  about U.S. $1.35), which was considered essential for cost-competitive generation of solar  electricity (Hegedus and Luque 2003; von Roedern et\u00a0al. 2005; Zweibel 2000).

In residential and industrial areas, there are few buildings, which experience reduced solar radiation on their roofs due to lower building coverage ratio. However, in the city center and in the residential areas, several buildings experience reduced amount of solar radiation on their roofs due to the effect of shadows by surrounding buildings. In the wide north\u2013south and east\u2013west streets, solar radiation on the walls is not reduced, because the heights of the buildings along the main street are aligned. In the narrow north\u2013south streets, solar radiation on the walls is reduced when the opposite building is higher than the building in question. In the narrow east\u2013west streets, solar radiation on the south side walls is not reduced due to the high solar altitude.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1476720042"}}

However, it is hard to decide whether using BIPV system or not for architects and builders who are not professional at BIPV system because performance of system is considerably influenced by types of module, installation position, installation methods and so on.

In addition, it is designed as 3 busbar layout which is the same with ordinary mono-facial solar cells. Therefore, many of the module manufacturers can easily use the bifacial solar cells without changing their manufacturing equipments. Moreover, bifacial PV system has much potential in building application by utilizing glass-to-glass structure of PV module. However, the electrical generation of the bifacial PV module depends on the characteristics of the building surface which faces the module, as well as outdoor environment. Therefore, in order to apply the bifacial PV module to building envelope as BIPV system, its power generation characteristics are carefully evaluated. For this purpose this study focused on the electrical performance of the bifacial BIPV system through the comparative outdoor experiments. As a result, the power generation performance of the bifacial BIPV system was improved by up to 21% compared to that of the monofacial BIPV system.

In Cameroon, the electricity access is less than 5% in rural areas against 50% in urban areas.

Decentralised energy sources include: solar energy, wind energy, combined heat and power, and biogas.

Renewable energy generation through utility scale ground mounted solar photo-voltaic systems has gained steady popularity with increasing number of such facilities being constructed in various regions worldwide. Solar PV systems are very popular in the province of Ontario in Canada and strong growth in this sector is led by the popular initiatives of the Government of Ontario which offers extremely attractive rates for generation of renewable energy through Ontario Hydro\u2019s popular Feed-In Tariff (FIT) Program. Many other countries offer incentives on such generation of renewable energy while many governments aim at increasing the percentages of renewable energy in their systems tremendously. Most ambitious plan has recently been launched by the state of Hawaii to deploy 100% of renewable energy in their grid by 2045. Solar PV systems are a cheap source of renewable energy as the energy released by the sun is harnessed as electricity by the solar photo-voltaic panels which is fed to the main transmission systems after raising its voltage. The costs of solar photo-voltaic panels meanwhile have also kept downward trends while the manufacture of various types of solar panels has multiplied rapidly. These renewable energy generation facilities are fully sustainable being completely recyclable on completion of their design/ contract period. Typical utility scale ground mounted solar PV facilities usually comprise of solar PV panels mounted on series of racking tables supported on foundations mostly comprising of partially embedded steel pipes. The governing loads for the foundations of these lightly loaded solar PV structures are usually frost loads in areas facing extremely cold winters. In fine grained soils like silty/ clayey soils, large adfreeze stresses develop due to penetrating frost deep into the soil resulting into uplift of foundation piles. Typical winter conditions in Ontario are harsh with extreme frost conditions in most areas which poses unique issues for design and construction of such foundations. Being a relatively newer technology, codes and standards for design and testing of such lightly loaded solar PV structures are still in the formulation stages. Frost heaving and its effects often create adverse conditions for these structures thereby affecting the production and continuous supply of renewable energy. Due to larger depths of frost penetration in extreme winter conditions, understanding the action of frost and related development of adfreeze stresses on these lightly loaded pile foundations is extremely important. Calculating reasonable frost depths and thereby the design loads is an important part of pile design for such facilities while the contractors tend to save on pile lengths to save on costs and compromising the structural design. Many such Solar PV facilities have experienced frost uplift of foundation piles either during the construction phase or during its lifetime. Since frost heave is more of a serviceability related issue, unfactored adfreeze loads without any factor of safety is a usual tendency by the EPC contractors. This paper investigates the frost depths and adfreeze stress related issues with the foundation piles of solar PV facilities hence the governing design forces on these piles and suggests appropriate frost related design stresses for the foundation piles. The authors have been heavily involved in design/ design reviews, pile selection/ design and pile load testing in the majority of the solar PV farms in Canada and US along with rehabilitation of piles affected by frost [1,2,3].", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1162212589"}}

Employing the energy of the sun in refrigeration systems can substantially reduce electricity peaks during the summer months and at the same time reduce CO2 emissions. Furthermore, refrigeration via solar energy application is particularly attractive because of its non-dependence on conventional power and the near coincidence of peak cooling loads with the solar energy availability. In particular, the high levels of solar radiation in southern European regions make the use of solar assisted air-conditioning systems very suitable.

Abstract This study evaluated three-year operation of solar hot water heating system installed in multi-family housing complex with 1179 households in 14 units. At first, since the size of systems for multi-families are large, position of the building services room and collector installation becomes a significant matter. In order to resolve this, three building services rooms for three or four units of households were planned and the solar collectors were integrated directly on the roof facing South at 22\u00b0 degrees to the horizontal. The accumulated heat gain from three-year operation was 52% of the design baseline (4069\u00a0GJ/year). The reason for this could be a low altitude angle of collectors from the architectural design. Moreover, hot water usage and breakdowns of the system were evaluated using detailed analyses of operation data for three years by considering seasonal factors. These results are expected to give valuable feedback for the future design and wide use of the systems, as well as update the design baseline. Lastly, compared to a conventional boiler(\u03b4\u00a0=\u00a085%), the system produced a positive environmental effect equivalent to a reduction in oil use of 71,907\u00a0L/year, and reduced carbon emissions equivalent to 50.8 TC and 186.3 TCO2 the pay-back period for the system was expanded 5 years.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2024370593"}}

Most contributions on the issues of sustainability of rural electrification projects have focused on the technology and business models used to drive the projects. The issues of user education and environmental impact on the technology have received little attention. This has resulted in short lives of many rural electrification projects after commissioning. The usage pattern of solar home system (SHS) by most users that placed their solar panels close to obstructing objects, which results in shading of the panels, and location of households in the concession areas of South African SHS program is affecting the performances of SHS. The non-optimal use of SHS is as a result of lack of user education. Therefore this paper reports on the impact of location and shading of panels on the economics and technical performance of SHS. The study is achieved by investigating the performances of a 75 WP solar panel operated from two sites in South Africa (Upington in Northern Cape Province and Thlatlaganya in Limpopo Province), the performances of an optimized shaded SHS and a non-shaded one is also investigated. The results shows that both activities compromises the performance of the systems, the energy output of a solar panel located at Upington is increased by 10% and the state of charge of the battery (SOC) increased by 7%, compared to the panel situated at Thlatlaganya village. Also the life span of the battery is increased by about one year. The SOC of the partially shaded SHS is reduced by 22% and loss of power to the load increased by 20%.

BIPV system not only produces electricity at building, but also acts as a material for building envelope. Thus, it can increase the economical efficiency of PV system by saving the cost for building materials. Bifacial solar cell can convert solar energy to electrical energy from both sides of the cell. In addition, it is designed as 3 busbar layout which is the same with ordinary mono-facial solar cells. Therefore, many of the module manufacturers can easily use the bifacial solar cells without changing their manufacturing equipments. Moreover, bifacial PV system has much potential in building application by utilizing glass-to-glass structure of PV module. However, the electrical generation of the bifacial PV module depends on the characteristics of the building surface which faces the module, as well as outdoor environment. Therefore, in order to apply the bifacial PV module to building envelope as BIPV system, its power generation characteristics are carefully evaluated. For this purpose this study focused on the electrical performance of the bifacial BIPV system through the comparative outdoor experiments. As a result, the power generation performance of the bifacial BIPV system was improved by up to 21% compared to that of the monofacial BIPV system. Therefore, it is claimed that the bifacial BIPV system can replace the conventional BIPV system to improve the PV power generation in buildings.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2236665894"}}

Purpose: In design and planning Building Integrated Photovoltaic(BIPV) system can reduce cost by replacing building facade as construction material such as roofs, outer walls and windows as well as generating electricity. BIPV system should be applied at the early stage of architectural design. However, it is hard to decide whether using BIPV system or not for architects and builders who are not professional at BIPV system because performance of system is considerably influenced by types of module, installation position, installation methods and so on. It is also hard for experts because commercialized analytical program of photovoltaic systems is too complicated to use and domestic meteorological data is limited to partial areas. Therefore, we need evaluation program of BIPV system which can easily but accurately interpret generating performance and evaluate validity of BIPV system at the early stage of architectural design even for inexpert. Method: In this study, we collected meteorological data of domestic major region and analyzed generation characteristic of BIPV system by using PVsyst(commercialized software) in accordance with regions, types of solar module, place and methods of installation and so on. Based on this data, we developed performance evaluation program of BIPV system named BIPV-Pro, through multiple regression analysis and evaluated its validity. Result: When comparing predictive value of annual average PR and annual electricity production of BIPV-Pro an that of PVsyst, each of root mean square error was 0.01897 and 123.9.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2237253749"}}

The operation of the natural circulation type solar heating systems with facade integrated collector was analyzed by experiment. Two different types of flat plate solar collectors were used for these experiments. One was for the normal flat plate solar collector with the size of 1m*2m and the other was for the large size solar collector with 4\u33a1(1m*4m). The experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of the series or parallel connection method on the performance of the collectors. As a result, the solar thermal system which is installed on the wall or facade would be applicable for the natural circulation type if the system design reflects various parameters, including collector connecting method(series or parallel), to provide enough vertical height between collector and storage tank, and to reduce pressure loss due to collector and piping network, etc. The natural circulation type of solar thermal system as proposed in this study can increase the system reliability by removing or minimizing the use of the components such as pump, controller, sensors which may cause serious troubles of the system for a long-time operation.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2270485545"}}

In addition, we examine the relationship between efficiency, transmitted color, and band gap and conclude that high efficiencies can be achieved for a wide range of colors.

Solar energy technology can meet up to 100% of this demand depending on the size of the system, storage capacity, the heat load and the region\u2019s climate. Solar thermal collectors are particular type of heat extracting devices that convert solar radiation into thermal energy through a transport medium or flowing fluid. Although hybrid PV/T or thermal-alone systems offer some advantages to improve the solar heat utilisation, there are a few technical challenges found in these systems in practice that prevented wide-scale applications. These technical drawbacks include being expensive to make and install, inability of switching already-built photovoltaic (PV) systems into PV/T systems, architectural design etc. The aims of this project, therefore, were to investigate roof integrated solar thermal roof collectors that properly blend into surrounding thus avoiding \u2018add on\u2019 appearance and having a dual function (heat absorption and roofing). Another objective was to address the inherent technical pitfalls and practical limitations of conventional solar thermal collectors by bringing unique, inexpensive, maintenance free and easily adaptable solutions. Thus, in this innovative research, unique and simple building integrated solar thermal roof collectors have been developed for heating & cooling applications. The roof systems which mainly based on low cost and structurally unique polyethylene heat exchanger are relatively cost effective, competitive and developed by primarily exploiting components and techniques widely available on the market.

The key findings from the study confirm the potential of the examined technology, and elucidate the specific conclusions for the practice of such systems. The analysis showed that water temperature within the poly heat exchanger loop underneath PV units could reach up to 36\u00b0C and the system would achieve up to 20.25% overall thermal efficiency.

Abstract Solar Charging Station for Education and Research AbstractMany energy efficiency projects has been performed on our university campus in the past years.The achievement is remarkable. This paper will address the design of a pilot project, SolarCharging Station, through student\u2019s senior project for education and research. Students will learnthe theory of solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems and to design build an experimental solar chargingstation to charge the electric bikes. The integrated system will be used as the demonstration forthe two new courses, Renewable Energy and Solar PV Systems, at the University. The project issupported by the Energy and Sustainability Office of the university. If the pilot project issuccessful, many more solar charging stations will be installed on campus. The goals of thisproject are to educate the students of the University with the concept of sustainability, the theoryand hands-on experience of solar energy applications and to promote the sustainability oncampus by utilizing renewable energy.Through the project, students will be able to learn the theory of how the solar PV systems work,how to design the system (capacity and the specification) for PV modules, charge controller,inverter and the battery bank with hands-on experience. Besides charging the electric bikes, thesolar charging station can also be designed to charge electric cars. By monitoring the systemperformance, collecting data and conducting performance analysis, students will also learn howto improve the solar charging system. This paper will demonstrate the system design andperformance analysis as well as how the system will be used in the classes for students\u2019 learning.Project MotivationOur university is encouraging all faculty, staff and students to utilize the public transportationand bikes for their transportation between the Transit Station and the university campus to reducethe use of automobiles. However, the long uphill from the Transit Station to the campus will be achallenge to the bikers. Riding electric bike will be helpful to alleviate the burden and encouragethe utilization of the public transportation and the bikes. But if the electric bike is charged fromthe outlet on the wall, it is not sustainable because the power from the outlet is generated byburning the fossil fuel such as coal at the power company (not green energy).The idea of the project is to build a \"Solar Charging Station\" that will provide free electricity thatis generated by the solar Photovoltaic (PV) system for charging the electric bikes on campusinstead of charging from the wall outlet. If the electric bike is charged with the electricitygenerated from solar energy, then it will fit into the theme of sustainability because therenewable energy (green energy) is used.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2601909053"}}

Recently, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) modules have attracted great attention since they can not only be a part of building materials but also generate electric power. Among many types of BIPV modules, translucent hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar module has expand the range of applications to include windows, sunroofs and skylights, where it can be useful for both purpose of generating electricity and transparency for sunlight at the day time. There are two main types of translucent a-Si PV modules. The first one builds with a transparent conductive oxide thin film, instead of the metal film, as the back electrode. However, this type of module only allows light with wavelengths longer than 500 nm to pass through, leading to a reddish light and therefore visual discomfort. The other type translucent a-Si PV module uses the so-called ?P4 laser process? to remove silicon and back electrode layers so as to allow nature light transmission. In this study, 10% transmittance a-Si:H thin film solar modules are fabricated by laser processes. Effects of P4 laser line width and scribing directions, vertical, spot-like and horizontal in relation to the modules, are investigated. Firstly for the P4 laser line width optimization from 30-60 \u00b5m, the experimental result shows that with a constant transmittance, a module having a large line width could improve fill factor and conversion efficiency due to reduction of scribed line number needed, thus decreasing the damage of silicon layers. The 60 \u00b5m P4 laser line width leads to a minimum of performance degradation of about 11%. Further increasing the line width may need to introduce additional optical lens system to change laser beam distribution. Secondly, I-V curves and parameters of the modules fabricated using three different scribing directions show that the vertically scribed module has a high series resistance of 19.3 ? due to the long carrier transport length and small cross-sectional area. The spot-like module has the highest leakage current and diode ideality factor, indicating a reduced silicon film quality. This is likely due to spot-like scribing creating the largest amount of laser line edges, which usually contains high defects caused by laser thermal affection. The horizontally scribed module has the best fill factor, and the intermediate open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current. Finally, the horizontal scribing can lead to the lowest conversion efficiency degradation of about 12.7%.

During the last twenty years, the comfort and cooling requirements of office buildings and occupants have evolved significantly in Reunion Island, particularly during the summer period. This intensive use of air conditioning has resulted in a significant increase in electricity consumption such as traditional cooling technologies (mechanical vapor compression systems). In this context, solar cooling systems are one of the more interesting alternatives to conventional air conditioning systems. Thus in 2008, the PIMENT laboratory in Reunion Island proposed to set up an experimental platform called RAFSOL, on the University Institute of Technology of Saint-Pierre, to study the absorption solar cooling technology for a University building. Experimental and numerical investigations of RAFSOL allowed to identify several research topics to improve global performances of the installation. One of them concerns the incorporation of a new thermal storage into the solar cooling system. Indeed, the addition of thermal storage (hot and/or cold) give the following advantages: (i) sufficient cooling power to cover the entire building\u2019s needs, (ii) intelligent use the weekend energy potential, (iii) prevents overheating of the solar loop because of lower cooling needs. This thermal storage would also improve the system performance since it brings the temperatures of the hot and cold sources closer to their nominal values and thus optimizes the running time of the absorption chiller. In this work we decided to study only the incorporation of a hot thermal storage composed of a phase change  material, and to investigate the influence of this storage on the solar cooling system performances. Three different phase change temperatures are investigated according to the state of art of this echnology: 79, 84 and 90\u00b0C. Simulation results are then analyzed and discussed to identify the optimal configuration of the thermal storage. In this first approach, the results show that the most interesting melting temperature, to improve most of performance indicators is 79\u00b0C.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2947705166"}}

Based on curve fits of detailed thermal simulations of buildings, the algorithm provides fast estimation of monthly solar savings fraction for direct gain, indirect gain (water wall and concrete wall) and sunspace systems of a range of designs. Parameters are not available for passive solar heat pipe systems, which are of the isolated gain type. While modern computers have increased the speed with which detailed simulations can be performed, the quick estimates generated by the SLR method are still useful for early building design comparisons and for educational purposes. With this in mind, the objective of this project was to develop SLR predictions for heat pipe systems, which use heat pipes for one-way transport of heat into the building. A previous thermal network was used to simulate the heat pipe system with Typical Meteorological Year (TMY3) weather data for 13 locations across the US, representing ranges of winter temperature and available sunshine. A range of (nonsolar) load-to-collector ratio LCR = 1\u201315 W/m2K was tested for each location. The thermal network, along with TMY3 data, provided monthly-average-daily absorbed solar radiation and building load to calculate SLR. Losses from the solar aperture in a heat pipe system are very low compared to conventional passive solar systems, thus the load-to-collector ratio of the solar aperture was neglected in these preliminary calculations. Likewise, nighttime insulation is unnecessary for a heat pipe system, and was not considered. An optimization routine was used to determine an exponential fit (the heart of the SLR method) to simulated monthly solar savings fraction (SSF) across all locations and LCR values. Accuracy of SSF predicted by SLR compared to the thermal network results was evaluated. The largest errors (up to 50%) occurred for months with small heating loads (&lt; 80 K days), which inflated SSF. Limiting the optimization to the heating season (October to March), reduced the error in SSF to an average of 4.24% and a standard deviation of 5.87%. These results expand the applications of the SLR method to heat pipe systems, and allow building designers to use this method to estimate the thermal benefits of heat pipe systems along with conventional direct gain, indirect gain and sunspace systems.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2329665549"}}

This paper proposes a new method to accurately measure the visual impact which BIPV installations have on a historical building by using the saliency map method.

A PV system located in Southern Italy will be the subject of this assessment. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The paper presents the case of a 1 MW ground-mounted PV system. The data regarding solar radiation on the surface of the modules and the relative solar diagrams were simulated and reported using PVSYST\u00ae 5.21 software. To evaluate the profitability and solvency of the project, a number of factors were taken into consideration: profitability indicators of net present value and internal rate of return, the debt service coverage indicators of debt service cover ratio and loan life cover ratio and their mean annual values (annual debt service cover ratio and annual loan life cover ratio, respectively). A sensitivity analysis with respect to the most critical element (weighted average cost of capital) gave strength to the results. Findings \u2013 The achievement of grid parity for 200 kW PV systems is happening globally in areas with higher irradiation, but it clearly refers to residential utilities and is not applicable to large systems. The case study considers a power plant (= 1 MW) to assess the total cost that it would need to have to be economically advantageous.

Practical implications \u2013 The paper is useful for understanding the order of cost, which must catch up to PV technology to make investments in power plants profitable in the absence of government incentives. It is also helpful for those who make government policies so that these may propose possible incentives commensurate with the actual difference between the value of the technology and the value of the investment. The study is also useful for a possible comparison with a system sharing the same characteristics (size, energy production) for off-grid use and customers.

In this paper, we have designed and constructed a low cost solar-thermoelectric (TE) air-conditioning system for people in remote areas where electricity is still in short supply. Such system can be potentially used to condition tents and living areas. The proposed solar-powered TE air-conditioning system is based on the principles of Peltier effect to create a finite temperature difference across the condenser and the evaporator of the TE air-conditioning system. The cold side (or the evaporator) of the TE module is used for air-conditioning application; provides cooling to the living space. The thermal energy from the hot side of the module is dumped to the surrounding environment. Using the existing heat transfer and thermodynamics knowledge, an analytical model is developed to predict the performance of the solar-TE air-conditioning system in terms of the hot and cold reservoir temperatures, heat removal rates from the conditioned space, power input, and coefficient of performance (COP). A second analytical model is proposed to predict the cooling down period of the conditioned space as a function of heat removed by air-conditioning system, heat gained through the wall of the conditioned space, and heat generated inside the conditioned space. A detailed system is constructed to predict the performance of solar-TE air-conditioning system experimentally. A conditioned space was constructed to carry out the experimental work. Multiple air-conditioning systems were installed in the conditioned space. The cooling performance of the designed solar-TE air-conditioning system was experimentally tested and verified with the analytical calculation.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2004667600"}}

The Renewable Energy Framework Directive sets a target of 20% for renewables by 2020. Buildings account for 40% of the total primary energy requirements in the EU and are responsible for 30% of the generated greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, developing effective solar energy technologies which can be integrated into buildings and provide heat, electricity and/or reduce energy needs, is vital to achieving the set targets. While a range of technologies are available at the moment for building integration most of them are simply super-imposed on the building structure rather than becoming an essential part of it. This does not allow for the full advantages of building integration to materialise as it does not reduce costs by replacing conventional building materials and components. A Concentrating PV/Thermal Glazing (CoPVTG) facade technology that combines glazing based solar concentrating elements, coupled with PV/Thermal absorbers has been developed and experimentally evaluated at the Centre for Sustainable Technologies of the University of Ulster. As a modular multifunctional building component based on conventional double glazing, the CoPVTG is designed to be compatible with traditional facade structures and fenestration framing arrangements, facilitating direct integration into new and retrofit building applications. It can provide solar generated electricity and air heating through the PV/T absorbers while insulating the building thermally. The glazing based concentrating elements are designed to allow the sunlight to enter the building and provide natural daylight when required while redirecting it onto the PV/T absorbers to generate electricity/heat when solar gains need to be minimised to reduce cooling demands.A CoPVTG prototype unit has been fabricated using opti-white glass sheets. The concentrating elements have been cut onto the surface of one of the glass sheets and the PV/T absorbers have been attached using opti-clear silicon. The experimental performance of the prototype has been investigated under a solar simulator. Generation of electricity and heated air has been determined for two directions of the incident solar radiation.

Globally, the hydropower (HP) sector has significant potential to increase its capacity by 2050. This study quantifies the energy and resource demands of small-scale HP projects and presents methods to reduce associated environmental impacts based on potential growth in the sector. The environmental burdens of three (50-650 kW) run-of-river HP projects were calculated using life cycle assessment (LCA). The global warming potential (GWP) for the projects to generate electricity ranged from 5.5-8.9 g CO2 eq/kWh, compared with 403 g CO2 eq/kWh for UK marginal grid electricity. A sensitivity analysis accounted for alternative manufacturing processes, transportation, ecodesign considerations, and extended project lifespan. These findings were extrapolated for technically viable HP sites in Europe, with the potential to generate 7.35 TWh and offset over 2.96 Mt of CO2 from grid electricity per annum. Incorporation of ecodesign could provide resource savings for these HP projects: avoiding 800 000 tonnes of concrete, 10 000 tonnes of steel, and 65 million vehicle miles. Small additional material and energy contributions can double a HP system lifespan, providing 39-47% reductions for all environmental impact categories.

Transpired Solar Collectors (TSCs) are an increasingly popular technology, with over 12,500 m2 of TSCs integrated with buildings across Wales and England by the end of 2013. But in order for TSCs to achieve the desired low economic and embodied energy payback periods, their design, manufacture, installation and commissioning needs to be seamlessly integrated with that of the building as a whole. To facilitate the selection and integration of a TSC in the earliest stages of building design, a new feasibility tool for Transpired Solar Collectors has been developed. The new tool enables a full feasibility assessment to be carried out in less than five minutes, and its user-friendly methodology and interface allows it to be used by building designers who have little or no experience in designing solar thermal collectors. Comparative research presented in this paper demonstrates that the tool's feasibility engine provides similar energy performance results to the RETScreen\u00ae V3.1 Solar Air Heating Project Model. In addition, the new tool automatically calculates the building's heating demand and is able to consider the impact of internal gains (solar and occupancy), collector tilt, and low emissivity coatings. The new tool is not intended to replace the role of more sophisticated, dynamic modelling and simulation tools which the expert user and building energy assessor would be expected to use for the detailed design of a TSC.

Summary Sustainable building rooftop technologies, such as white roofs, green roofs, and photovoltaic(s) (PV) panels, are becoming increasingly implemented as a result of their associated environmental benefits. Studies of these rooftop technologies are often located in hot climates and do not assess their full environmental consequences. Further, current studies tend to focus on one technology and often do not evaluate the full range of technology options using a systematic framework with common assumptions and boundaries. This article evaluates the environmental performance on a life cycle basis of white roofs, green roofs, and roof\u2010mounted PV in the cold Canadian climate. Solar PV demonstrates the highest environmental performance in all impact categories considered (see complete list in Results section) and is the preferred option from an environmental perspective. Green roofs result in beneficial environmental impacts, although much less significant than those obtained with PV, and are the only rooftop technology that reduces both heating and cooling energy use. The environmental performance of white roofs in cold climates is strongly affected by the heating penalty (i.e., the increase in heating energy use resulting from the high solar reflectance). Although white roofs have been proven an outstanding option in warmer climates, in cold climates, net negative environmental impacts lead to white roof technology not being recommended for general applications in cold climates. A sensitivity analysis shows that the conclusions in this study provide robust insights across Canada and cold climates in general.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2136967139"}}

On the other hand, the possibility that birds, though slightly, may suffer when wind is used as a source of energy renders solar energy more environment-friendly and important. Therefore, the use of solar panels is increasing rapidly. Solar panels, which, with their increased power capacity, are used in homes, country cottages, street lighting, meeting the electricity needs of public buildings, garden lighting and irrigation systems, are especially used in meeting the energy needs in specific remote locations. In this study, a new approach was suggested in the selection of material to be used in solar panel systems in country cottages. In the suggested approach, the panels are connected in two different groups taking into consideration the hours of usage of the loads that will consume the electricity. One of these groups is used to meet instant needs whereas the other is used to charge the battery. In this way, fewer solar panels are needed compared with the conventional calculation method. Moreover, the number of batteries needed by the system is also reduced. As a result, the number of solar panels and battery-related costs can be reduced.

Zero energy building is a self sufficient building that minimizes energy consumption through passive elements such as insulation, high performance window system and installing of high efficiency HVAC system and uses renewable energy sources. The Korea Government has been strengthening the building energy efficiency standard and code for zero energy building. The building energy performance is determined by the performance of building envelope. Therefore it is important to optimize facade design such as insulation, window properties and shading, that affect the heating and cooling loads. In particular, shading devices are necessary to reduce the cooling load in summer season. Meanwhile, BIPV shading system functions as a renewable energy technology applied in solar control facade system to reduce cooling load and produce electricity simultaneously. Therefore, when installing the BIPV shading system, the length of shadings and angle that affect the electricity production must be considered. This study focused on the facade design applied with BIPV shading system for maximizing energy saving of the selected standard building. The impact of changing insulation on roof and walls, window properties and length of BIPV shading device on energy performance of the building were investigated. In conclusion, energy consumption and electricity production were analyzed based on building energy simulations using energyplus 8.1 building simulation program and jEPlus+EA optimization tool.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2134649089"}}

The application of wafer based Photovoltaics (PVs) have been long hindered by their high production, installation and maintenance costs, as well as their poor product design for building integration. The upcoming organic photovoltaic (OPV) with high processibility of active layer materials through Roll to Roll (R2R) printing technology exhibits as a promising alternative due to its low capital costs and better visual pleasing appearance. This potential has been enhanced by its recent efficiency and lifetime research progresses. Meanwhile, fluoropolymeric membrane materials like Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) share higher popularity as a glass substitute in contemporary architecture context attributing to their extraordinary lightness, transparency and high flexibility. Coincidentally, most of the membrane material application occasions, including roofing and facade of large public buildings such as stadiums, exhibition hall, as well as building atrium and aisle roofs, are also the potential building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) integration scenarios. PV-Flexible proposes a novel BIPV product solution by taking advantages of both PV technology\u2019s renewable solar energy harvesting capability and easier architectural utilization of membrane substrates. This PhD research explores the possibility, difficulties and effectiveness of ETFE substrate printed OPV layers & cells.  Far too little researches have investigated the design and development of PV-Flexibles, while its potential market segments has also not yet been well addressed. Current OPV layers are typically deposited on plastic substrates like Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), resulting in inferior performance as architectural components. Even few works have been devoted to explore the performance of PV-Flexible in real application. In order to achieve better printing of OPV onto ETFE, the wettability of ETFE surface has been studied and pre-treatments to enhance it have been verified in this research. ETFE demands a high surface hydrophobicity, which leads to a bad printing quality of OPV electrode layers. Deposition of an extra Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) layer above the ETFE surface has been proven to be able to decrease its hydrophobicity. The oxygen plasma treatment has reached a much higher delamination load and has been evidenced to be more effective for a higher adhesiveness of PMMA layer on ETFE surface than the corona treatment. The responses of OPV layer composite under external loads have been investigated through experimental works with both commercial OPV modules and ETFE printed OPV layers, to understand better the weakness, the failure mechanism of OPV in strain and how this will influence its performance. The commercial organic module loses its effectiveness after meeting the critical strain of 1.8%, corresponding to a critical stress of 20MPa. The ETFE printed Ag electrode conductance is less sensitive than PET printed one with large strains. This research also implemented the experimental printing of prototype OPV cells onto ETFE substrate, and its performance characterization.  The research outcomes revealed by this survey can provide valuable knowledge for future realization of easy printed, mechanically robust OPV on architectural membranes.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3035899304"}}

The parameters used for economic analysis of modeling work are Net Present value (NPV), payback period, Internal Rate of Return (IRR) etc. Different parameters were compared for different selected locations. Finally, it is found in the analysis that solar irradiation level has great influence on the PV array size, its efficiency, capital cost, IRR, payback period and levelised cost of energy, etc. Also electricity generated by the solar PV system reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and makes the environment more eco friendly.

Photovoltaic (PV) system comprising PV modules and related control system is the sole means through which the solar energy is converted directly into electricity. The PV module is generally rated according to its maximum DC power output (Wp) which is obtained under Standard Test Condition. However, this condition is seldom encountered, especially in the high temperature and variable irradiance climate like Malaysia. On the other hand, in the actual operating conditions, the energy generated from PV module is sturdily influenced by surrounding climate; hence, a performance evaluation model for PV system is necessary. This research proposes a mathematical algorithm to calculate the hourly, monthly and annually expected PV system energy output, considering the actual PV module temperature (Tm) increase effect. The new algorithm was developed due to the limitation in the existing methodologies particularly the one used in Malaysia by Malaysian Green Technology Corporation (MGTC). The developed Tm prediction model is based on the pre-processed hourly data measured for 9 months at the 92 kWp Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) GreenTech Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor which includes Tm, ambient temperature (Ta), solar irradiance (G), wind speed (Ws) and Relative Humidity (RH). The developed algorithm was compared to the model used by MGTC and validated with actual measurements. In addition, 5 years of hourly data for Ta, G, and Ws measured at 6 different locations in Malaysia obtained from Malaysia Meteorological Department were used for development of a solar radiation and energy output estimation models. The proposed energy model gives good result since it is closer to measured data compared to the PVWatts simulation tool. Results on the techno-economic analysis are also presented. The proposed energy output estimation model is expected to be useful for the PV system installer in the pre-installation phase in terms of feasibility and performance analysis of the PV system.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2942841939"}}

The aim of the project is the development and the implementation of photovoltaic BIPV ceramic modules to be used in buildings for the construction of active envelopes. In particular, one of the research lines of the project involves the construction of BIPV ceramic modules by depositing a thin film of amorphous silicon on a ceramic support. Research and development activities previously carried out by the Ceramic Centre of Bologna in collaboration with other companies have led to the production of prototype of a ceramic photovoltaic module. The project aims to the optimization and the industrialization of the module. Other BIPV modules (for example made on glass sheets) have been used in the construction industry for over 20 years as an integral part of the building, in both horizontal (roofs and skylights) and vertical components (facades). The use of these modules allows the realization of active technical elements, reducing the use of raw materials. The environmental impact assessment of the BIPV ceramic module was conducted through the life-cycle approach, in accordance with the international standards of the ISO 14040 series, in order to define the eco-profile, identifying the processes with the greatest impacts and suggesting improvements.

A residential solar-heating-and-cooling (SHC) system is a possible alternative for the reduction of fossil fuel consumption to cover residential energy loads. These systems can cover all thermal loads, i.e. space heating, space cooling and domestic hot water preparation. Space cooling is fulfilled through a heat-activated (hot water), single-effect LiBr-water absorption chiller. Proper operation of such a system requires coupling of the solar collector array to a hot water storage tank with auxiliary heating. Auxiliary heating, in this case in the form of a diesel-fired boiler, is necessary to supplement heating in the storage tank when demand exceeds solar heating availability. In this study emphasis is given on the effect of the collector tilt angle (slope) on the performance of a SHC system. A constant slope throughout the year simplifies system configuration and maintenance, but on the other hand a variable slope improves performance, in terms of energy efficiency, and thereby lowers the operating cost of auxiliary heating. The results of the study show that it is economically beneficial to vary the slope throughout the year (on a monthly basis), since $233/year can be saved when a variable slope is used.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2316991573"}}

The concept of zero energy building (ZEB) is an attractive approach in order to reduce the energy requirement of buildings leading to more sustainable cities. Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is one suitable technology for providing electricity to the buildings with a minimum impact. Traditionally, photovoltaics (PV) have been installed looking for maximum yearly energy production.

The results show interesting features, considering yearly and hourly generation profiles. Although the annual energy production for the fa\u00e7ades and the roof is between 50% and 76% of an optimum angle installation, the fa\u00e7ades have a more stable production along the year: monthly production can vary by a factor 2 vs a variation of factor 4 for irradiance.

The twenty first century is rapidly becoming the perfect energy storm, modern society is faced with volatile energy prices and growing environmental concerns as well as energy supply and security issues. One of the greatest challenges facing mankind in the twenty first century is energy. Fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas have been the main energy resources for everything vital for human society. The burning of fossil fuels has caused and is causing damage to the environment of earth. By 2050 the demand for energy could double or even triple as the global population grows and developing countries expand their economies. This has already raised concerns over potential supply difficulties, depletion of energy resources and expediting environmental impacts like ozone layer depletion, global warming and climate change etc. The most abundant energy resource available to human society is solar energy. The utilization of solar energy is as old as human history. Among various types of renewable energy resources, solar energy is the least utilized. Air conditioning is essential for maintaining thermal comfort in indoor environments, particularly for hot and humid climates. Today, air conditioning comprising cooling and dehumidification has become a necessity in commercial and residential buildings and industrial processes. During the summer, the demand for electricity greatly increases because of the extensive use of air-conditioning systems. This is a source of major problems in the country's electricity supply and contributes to an increase of CO2 emissions causing the environmental pollution and global warming. On the other hand, vapour compression air conditioning systems have impacts on stratospheric ozone depletion because of the chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and the hydro fluorocarbon (HCFC) refrigerants. The use of solar energy to drive cooling cycles is attractive since the cooling load is roughly in phase with solar energy availability. To cool with solar thermal energy, one solution is to use an absorption chillier using water and lithium bromide solution. Solar air conditioning systems help to minimize fossil fuel energy use. Among the evolving energy efficient air conditioning technologies are liquid desiccant air conditioning (LDAC) systems, which have showed promising performance during the past decades and are believed to be a strong competitor with the widely used conventional air conditioning systems (CAC). Desiccant evaporation cooling technology is environmental friendly and can be used to condition the indoor environment of buildings. Unlike conventional air conditioning systems, the desiccant air conditioning systems can be driven by low grade heat sources such as solar energy and industrial waste heat. In this study, a focus is made on reduction in Air Conditioning capacity, fuel savings and emission reductions attainable through the use of solar energy.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1037194448"}}

Today, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) is being considered by building designers as an innovative technique for clean energy production and reduction of green house gases. Integration of PV cells in the building envelope can help in overcoming many economical and social barriers that are preventing a wider dissemination of the technology in the Mediterranean area. The BIPV components are multifunctional elements that can be used not only as energy converters, but also as shading devices, cladding, fa\u00e7ade or roofing elements, etc. The Mediterranean countries are located in a relatively sunny area with a global horizontal radiation of 7.5\u20138 kWh/m2 in summer. However, the temperature in these countries can reach high levels for the same period. This can affect the performance of the BIPV cells. In this paper, BIPV systems are analyzed through a literature review where the BIPV systems that are most suitable for Mediterranean climate are investigated according to architectural constraints. The case of commercial buildings is considered where different integration scenarios are compared and analyzed.

To regulate the mass flow rate of the refrigerant vapor passing through a water storage tank for increasing the refrigerant's sub-cooling process at partial loads, we propose a new discharge bypass line together with an inline solenoid valve, installed after the compressor. In addition, to control the air flow rate, a variable speed drive is coupled with the condenser fan. For the control purpose, a lumped parameter model is first developed to describe the system dynamics in an explicit input\u2013output relationship; then, a linear optimal control scheme is applied for the system's multivariable control. The system has been fully-instrumented to examine its performance under different operation conditions. The system model is then validated by extensive experimental tests. Based on the obtained dynamic model, an optimal controller is designed to minimize a quadratic cost function. Numerical algorithms, implemented in a simulation tool, are then employed to predict the energy performance of the system under transient loads. The experimental results obtained from implementation with PLC demonstrate that the newly-developed system can deliver higher system efficiency owing to amelioration of the refrigeration effect in the direct expansion evaporator and adjustment of its air flow rate. The development is thus promising for improvement of energy efficiency, enhancement of the system performance while fulfilling the cooling demand.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2082198931"}}

However, though more than ten years have passed after the introduction of BIPV, the implementation is still considered very weak as it is still not a common practice in the construction industry. One of the reasons is because many are still sceptical about BIPV especially among house buyers and are more concern to the prices of the houses. The other factor is developers are dormant in using BIPV and have limited support in BIPV information that can convince house buyers make their decision to invest into BIPV. This research investigates the application issues faced by the developers, their outlook on BIPV and considerations for selection on BIPV. A three stage Delphi interview with eight developer companies as part of a purposive sample is applied, where stage one focuses on the application issues that is faced by developing and stage two the depth of the issues with workable solutions is proposed and validated among the developing consensus. Stage three helps mapping out crucial criteria of selection process that the developers will employ and other consideration towards BIPV. The preliminary results show that more establish developers have employed green technology, but none has considered BIPV yet with cost as a major factor in mind.

These range from powering mobile phones, electric cars, buildings and street lights covering small and large scale areas (one or a forest of PVTrees). This study brought together a research team of physicists and designers and to conduct focus groups with design based methods and prototyping (clustering of ideas, sketching and modelling) along with a computational 3D PVTree design tool. The focus groups consisted of capturing a) people's perception on PVTrees, idea generations and development of the 3D model and b) further discussion and evaluation of insights. A public exhibition followed to capture public perception on design concepts using 3D models, and a voting exercise.

Electric power is a key driver of economic growth and prosperity. But access to electricity still remains a distant dream for majority of the population living in the remote and arid areas of developing countries mostly sub-Saharan Africa. With the growing demand for safe and reliable energy, solar as a source of energy remains the least utilized energy source in the Kenyan economy and yet one of the safest forms of energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have shown their potential in rural electrification projects around the world. A solar based mini-grid is a solar PV (photovoltaic) plant with a localized distribution network to a unit village, or a cluster of villages, providing alternating current (AC). Basically it consists of solar PV modules of a certain capacity, solar inverters for converting the D.C power to AC power, housing for the battery bank and plant control systems. In areas where there is no grid connection or where diesel generation is the main power source, PV plants are able to generate electricity efficiently and relatively cheap. This paper was aimed at developing a standard procedure for the design and analysis of a mini-grid connected solar PV systems using PV modules connected in an array field. The standard procedure developed was validated in the design of a 20 kVA mini-grid-connected solar PV system for Nanyuki town in Laikipia County, Kenya. The analysis and evaluation of the load capacity requirements for the solar mini-grid were done. Data collected from SWERA were compared with the local load requirements. Optimization of the load versus production capacity of the solar system was carried out. The results showed that a mini-grid system of 20 kVA might be developed at a capital cost of US$ 56,000 to cater for 8400 households including a school and dispensary. Analyses of the simulation results show that the project when implemented will supply about 61 KW\u00b7h electricity per day or 22.2 MWh annually, which is about 15% of Nanyuki\u2019s annual electricity consumption. The project also stands the chance of saving about 200 tonnes of CO2 which will have been emitted by a crude oil fired thermal power plant generating the same amount of electricity. At the prevailing tariff conditions in the country, this project can be considered as financially viable with feed-in tariff scheme or other incentives such as grants/capital subsidies when applied.

The challenge is to make Building Integrated Photovoltaics BIPV and own-consumption of PV energy attractive and comfortable to the people. Providing Smart BIPV systems that consist of the PV system, an energy manager and a house management system adaptable to the individual lifestyle of the people could be a helpful motivation to support the PV micro grid generation. In the Smart BIPV system the energy manager is monitoring all energy flows within the building, the consumed energy and the PV production. This detailed visualization makes the people sensible to their energy demands and gives them a real chance to improve their consumption habits. To achieve high own-consumption automatically switching of different appliances is necessary. The PV manager is able to switch appliances on and off according to the individual settings. Flexible appliances with high energy demand (washing machine, dishwasher, and dryer) can be adapted to the own-produced energy. They are connected to different defined power sockets and the central unit will start them when enough PV energy is available. The inhabitants can change the settings individually to their needs, thus they can train their skills and gain experiences in coordinating different machines. Other appliances must work independently from the PV energy (air conditioner, fan, blinds) and should be switched according to the inhabitant\u2019s schedule. For example the air-conditioner should not run the whole day but before the inhabitants\u2019 return, the central-unit can switch it on by settings or remotely to make a comfortable climate. This will not increase the own-consumption but reduces the demand of conventionally produced energy extensively and makes a good conscience.

That means a visible usage of renewable energy day by day. The Smart BIPV systems can be introduced in new buildings and also in occupied villas. The PV manager is part of this system and the central unit is also connected to the electric meters, power sockets, switch sockets and several components like sensors for measuring temperature, humidity and motion in-house and outside.

Building Integrated Photovoltaic systems (BIPV) are gaining popularity as urban energy systems move towards decentralization. The calculation of the incoming solar radiation for building rooftops at a high temporal resolution is a key input to perform an energy balance of buildings within the larger context of an urban energy planning exercise and to control the supply and demand of energy. Solar radiation on building rooftop surfaces is highly stochastic due to highly variable cloud cover. Hence, for improving the accuracy in calculating the energy potential of BIPV, it is important to incorporate varying cloud cover in the simulation approach. This study presents a GIS based methodology for calculating hourly solar radiation on building rooftop surfaces taking into account the variability in cloud cover. The location of the study is the Fluntern weather station in Zurich, Switzerland. The r.sun module of the open source GIS software suit GRASS is used to calculate the clear sky irradiation (CSR). To account for the cloud cover, a reduction factor called the clear sky index (KC) which is dependent on the cloud cover is applied to the calculated CSR to obtain the real sky radiation. KC is calibrated for different values of cloud cover and time of day using measured meteorological data spanning a time period from 1981 to 2014 from the weather station. The hourly cloud cover is predicted through a discrete state Markov process. KC, the measured cloud cover, the simulated clear sky radiation are then used to obtain the real sky radiation and is validated against the measured values of solar radiation. Results show that the taking into account the cloud cover for calculating radiation reduces the root mean square error and the mean bias deviation by 37% and 86% respectively.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2244825138"}}

Water heating contributes a significant part of energy consumption in typical household. One of the most employed technologies today that helps in reducing the energy consumption of water heating would be conventional solar water heating system. However, this system is expensive and less affordable by most family. The main objective of this project is to design and implement an alternative type of solar water heating system that utilize only passive solar energy which is known as slab solar water heating system. Slab solar water heating system is a system that heat up cold water using the solar radiance from the sun. The unique part of this system is that it does not require any form of electricity in order to operate. Solar radiance is converted into heat energy through convection method and cold water will be heated up by using conduction method [1]. The design of this system is governed by the criteria of low implementation cost and energy saving. Selection of material in the construction of a slab solar water heating system is important as it will directly affect the efficiency and performance of the system. A prototype has been built to realize the idea and it had been proven that this system was able to provide sufficient hot water supply for typical household usage at any given time.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1478925414"}}

During the design process several design challenges had to be overcome in order for the SolarTurtle to survive South Africa\u2019s harsh realities. Firstly, solar panels are often the target of theft and vandalism, therefore security measures must be in place. Secondly, maintenance in rural settings is difficult at best. The design must be robust enough to last as long as the solar PV panels. Thirdly if something should go wrong the broken components must be easy to replace, with minimal skills required. Hence a simple design is required without compromising the efficiency of the design. Lastly, the economic factor is of vital consideration. If the SolarTurtle is not economically viable the project will be unsuccessful.

In Iraq most of the small buildings deployed a conventional air conditioning technology which typically uses electrically driven compressor systems which exhibits several clear disadvantages such as high energy consumption, high electricity peak loads demand. Because of the high energy cost, the decrease of fossil fuel resources, the utilization of low level renewable energy sources such as solar energy in refrigeration systems has become a way to address these problems. So a thermal performance of air conditioning system combined with a solar collector is investigated experimentally. The hybrid air conditioner consists of a semi hermetic compressor, water cooled shell and tube condenser, thermal expansion valve and coil and tank evaporator. Different experimental tests were conducted by varying the controlling parameters to investigate their effects on the thermal performance of the solar assisted air-conditioning .The parameters are cooling water flow rate, evaporator water temperature, ambient temperature, refrigerant mass flow rate, storage tank water temperature, and solar radiation intensity under meteorological condition of Baghdad in summer 2015.

By 2016, new residential buildings in the UK will have to be \u2018net zero carbon\u2019 to comply with proposed changes to Part L of the Government\u2019s Building Regulations. Approved document Part L of the Building Regulations requires energy use and generation, and the resulting carbon emissions, to be quantified using the Government\u2019s standard assessment procedure (SAP) model. To achieve a zero carbon dwelling, on-site renewable technologies must usually be incorporated into the design. Since the introduction of the feed-in tariff (FIT), in April 2010, photovoltaic (PV) systems have been seen as one of the most cost effective methods of achieving the higher levels of the code for sustainable homes (CfSH), the route to meet zero carbon emissions in domestic buildings. The quantification of energy generation for CfSH certification, comes directly from the SAP model, where the methodology used to justify the use of PV systems is crude in its prediction of shading and utilises simplified rules-of-thumb to predict how shading will affect energy generation. This chapter compares the prediction methods currently available to designers (SAP) against real data collected on live building projects in South West London. Included in this study is the physical measurement of solar radiation where PV panels will be installed at a later date, together with the measured outputs from two recent domestic PV installations that are benefiting from the FIT initiative. For both of these, in terms of solar radiation and electricity production, comparisons are made between actual measurements and predicted results. The results of this study show that the methodology provided in the SAP 2005 and 2009 models for determining the available energy at inverter output (kWh/year) for solar PV systems is crude and inaccurate, particularly in locations where there is significant shading from external obstructions, and particularly where an evaluation of the overshading is required. The SAP methodology for quantifying the shading coefficient is crude and there are little guideline provided. A novel technique for quantifying overshading has been tested in this study and the results indicate that a more robust method is required. The methodology being proposed is in line with more comprehensive approaches that have been adopted by other organisations, in particular new guidelines and methodologies published and recommended by the microgeneration certification scheme (MCS). Proposals by the BRE for improvements to the SAP 2012 model, for the calculation of incident solar radiation, and the energy generated by a solar PV system, are generally positive but the determination of overshading in any particular location remains crude and difficult to quantify.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2237209921"}}

With the growing popularity of solar cells in Sweden, real estate companies have become interested in the possibility of installing solar panels when constructing new apartment buildings. Riksbyggen is one of these companies that sees solar energy as an interesting alternative when constructing energy-efficient buildings with low energy consumption.The purpose of this study is to investigate optimal system solutions and the profitability of a PV-system in a newly produced apartment building containing 28 apartments in Vasteras. This investigation is made possible by creating and simulating the PV-system in the simulation program PVSyst.The PV-system that will be installed on Brf. Sjokortet has an installed capacity of 54 kW. 40 kW will be placed on the roof with a tilt of 4\u00b0 while 14 kW will be placed on the facade with a tilt of 90\u00b0.According the simulation results, the PV-system will produce 43,6 MWh per year, which means the specific electricity production becomes 807 kWh/kWp. Own use of solar electricity is estimated to be 61 %, which means that 26,7 MWh will be utilized directly by the housing association, while 16,9 MWh must be submitted for sale. Out of the solar electricity that can be used directly 9,9 MWh will cover the property electricity meanwhile the remaining 16,8 MWh covers the residents household electricity. The residents of the housing cooperative will thus gain access to a large portion of the produced solar electricity without having to pay for it.The PV-system will without investment aid become unprofitable with an annuity of \u2013 16 304 SEK per year. When the investment aid covering 35 % of the investment cost is included, the PV-system becomes profitable with an annuity of 2 687 SEK per year.The own use of solar electricity is difficult to improve by only changing the tilt of the solar panels. However, the results shows that a greater amount of solar electricity can be utilized by the housing cooperative in the winter months by increasing the amount of solar panels on the facade while decreasing the amount of solar panels on the roof with the same amount. A higher amount of solar panels on the facade will though decrease the yearly solar electricity production, making it more difficult for the PV-system to show profitability.The determined distribution of solar modules on the roof and facade is optimally distributed if the goal for the housing association is to utilize as much solar electricity as possible directly.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1414580033"}}

Because of the soaring energy prices, many countries have shown an increased interest in the utilization of solar energy. The optimization of the solar energy collector design plays a critical role in the efficient collection of solar energy. Flat-plate collectors can be designed in applications that require energy delivery at moderate temperatures (up to 100 \u25e6 C above ambient temperature). These collectors use both beam and diffuse solar radiation, and do not need to track the sun. They are simple to manufacture and install with relatively low maintenance cost which make this kind of solar collectors more popular. The design of a flat-plate solar collector embraces many relationships among the collector parameters, field parameters and solar radiation data at any given location. The shading decreases the incident energy on collector plane of the field. The multi-objective optimum design of stationary flat-plate solar collectors is presented in this work. The clear day solar beam radiation and diffuse radiation at the location of the solar collector (Miami) are estimated. The maximization of the annual average incident solar energy, maximization of the lowest month incident solar energy and minimization of the cost are considered as objectives.. The game theory methodology is used for the solution of the three objective problems to find the best compromise solution.

Developing photovoltaic systems can be done gradually. In the first stage, by establishing an emergency solar power supply system, we can store power for a few hours or a few days. In addition, we can create an augury for the public by developing the advertisements and publishing the advantages of this system compared to municipal power through media and cyberspace.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1696459456"}}

Increasing demand for ways to make use of renewable energy, has led to a greater need for methods to estimate the optimal position of energy system that make use of solar power. Systems for solar analysis make it possible to estimate incoming solar radiation on surfaces based on the structure of landscapes, buildings and vegetation. To make use of the data derived from solar analysis, there is a user need for applications that summarize and present the data in a meaningful way. It is possible to create an interactive environment through an application for visualization of 3D-models. This interactive environment can be used to create custom functions that are geared towards creating uses for incoming solar radiation. An application for such visualization would function through the use of data on incoming solar radiation, a user interface and a technique for 3D-visualization. These components need to be integrated in working application architecture. Systems for solar analysis generate large amounts of data. This creates a need for solutions that allows the visualization application to function without performance related problems. Furthermore, a useful application has to be able to create a link between the data from solar analysis to existing structures such as buildings. SEBE (Solar Energy on Building Envelopes) is a solar analysis system developed in cooperation between Gothenburg University and the consulting firm Tyrens AB. Data produced by this system were used in the case study of this project. The goal of the project was to investigate what possiblites exists for creating an application for visualization based on the data produced by SEBE. Through user analysis a set of user needs and technical requirements was developed for the application. Through research into what similar applications exist and how they functions a set of possible architectures were identified. The architecture thought to be most fitting for the application was identified, and used to create a prototype of the application. As part of the project the prototype was evaluated. A plugin program, titled SEBEvisualizer was developed for QGIS with support for 3D-models created in OpenGL. This was the platform determined most fitting for development of an applictation for visualization. SEBEvisualizer makes use of vector layers, a database, the QGIS API and the Qt framewok to handle and visualize incoming solar radiation. Voxels, or volume pixels, make it possible to create 3D-models of buildings and other complex objects without the need for any kind of sorting algorithms. Voxel based methods have drawbacks on performance but are easy to implement correctly. The conclusions made from the project are that it is possible to create a useable application for visualization. There are problems with meeting the needs of all kinds of users in a single application. The development platform consisting of QGIS and OpenGL has benefits pertaining to the handling of geographic data and good performance. Drawbacks are that users have a harder time finding and using the application. With future progress in web based 3D-modeling, through supports such as WebGL, an application developed for the web might be more fitting to reach a broader user base.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1697157215"}}

In this thesis the solar part of a large grid-connected photovoltaic system design has been done. The main purpose was to size and optimize the system and to present figures helping to evaluate the prospective project rationality, which can potentially be constructed on a contaminated area in Falun. The methodology consisted in PV market study and component selection, site analysis and defining suitable area for solar installation; and system configuration optimization based on PVsyst simulations and Levelized Cost of Energy calculations.The procedure was mainly divided on two parts, preliminary and detailed sizing. In the first part the objective was complex, which included the investigation of the most profitable component combination and system optimization due to tilt and row distance. It was done by simulating systems with different components and orientations, which were sized for the same 100kW inverter in order to make a fair comparison. For each simulated result a simplified LCOE calculation procedure was applied. The main results of this part show that with the price of 0.43 \u20ac/Wp thin-film modules were the most cost effective solution for the case with a great advantage over crystalline type in terms of financial attractiveness.From the results of the preliminary study it was possible to select the optimal system configuration, which was used in the detailed sizing as a starting point. In this part the PVsyst simulations were run, which included full scale system design considering near shadings created by factory buildings. Additionally, more complex procedure of LCOE calculation has been used here considered insurances, maintenance, time value of money and possible cost reduction due to the system size.Two system options were proposed in final results; both cover the same area of 66000 m2. The first one represents an ordinary South faced design with 1.1 MW nominal power, which was optimized for the highest performance. According to PVsyst simulations, this system should produce 1108 MWh/year with the initial investment of 835,000 \u20ac and 0.056 \u20ac/kWh LCOE. The second option has an alternative East-West orientation, which allows to cover 80% of occupied ground and consequently have 6.6 MW PV nominal power. The system produces 5388 MWh/year costs about 4500,000 \u20ac and delivers electricity with the same price of 0.056 \u20ac/kWh. Even though the EW solution has 20% lower specific energy production, it benefits mainly from lower relative costs for inverters, mounting and annual maintenance expenses.After analyzing the performance results, among the two alternatives none of the systems showed a clear superiority so there was no optimal system proposed. Both, South and East-West solutions have own advantages and disadvantages in terms of energy production profile, configuration, installation and maintenance.

Energy use in buildings accounts for a significant proportion of the total energy use in many countries. While past and current buildings have solely been energy consumers, future buildings will, besides using less energy, also need to produce (part of ) the required energy on site with renewables. Solar energy is generally very suitable for producing this on-site renewable energy. Although solar technology is widely available, the installed effect is still very low. This is not only due to legislation and solar energy prices, but also because of decisions made throughout the design process for buildings. This research focuses on the decisions taken during the design process and by which player, and also the impact of such decisions, by using a mix of quantitative and qualitative research.  In the first research phase, semi-structured interviews were held with Scandinavian architects who had worked with solar energy during the building design process. The architects identified several crucial points for designing buildings with solar energy \u2013 the importance of collabora\u00action and teamwork, the lack of attractive solar products, and that clients are actually not prioritising solar energy. The interviews also showed that architects rarely used any sophisticated tools to quantify solar energy, and that zoning plans can hinder the possibilities for implementing solar energy in buildings.  The next research phase focused on the implementation of solar energy in urban planning. Action research, and analytical and parametric studies were used to examine how decisions in the urban planning process affect the possibilities for implementing solar energy, as well as how these deci-sions were supported by tools.  Solar maps have become a popular tool for assessing the potential of solar energy in existing buildings, but an analysis of 19 solar maps showed that the underlying assumptions and methodology of such maps varied greatly. The amount of information provided to the user also varied greatly. While solar maps are used to analyse existing buildings, a proper solar assessment of new buildings requires the use of advanced simulation tools. In this research, such tools are used in three cases \u2013 an analysis of flat roofs, the development of a new facade assessment tool, and an analysis of typical Swedish building blocks.  A parametric study was performed to analyse the energy output and financial consequences of varying row distances and inclination angles of a solar system on a flat roof. Results indicated that, in order to maximise energy production, the inclination of the panels should be 0\u00b0 and rows should be placed directly next to each other.  In the future, facades may become an appropriate place to harvest solar energy. To assess the solar potential of a facade, a tool called FASSADES was developed. This tool consists of four steps: 1) an hourly irradiation analysis, 2) calculation of the photovoltaic/solar thermal output, 3) calcula\u00action of the economic value of the energy production, and 4) calculation of the payback time.  Urban planners can create a favourable environment for solar energy by designing a solar-friendly zoning plan. A parametric study examined how design decisions \u2013 density, orientation, roof shape and design \u2013 taken in the urban planning phase affect the solar potential. Density was found to be the most sensitive parameter and, for higher densities, the study showed that attaining a net zero energy balance is difficult.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1833437333"}}

This thesis focuses on using photovoltaic produced electricity to power air conditioners in a tropical climate. The study takes place in Surabaya, Indonesia at two different locations the classroom, located at the UBAYA campus and the home office, 10 km away. Indonesia has an average solar irradiation of about 4.8 kWh/m\u00b2/day (PWC Indonesia, 2013) which is for ideal conditions for these tests.At the home office, tests were conducted on different photovoltaic systems. A series of measuring devices recorded the performance of the 800 W PV system and the consumption of the 1.35 kW air conditioner (cooling capacity). To have an off grid system many of the components need to be oversized. The inverter has to be oversized to meet the startup load of the air conditioner, which can be 3 to 8 times the operating power (Rozenblat, 2013). High energy consumption of the air conditioner would require a large battery storage to provide one day of autonomy. The PV systems output must at least match the consumption of the air conditioner.A grid connect system provides a much better solution with the 800 W PV system providing 80 % of the 3.5 kWh load of the air conditioner, the other 20 % coming from the grid during periods of low irradiation. In this system the startup load is provided by the grid so the inverter does not need to be oversized. With the grid-connected system, the PV panel\u2019s production does not need to match the consumption of the air conditioner, although a smaller PV array will mean a smaller percentage of the load will be covered by PV.Using the results from the home office tests and results from measurements made in the classroom. Two different PV systems (8 kW and 12 kW) were simulated to power both the current air conditioners (COP 2.78) and new air conditioners (COP 4.0). The payback period of the systems can vary greatly depending on if a feed in tariff is awarded or not. If the feed in tariff is awarded the best system is the 12 kW system, with a payback period of 4.3 years and a levelized cost of energy at -3,334 IDR/kWh. If the feed in tariff is not granted then the 8 kW system is the best choice with a lower payback period and lower levelized cost of energy than the 12 kW system under the same conditions.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1843864505"}}

Energy and environment have become the two predominant scientific research areas in the 21st century, and in some ways they are closely interconnected. Fossil fuels can no longer represent the predominant energy supply for human being. Their use must be reduced and alternative sustainable energy resources have to be identified and rapidly exploited. In the coming decades, the exploited energy sources will not only affect economy and politics but, in fact, health itself. The most direct and obvious effect derived from the current intensive use of fossil fuels is linked to the global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The World Health Organization has recently estimated an increase of five million patients and 150,000 deaths per year resulting from the recent global temperature increase. Indirect effects are also important, such as the increase of infectious diseases transmitted by insects (especially malaria) and the deterioration of overall health due to malnutrition, as a direct consequence of drought and famine. Finally, the continuous use of fossil fuels boosts global pollution, which in turn significantly increases the mortality for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Global energy supply system must be urgently reassessed exploiting the use of clean energy sources. To this purpose, investments for the development of renewable energy resources are increasing worldwide, with particular attention to the most mature technologies such as hydro, wind and solar power. In particular, photovoltaics stands out as the most effective technology to be intensively exploited, especially if one considers that the total solar energy absorbed by Earth in one hour is higher than the overall yearly energy use. Many different photovoltaic devices have been developed over the last sixty years, and the large-scale production of solar panels having good efficiencies has begun in the last decade and is rapidly growing. The major goal is to find a trade-off between efficiency, stability, cost and environmental impact of the solar cells. This has led to a lively scientific research in this direction, in a multidisciplinary environment that includes materials scientists, electronic engineers, technologists and experts of life cycle assessment. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a photoelectrochemical device proposed in 1991, composed of widely available and cheap materials. Due to its ease of manufacture, versatility in the choice of components, good efficiency even in the presence of low irradiation level and adaptability to flexible substrates, DSSC has received considerable attention from the scientific community. However, despite the record efficiency of 13% and the recent large-scale industrial production, DSSCs still suffer from poor long-term stability, mainly due to the presence of the volatile liquid electrolyte as well as photosensitive organic components. In such a scenario, the scope of this PhD Thesis is the development of innovative quasi-solid electrolytes and external coatings where specifically designed polymeric networks are able to impart both high stability and efficiency to the resulting DSSCs. In Chapter 1 the current global energy scenario is thoroughly presented, along with an overview of the technologies developed for the conversion of solar energy into electricity. The physical parameters useful for the evaluation of the photovoltaic device performance are detailed and the state of art efficiencies so far achieved by means of the current technologies are reviewed. Chapter 2 deals with the basic concepts for DSSCs; cell architectures, components and operating principle are detailed. The specific characterization methodologies developed for the study of DSSCs are also described. Chapter 3 is focused on DSSC stability, which represents a key issue of the current solar energy research. The two main strategies to achieve stable DSSCs (i.e., the replacement of liquid electrolytes with polymeric ones and the introduction of external multifunctional polymeric coatings) are reviewed. As regards the preparation of these materials, photopolymerization is presented as one of the most promising technique due to its unique features such as rapidity and environmental friendliness, which are highly desired in a low impact and cheap technology like DSSC. The experimental part of this Thesis deals with the research work carried out on the preparation, characterization and testing of photopolymerized electrolytes and coatings. Both of these components have been investigated by means of an approach that started with the identification of suitable UV-curable monomers, followed by the study of the relationship between materials and devices performance, and concluded with the optimization through the introduction of particular additives able to give the material a multifunctional feature. In Chapter 4 the preparation and characterization techniques used for the fabrication and analysis of cell components and devices are briefly described. The experimental work has been carried out in the Center for Space Human Robotics (Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Torino) and in the Department of Applied Science and Technology (Politecnico di Torino). In Chapter 5, UV-crosslinked polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) are proposed and demonstrated as efficient and stable DSSC electrolytes. Physico-chemical, thermal, viscoelastic and electrochemical techniques are used to investigate the correlation between chemical structure of PEMs and resulting DSSC performance, with a special focus on the transport phenomena within PEMs as well as at the interface with the cell electrodes. The experimental conditions for the preparation of the polymer electrolyte are optimized by a design of experiments approach, which is used in the DSSC research field for the first time. Light-to-electricity conversion efficiency values of the lab-scale DSSCs assembled with these polymer electrolytes are admirably almost equal to the corresponding liquid cells, moreover a remarkably better long-term stability is obtained. In Chapter 6, a step forward is proposed, where three unconventional approaches are exploited for the successful implementation of photocrosslinked PEMs, namely the fabrication of flexible devices, the preparation of PEMs having a gradient-tailored spatial composition and the in situ photopolymerization of electrolytes containing alternative redox couples. These three themes are definitely innovative in the DSSC field and represent important advances from a technological viewpoint. Since the use of functional fillers has been scarcely considered in the DSSCs literature so far, the idea of improving both cell efficiency and durability by their introduction in PEMs is proposed in Chapter 7. In this respect, metal-organic frameworks (MOF) and nanocellulose are introduced in UV-cured membranes, and their effect on photovoltaic and stability performance is investigated. In particular, a novel bio-sourced filler is demonstrated to cumulatively increase the photocurrent, the photovoltage and the long-term stability of a polymeric lab-scale DSSC. In Chapter 8, the protection of DSSCs from UV radiation and atmospheric agents by the application of photopolymerized coatings is proposed. Multifunctional coatings, able both to convert the harmful UV light into harvestable visible light by downshifting and to confer self-cleaning and water-repellent properties to the external side of the cells are investigated. For the first time, a general approach that simultaneously improves performance and weatherability of organic DSSC devices is presented, and it is noteworthy that these multipurpose coatings are obtained by means of a rapid and up-scalable photopolymerization process", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1968207593"}}

The demand for cooling and air-conditioning of building is increasingly ever growing. This increase is mostly due to population and economic growth in developing countries, and also desire for a higher quality of thermal comfort. Increase in the use of conventional cooling systems results in larger carbon footprint and more greenhouse gases considering their higher electricity consumption, and it occasionally creates peaks in electricity demand from power supply grid. Solar energy as a renewable energy source is an alternative to drive the cooling machines since the cooling load is generally high when solar radiation is high.This thesis examines the performance of PV/T solar collector manufactured by Solarus company in a solar cooling system for an office building in Dubai, New Delhi, Los Angeles and Cape Town. The study is carried out by analyzing climate data and the requirements for thermal comfort in office buildings. Cooling systems strongly depend on weather conditions and local climate. Cooling load of buildings depend on many parameters such as ambient temperature, indoor comfort temperature, solar gain to the building and internal gains including; number of occupant and electrical devices.The simulations were carried out by selecting a suitable thermally driven chiller and modeling it with PV/T solar collector in Polysun software. Fractional primary energy saving and solar fraction were introduced as key figures of the project to evaluate the performance of cooling system. Several parametric studies and simulations were determined according to PV/T aperture area and hot water storage tank volume.The fractional primary energy saving analysis revealed that thermally driven chillers, particularly adsorption chillers are not suitable to be utilizing in small size of solar cooling systems in hot and tropic climates such as Dubai and New Delhi. Adsorption chillers require more thermal energy to meet the cooling load in hot and dry climates. The adsorption chillers operate in their full capacity and in higher coefficient of performance when they run in a moderate climate since they can properly reject the exhaust heat. The simulation results also indicated that PV/T solar collector have higher efficiency in warmer climates, however it requires a larger size of PV/T collectors to supply the thermally driven chillers for providing cooling in hot climates. Therefore using an electrical chiller as backup gives much better results in terms of primary energy savings, since PV/T electrical production also can be used for backup electrical chiller in a net metering mechanism.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2172764110"}}

This study presents the effect of ratio of heat delivered by solar to the total heat delivered to an adsorption chiller (solar fraction) on the economic performance of a solar cooling system. This cooling system need covers cooling demand for an office building in a tropical region (Kuala Lumpur). Cooling demand was simulated using well-known energy analysis software for building, Equest. Flat-plate collectors and an adsorption chiller were the main component of the cooling system. Flat-plate collecters were simulated using another software, Watsun, and the adsorption chiller was based on our simulation model that is comparable with other studies. Economic performance was analyzed by life cycle cost analysis. Solar fraction of 0.33, 0.74 and 0.98 were studied. It was found that none of the solar fraction studied can generate Net Profit under subsidized electricity. It was also found that a natural gas boiler is a better solution than an electric heater as an auxiliary heater in term of economic. For a natural gas boiler, Net Profit increased when solar fraction decreased; the highest one was solar fraction of 0.33 with US$15,600. However, since more energy is used for the auxiliary heater in lower solar fraction, more emissions is expected to be released.

Boverket, a governmental agency in Sweden, has the goal to regulate so that all new buildings will be near zero energy buildings from 2020 and one way to reach this goal is to install a solar photovoltaic (solar PV) system on the building. Commercial buildings, such as office buildings, usually have a daily electricity use profile that is well matched with electricity generation from a solar PV system. The price for solar PV today is about a fifth of the price in 2006. Under these conditions, it is interesting to investigate the potential for using solar PV in Swedish office buildings. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the economic feasibility for solar PV in Swedish office building from a technical, economical and legal perspective. The purpose is also to investigate existing PV system installations in office buildings. These purposes are processed with help of a number of research objectives where load profiles were studied for buildings with different cooling systems, evaluation of existing PV systems and an economic analysis of PV systems with different locations, orientations, slope angles for different load curves were performed. The research objectives were examined with a case study approach. Measured data for property electricity load and electricity generation from existing PV systems for five different office buildings was examined. An analysis of the matching of electricity load and electricity generation for existing PV systems for five buildings was made in order to investigate how the systems were sized and mounted with respect to the available roof space, roof conditions and electricity load for the buildings. The electricity load data was then used in the study where simulated electricity generation for different system configurations with different slope angles, orientations and azimuth angles were matched with the property electricity load profiles for the examined buildings. This matching was then used in an economic evaluation with today\u00b4s technical, legal and economic conditions to evaluate how different system configuration affects the profitability. The conclusions that could be drawn from this study are that a PV system investment can be profitable with today\u00b4s conditions from a property owner\u2019s perspective and that the choice of slope and azimuth angles for a PV installation is important for the profitability. There is an optimal system size in terms of profitability which is different for different electricity load profiles. At this optimum there was some percent of overproduction. An increased use of solar PV in Sweden is possible; the technical, legal and economic conditions are today good enough. However, a study including a larger number of buildings corresponding to typical Swedish office buildings is required to draw any general conclusions regarding the potential of solar PV.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2236932069"}}

Undoubtedly, more focus is given to renewable energy sources in recent times. Researchers and practitioners unite in expectations of a growth in solar energy installed capacity in Sweden during the coming years. Nonetheless, sustainable energy sources merely represent acomparatively small portion of total Swedish energy production. As such, a significant increase of this proportion is crucial in order to meet the UN directive goals. This study focuses on photovoltaic energy utilization on Swedish multifamily buildings with tenancy right and tenant ownership in Stockholm. A case study is done on a multifamily building at the campus of Royal Institute of Technology. Potential amount of energy produced from 70 photovoltaic panels has been calculated in two different states; one with solar panels mounted on rooftop standings in an optimum angle towards the sun, and the other with solar panels mounted directly on the rooftop facing up. Assuming a life time of 25 years and a 5 percent cost of capital the net present value for the investment has been calculated to 15 000 SEK with solar panels mounted directly on the rooftop and 10 000 SEK with panels mounted on standings. Payback time for both cases has been calculated to approximately 13 years. This study shows that there are different incentives for an investment in a photovoltaic solar farm depending on the tenure of the apartment building and whether it is a new- or reconstruction. Housing cooperatives with stable economy has the strongest incentives for implementing solar energy since it will contribute to lower operating cost of the building, which can result in lower monthly fees for households and increase the market value of the apartments. Due to the long-term ownership the housing cooperatives are paying for the investment and the households also take part of the savings. The property owner of an multifamily building with tenancy right invests in the solar farm and takes part of the savings due to lower operating costs during a rebuilding. The households are not affected economically. If the solar cells are implemented during a new construction there is possible to decrease the cost of installation and it is easier to construct an appealing building. Initially the construction company invests in the solar farm and the owner of the property is obtaining lower operating costs. However, the construction company expects to earn their investment back in connection with the sale of the apartment building.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2238069242"}}

The solar architecture is defined as a kind of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) which the PV modules are deployed to a passive solar concepts, to minimize the heating & cooling load, to upgrade the indoor environmental quality and to be adjustable for regional weather and to continuously succeed architectural culture and history. The most ideal form of a BIPV is a multi functional and ecological convergence through a passive concept application of photovoltaic module for a building. The solar architecture need to consider the architectural culture and history of the region through an ecological convergence which is applicable to a passive concept, if the environmental, energy and comfort problems will be effectively mitigated. The evaluation standard is needed to fulfill these requirements of the solar architecture. The renewable energy sources are getting very hot issues, due to the environmental pollution, global warming and energy shortage etc. It is reasonable to disseminate the representative energy systems which could be ecologically convergent with the regional architecture. Almost renewable energy systems including PV could not be activate or not be environmental friendly, if the systems are planned simply without multi functional and ecological convergence and any assistances or incentives.

Solar assisted air conditioning systems are environmentally friendly by being constructed in a way that minimises the need for chlorofluorocarbons CFC, Hydro chlorofluorocarbons HCFC or Chlorofluorocarbons HFC refrigerants and by using a low grade thermal renewable energy, therefore, making them energy efficient and environmentally safe.

The behaviour of a solar-driven, triple-effect absorption chiller with thermal storage, when serving an office building load, have been analysed in this paper. Characteristic equations for the triple effect chiller have been developed from their operating performance data. The effect of different control strategies and design parameters on the annual performance of the system have been captured in this paper. These results indicate that it is possible to achieve very high solar fractions (> 0.9) by choosing the right size of system components and a suitable control strategy.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2275301366"}}

European energy directives define highly-demanding performance standards, from zero-energy buildings to positive-energy buildings. In Switzerland, one of the specific objectives of the new \u201cEnergy strategy 2050\u201d is to install PV systems on existing building surfaces in order to cover 1/3 of the annual Swiss demand for electricity. In view of the considerable importance of urban renewal processes, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems therefore provide a crucial response to the challenges of the energy turnaround. However, in spite of technologic progress and economic evolution, diverse types of obstacles limit a large-scale advanced PV integration into urban renewal processes. In this context, urban and architectural design towards increased integration \u2013 and therefore increased acceptance \u2013 provides an essential solution to overcome these barriers. It represents a key element towards establishing a systematic link between BIPV and the necessary renewal of the considerable existing building stock.

The energetic issues are on the top of the political agenda in many countries, for environmental reasons, for its driving role in all the economic sectors, as well as for the energetic independency concerns. This problematic is stressed by the increasing weight of renewable intermittent power sources in the global mix. In particular, due to its high potential and the strong national policy support it beneficiated, solar photovoltaic energy is now a key player in the world energy mutation and the way it is integrated into the global mix should be carefully performed. To deeply understand the way the solar energy can penetrate and transform the forthcoming energy framework, we adopted a three-level strategy to provide some answers to the following questions: i/ how can we situate the photovoltaic power role in future energy mixes?; ii/due to its main drawback, intermittency, could we provide an optimal design of a system combining storage devices?; iii/ what is the efficiency of the incentive policies that are or have been implemented to accelerate its deployment? That is why, in a first part, the peculiar position of the solar photovoltaic energy in the energy mix is analyzed. After recalling the general issue of future global energetic mixes, we propose a brief description of the different photovoltaic technologies and their promising evolutions in terms of technical improvements and cost reductions. Then, we describe the fast growing photovoltaic market and its consequences both on the electricity mix and the industry sector. In the second part we investigate the problematic of integrating such intermittent energy in the electricity mix, by developing a multi-criteria optimization methodology which simulates a system composed of photovoltaic panels and storage devices. Applications on a real case in the Cirque de Mafate (L\u2019ile de la Reunion, France) are provided to illustrate the interest of our method. Finally, we question the efficiency of different public supports to the photovoltaic technologies in the most relevant countries. We focus on correlating the installed power capacity with the spent public money and the electricity prices. In these works, we put into relief the necessity to consider energy issues through the prism of technical basis. Indeed, solutions that cannot be efficient should not be implemented in the system. However, a solely technical treatment of energy challenges is obviously insufficient, since energy is core point for the economy, for the citizen and so for the politician.

This paper focuses on the performance of the 56kWp PV installation of the north facing elevation of the library at the South Street campus of Murdoch University. This installation was the first step in Murdoch University\u2019s goal to becoming the first privately owned solar power station and the largest PV installation in Perth, Western Australia [1]. In order to perform this analysis, it has been essential to gather output data for the installation from the data acquisition program, which operates around the clock recording this data from the array inverters. A crucial step was to collect weather and meteorological data from sources on the Murdoch campus, this data was used in the performance analysis in order to calculate system loss, efficiency and overall system performance.   This analysis was performed in order to gain a better understanding of the subject matter of solar generation. There are still aspects of large scale solar power generation which are yet to be studied more extensively. This report is centred around the 56kWp solar generator located at Murdoch University\u2019s South Street campus, to enable to University to gain a better understanding of the total power being produced from the system. It is also important to recognise where there is room for improvement in design and application through the study into areas such as soiling, shading and general performance characteristics. This report will allow the University to make an educated and informed decision on any future upgrades or extensions onto the existing system.   Data acquired from the array was used to show how it performs in many different environmental conditions, through the use of modelling programs such as PVSyst and data graphing programs such as Microsoft Excel. By plotting output power data against temperature, rainfall, time of day and output voltage comparison graphs can be produced that allow readers to visualize and understand exactly how each characteristic affects the performance of PV systems in the Perth metropolitan region.   Through this project the array performance characteristics were evaluated. It was found that the array has an average performance ratio of 0.85 for 2014, and that the array does indeed perform well in the Perth region. It was also found that shading impacts the array in a very noticeable way, this shows up as a noticeable depression on the affected inverters. Following through on a soiling study it was found that the array does indeed suffer from the soiling effect, most notably during long periods of dry weather. Degradation effects were also studied during the project but no evidence of these effects were found, these effects will be more prevalent in a longer period of study.   These findings are significant because it allows for a comparison with other arrays in the Perth demographic, the typical array performance ratios in the Perth region is approximately 0.8 [2] [3], from this it can be concluded that the Murdoch array performs better than expected for the region. Shading impacts PV generation and this is evident in the array data. It can also lead to more significant issues such as hot spots and module damage and this can become a costly problem. Soiling has been proven in this scenario to reduce the overall performance of the array, this has been shown through a slow reduction in performance over a long dry period then an increase after a period of heavy rain. Degradation is the biggest issue affecting PV arrays around the world, the cells in the modules experience an aging effect and see a reduction in performance. The Murdoch array has not yet shown signs of degradation in the analysis period of this report of five years, this is indicative of the quality of the installation and the cell manufacturing quality.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2340123213"}}

Responding directly to the building\u2019s needs, such systems replace conventional materials for the building envelope and generate power at the same time, improving the eco-efficiency of the building.  Through the use of simulation software like Design Builder and Sam (System Advisor Model) and calculations, the present study aims to suggest renovation solutions of a building\u2019s envelope, using energy systems (building integrated photovoltaics), for a multi-family building, situated in Malmo, Sweden.

Urban planners lack knowledge of how solar potential of buildings is affected by the decisions taken at an early design phase. Therefore, the solar potential metric SAFARn was analysed and the development of a tool for assessing the solar potential of buildings for integration of photovoltaic panels was studied in order to provide architects and urban planners with necessary information regarding solar energy. The research investigated where the most suitable building surfaces to generate solar energy are and how this is affected by the building size, shape and the surrounding building context. The study was based on residential buildings located in Malmo, Sweden. The results showed that for such a location and climatic conditions only the roof and the facade surfaces that have orientation close to the absolute south can be considered suitable. The building shape, size and urban surroundings demonstrated to be determining factors for the potential for solar energy generation. Considering the surrounding context, the results suggested that wider streets allow more solar radiation to reach the buildings. Additionally, the facades are very susceptible to overshadowing, so the dimension of the street and the height of the neighboring buildings really determine how well can the facade be used for harvesting solar energy. On the other hand, the roof solar potential is generally less affected by the surrounding layout. Investigating the neighboring buildings\u2019 facade materials with different light reflectance properties showed that high reflectance materials increase the solar radiation on the examined building\u2019s surfaces. Other less reflective surfaces showed to have a slightly negative effect on the irradiation. Finally, a large potential for locally produced solar energy was identified. Moreover in this study, a building assessment tool for solar energy design based on the program Grasshopper was developed in order to assist urban planners to take more informed decisions during early design stage. The tool proved to be capable of providing predictions about the amount and the location of a building\u2019s suitable area, placement and size of the solar energy system, as well as the amount of electricity that the system can produce and subsequently how much of the building\u2019s electricity need can be covered. The tool was also able to provide adequate visual and numerical feedback on the results. In order to fulfill the aims of this study, necessary parameters and settings regarding urban metrics, threshold values for solar irradiation that falls on the building surfaces had to be prepared for carrying on with simulations. Moreover, a step-by-step workflow of the simulations was introduced, describing all decisions and the arguments for them. The findings of this study can be beneficial to achieve a higher solar potential when buildings or urban districts are planned and buildings\u2019 shape, height, dimension of the streets and other aspects are decided. Architects and urban planners will benefit from using the solar energy assessment tool by being able to quickly and precisely assess their proposed design and see how a potential solar energy installation will perform.

BIPV demand is growing due to expansion of the green energy proportion of the building according to social interests, the global warming and increasement of high-rise buildings. 99% of the modules that are currently used in the BIPV are opaque silicon solar cell so that it limits to the needs of different architectural designs. Dye-sensitized solar cell, depending on the type of light-sensitive dyes, can be colored. and since it can easily has the semi-transmissive characteristics and fansy design, it is the most suitable for solar in BIPV market. The dye-sensitized solar cell module itself can not be used as exterior materials of buildings so that panels is required by using a sealing material. In the case of a PVB Sheet used as a sealing material of the silicon solar cell, it requires high temperature and high pressure process. so it is possible to generate a thermal damage to the dye-sensitized solar cell module using the organic material, take manufacturing time and high production cost. Also, since the thickness of the dye-sensitized solar cell module is 4.4mm - 5.0mm, PVB Sheet with 0.76mm being optionally commercialized, it is difficult to use. Therefore, Ltd.

This thesis presents the design of a solar energy product-service-experience combination that could provide solar energy a new product meaning and perhaps encourage Dutch consumers to use (more) solar energy. The project was initiated by the start-up Googreen as a means to explore suitable business opportunities for the company to enter the solar energy industry in the Netherlands. The findings of the extensive analyses of the current context, the trends and developments in the Dutch society have led to the emergence of a new context for the design: People\u2019s energy replenishing moments and the selection of the target segment: the young professionals. After having investigated this new context and the defined target segment, an elaborate ideation and conceptualisation process was conducted and led to the design of Sunight. Sunight is basically a solar powered lighting fixture for the indoor environment with a DIY concept and modular system. The product can be easily mounted on surfaces such as the walls and ceilings or be used as a flexible and portable light source as well. In addition, Sunight is also equipped with a remote control function, allowing users to for instance turn the modules on or off with their smart devices. The current state of the design is still very conceptual. Further developments are needed to make the DIY construction as smooth as possible in order to minimise failure rates and to review if the construction now is strong enough or not. The current way to mount the light fixture on the walls is not optimal and should be studied further as well. After a rough cost price estimation, it is evident that the start-up should further examine the design to reduce the production costs. In addition to conducting a more elaborate user validation study, the company should also devise more revenue streams and ways to stay competitive in order to increase the success rates of the venture.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2592252492"}}

Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) is about multifunctional building elements that generate electricity. BIPV therefore brings the worlds of construction and photovoltaics together with all the challenges and chances inherent to such a change of paradigm. After more than 20 years of R&D, the market for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) has kicked off with very interesting products and elegant showcase projects. The birth of this market has been based on an enormous progress in PV technology development (cost-wise and performance-wise), together with the vision of some leading architects and industries. Today the European BIPV market is supported by approximately 200 commercially available products. The SUPSI-SEAC report 2015 gives a comprehensive overview of BIPV, its product classification, its price levels, its available products and its example projects. The report starts off with an adapted classification of BIPV systems according to the most recent developments in the market. We believe that this classification system serves the purpose of understanding the market segmentation and the product segmentation in BIPV. Three main application areas are distinguished: Pitched roofs, flat & curved roofs and facades. The application areas are sub-divided into thirteen different product categories. A short description and a photograph of an application is given per product category. Next, we investigate the price levels for the various product categories. The investigation was made by asking Dutch and Swiss BIPV installers to quote on a fictional building. PV products were found to be priced about 200 \u20ac/m2 above conventional roof products like tiles or shingles. In facade systems, this is different. PV products were priced very similar to conventional facades made from materials like wood, stone or glass. A major factor in the price levels of the BIPV applications was whether standard size PV panels or nonstandard size PV panels were used. In the first case BIPV pricing could come close to conventional PV pricing. In the second case the price could be a factor 3 higher than conventional PV applications. We also present our updated database of BIPV products available. It consists of 108 BIPV products that are commercially available in Europe, with a focus on the Dutch and Swiss markets. The database evolved out of the networks of SEAC and SUPSI together with results of our internet search and trade fair visits. In earlier publications, the market analysis made through the database of the SUPSI website and the published BIPV report by SEAC showed that the most common products for roof applications were \u201cIn-roof mounting systems\u201d, while \u201csolar glazing\u201d and \u201ccold facades\u201d (\u201dcladding\u201d) represented the majority of facade applications. In this new analysis, we find that the most abundantly populated product categories are \u201cFull roof solution\u201d and \u201cSolar glazing\u201d. The least occupied product groups are \u201cPV membranes\u201d, \u201cMetal panels\u201d and \u201cWarm facades\u201d. Judging from the sheer amount of products available, rooftop applications have the largest market share within BIPV. In the utility and commercial segments, facade BIPV systems are expected to gain importance. The key market driver for this segment is the European Directive 2010/31/EU, which states that each new building should be made \u2018nearly zero energy\u2019 from 2020 onwards. Facade PV systems are essential to meet this demand, as in many utility and commercial buildings the roof is simply not large enough to generate all the required energy. The dominant PV technology in BIPV is found to be crystalline silicon (c-Si). Nonetheless, relatively high market shares for thin film technology of up to 25% are found. Thin film PV technology is getting significant attention especially in facade systems, because of its homogeneous color (black) appearance and a lower price per m2. A potential market opportunity lies in lightweight flexible thin film products for application on curved surfaces and flat roofs with small weight capacity. Many example projects can be found, but commercially available products are not easy to find, and do not appear in this year\u2019s database. Eight examples of BIPV projects are described from various product categories and application areas. We hope these existing projects will serve as catalysts, from which more architects, construction companies and end-users will get stimulated to apply BIPV solutions in their buildings. Finally, we wish to look ahead towards a successful BIPV future. In our vision, the further development of the BIPV market in Europe will depend on a number of key factors. Three of those factors are related to a stable predictable market situation:  \u25c6 A stable and predictable roadmap of building directives and regulations: BIPV as the way to meet energy regulations for buildings and at the same time satisfy value drivers in the building industry (investor\u2019s value, architectural quality, comfort); \u25c6 Development of European harmonized standards, technical rules and building codes in order to allow BIPV products to address the complete European market; A stable and predictable roadmap of financial incentives (market stimulation) for PV application in general.  Other success factors are related to product positioning, supply chain and cooperation between sectors:  \u25c6 Concerted efforts by players in the BIPV supply chain to work together in accordance with a collaborative and integral design/building process. BIPV will require not only a technological integration but an integration in the whole building process; \u25c6 Smart engineering and manufacturing of BIPV products such that low cost (\u20ac/Wp as well as \u20ac/m 2) can be combined with the high mix requirements from the building market. In the meantime, a way to approach the price-challenge would be to sell BIPV in a \u201cirrational way\u201d. That is as a feel-good product, a fashion product and/or a status product. This will take the buying decision away from considerations like payback time. \u25c6 A broad support and acceptance of the central BIPV vision: i.e. that BIPV can be considered as a building material producing energy; \u25c6 Europe is a front runner in policy development on sustainability (building codes, incentives). Furthermore the European industry is well positioned as a supplier of high mix product offerings based on smart engineering and innovative technology. Therefore we believe that BIPV is a very promising product-market combination for European industry!", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2686162312"}}

Nowadays, the necessity of having air conditioner at our home was highly demand at home and in public areas due to the large demand for comfort in the thermal environment of living space in modern society. Since the demand of the air conditioner had increase from year to year and the air conditioner had consumed big amount of electricity to operate, a new system of air conditioner has been discovered and developed which is by adding solar energy. Air-conditioner consumes almost 50% of the primary energy supplied to a building. The cooler the temperature, the bigger the energy or electricity needed to run the airconditioner. 60 % of the power consumed by the air conditioner is used by the compressor whereas the other 40% is used to operate other components in air conditioning. Therefore, by decreasing the consumption of electricity by the compressor may decrease the power consumption of an air-conditioner. This report discusses a new system of air-conditioning to decrease the power consumption that uses the heat energy from the solar collector to support and enhance the heating of refrigerant, thus decrease the work load of the compressor.

In this benchmark we investigated the price levels of the Building Integrated Photo-Voltaics (BIPV) market in the Netherlands. There is a broad scope of different BIPV applications (e.g. roofing, facades, skylights, glazing, etc.). This study limited itself to the applications for pitched roofing in the Dutch residential sector. Two types of BIPV applications (tiles, in-roof systems) were compared to conventional roofing and conventional Building-Attached Photo-Voltaic (BAPV) roofing solutions. Suppliers of BIPV systems were invited to quote on a virtual home with the target to make the house net electricity zero. Two virtual homes were defined. The first virtual home was a terraced house with 60 m2 roof area and 3300 kWh/a electricity usage. The second virtual home was a detached house with 125 m2 of roof area and 4600 kWh/a electricity usage. The quotes were split up in various categories including electrical connection costs (cables, inverter, AC connection), PV installation costs, PV fastening system costs, PV panels costs, Installation costs, and conventional roofing materials costs. In total, 11 quotes for BIPV systems were received. These were well-distributed over the two categories of BIPV in-roof systems and BIPV tiles. In addition, 8 quotes on conventional BAPV systems were gathered for price comparison. It was chosen to report the turn-key prices for the full roof upgrade rather than the common unit of \u20ac/Wp, because only in this way a clean comparison between the various solutions to make the house net electricity neutral could be made. From the analysis of the prices, the following key conclusions can be drawn: - Turn-key prices for retrofitting a BAPV system and make the house net electricity neutral are \u20ac6,000 for a terraced and \u20ac8,000 for a detached house. BIPV in-roof mounting systems add \u20ac2,500 to these costs, due to three main effects: o Additional labour is required due to the removal of the existing roof tiles. o Suppliers of BIPV in-roof mounting systems tend to choose high quality European brand PV panels in their systems, whereas BAPV system suppliers tend to choose low-cost Asian brand PV panels. o More costs are made in the installation process, due to a more complicated and slower installation process than BAPV systems. - Turn-key prices for renovating a full roof and then adding a BAPV system to make the house net electricity neutral are \u20ac10,000 for a terraced and \u20ac16,000 for a detached house. BIPV in-roof mounting systems add \u20ac1,000 to these costs. Cost savings are made for requiring less roof tiles, but additional expenses are needed for the use of more expensive high quality brand PV panels and longer installation times required. - Several suppliers of BIPV tiles are active on the Dutch market. Their products are meant to blend better into the roof\u2019s optical appearance and consequently improve the overall aesthetical quality of the house. A large price spread within the products that are offered exists. The cheapest BIPV tile solution for a turn-key roof renovation was \u20ac14,000 euro for a terraced and \u20ac21,000 euro for a detached house. The most expensive solution was \u20ac23,000 euro for a terraced and \u20ac35,000 euro for a detached house. The large price range suggests a proto niche market or sub-segmentation within this product group. - Comparing the dwelling types with each other we see an overall price advantage in favour for larger roof systems. The electricity producing roof on a detached house was approx. 20% cheaper per m2 than the same system on a terraced house, for all three system types of BAPV, BIPV in-roof systems and BIPV tiles.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3012215210"}}

Recently, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) modules have attracted great attention since they can not only be a part of building materials but also generate electric power. Among many types of BIPV modules, translucent hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar module has expand the range of applications to include windows, sunroofs and skylights, where it can be useful for both purpose of generating electricity and transparency for sunlight at the day time. There are two main types of translucent a-Si PV modules. The first one builds with a transparent conductive oxide thin film, instead of the metal film, as the back electrode. However, this type of module only allows light with wavelengths longer than 500 nm to pass through, leading to a reddish light and therefore visual discomfort. The other type translucent a-Si PV module uses the so-called ?P4 laser process? to remove silicon and back electrode layers so as to allow nature light transmission. In this study, 10% transmittance a-Si:H thin film solar modules are fabricated by laser processes. Effects of P4 laser line width and scribing directions, vertical, spot-like and horizontal in relation to the modules, are investigated. Firstly for the P4 laser line width optimization from 30-60 \u00b5m, the experimental result shows that with a constant transmittance, a module having a large line width could improve fill factor and conversion efficiency due to reduction of scribed line number needed, thus decreasing the damage of silicon layers. The 60 \u00b5m P4 laser line width leads to a minimum of performance degradation of about 11%. Further increasing the line width may need to introduce additional optical lens system to change laser beam distribution. Secondly, I-V curves and parameters of the modules fabricated using three different scribing directions show that the vertically scribed module has a high series resistance of 19.3 ? due to the long carrier transport length and small cross-sectional area. The spot-like module has the highest leakage current and diode ideality factor, indicating a reduced silicon film quality. This is likely due to spot-like scribing creating the largest amount of laser line edges, which usually contains high defects caused by laser thermal affection. The horizontally scribed module has the best fill factor, and the intermediate open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current. Finally, the horizontal scribing can lead to the lowest conversion efficiency degradation of about 12.7%.

In an era of significant environmental threats, increasing carbondioxide emissions and rising electricity demand, it is important that the development of cheap and efficient renewable energy continues around the world to compete against cheaper, non-renewable, energy sources. To do this, the development of solar power have to continute so that countries and companies choose to invest solar power insteed of non-renewable energy. More specifically, it can be done through the development of new, more efficient, solar cells modules.In this study, a new sort of solar cell module, SmartPlus - developed by Innotech Solar, is compared to their standard module EcoPlus to investigate whether the new module may contribute to the higher proportion of solar-generated electricity in Sweden and there by reducing carbondioxide emissions. The new photovoltaic module is designed to take better advantage of the solar radiation when a portion of the module is exposed to shade, therefore will this study simulating the two modules in a solar panel plant where there is internal shading between the rows. Shading of photovoltaic modules currently leads to substantial losses in electricity generation because of the modules design and the purpose of the study is to investigate whether the new photovoltaic module are more efficient than the standard solar module that currently is in use.The aim of the study is to create and verify a simulation model and simulate a solar park in Sweden where the results variation depends on the spacing between the rows in the solar panel plant and if the modules are vertically or horizontally positioned to provide a variety of shading.The solar park that provides maximum power generation is a solar park with SmartPlus modules with horizontal position, but since the availability of land is often a limiting factor the vertical position should always be preferred. The result shows that when choosing module to a solar the choice between SmartPlus and EcoPlus is not the most important factor. Even though SmartPlus consistently has a higher electricity production on an annual basis, the difference is marginal to EcoPlus, however, factors such as row spacing and module placement have a far greater impact on electricity generation and efficiency of the solar panel plant.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W565517357"}}

Heavy roistering in city areas has been a perpetual feature in some states. Many of the dwellers of small cities have come to depend on what is called an 'inverter' and its associated battery based storage system to cope up with the frequent power outages. Seen from another perspective these systems only lack the solar panels to become completely self contained power systems. Thus addition of solar panels to these will be only an incremental cost.

Experiments were conducted with the prototype TPV boiler so as to evaluate various issues related to this new technology. The electric output of TPV modules installed in the boiler was characterized under different operating conditions. The TPV cell modules generated 246.4\u00a0W at an emitter temperature of 1265\u00a0\u00b0C, which would be enough to power the electrical components of the whole heating system. Moreover, such a TPV integrated boiler could be employed to form a micro-CHP system in residential homes, providing an effective means for primary energy savings, on-site power and energy security.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2143564681"}}

The mission of the Center for Energy Efficient Materials (CEEM) was to serve the Department of Energy and the nation as a center of excellence dedicated to advancing basic research in nano-structured materials and devices for applications to solar electricity, thermoelectric conversion of waste heat to electricity, and solidstate lighting. The foundation of CEEM was based on the unique capabilities of UCSB and its partner institutions to control, synthesize, characterize, model, and apply materials at the nanoscale for more efficient sustainable energy resources. This unique expertise was a key source of the synergy that unified the research of the Center. Although the Center\u2019s focus was basic research, It\u2019s longer-term objective has been to transfer new materials and devices into the commercial sector where they will have a substantial impact on the nation\u2019s need for efficient sustainable energy resources. As one measure of the impact of the Center, two start-up companies were formed based on its research. In addition, Center participants published a total of 210 archival journal articles, of which 51 were exclusively sponsored by the DOE grant. The work of the Center was structured around four specific tasks: Organic Solar Cells, Solid-State Lighting, Thermoelectrics, and High Efficiency Multi-junction Photovoltaic devices. A brief summary of each follows \u2013 detailed descriptions are in Sections 4 & 5 of this report. Research supported through CEEM led to an important shift with respect to the choice of materials used for the fabrication of solution deposited organic solar cells. Solution deposition opens the opportunity to manufacture solar cells via economically-viable high throughput tools, such as roll to roll printing. Prior to CEEM, most organic semiconductors utilized for this purpose involved polymeric materials, which, although they can form thin films reliably, suffer from batch to batch variations due to the statistical nature of the chemical reactions that produce them. In response, the CEEM team developed well-defined molecular semiconductors that produce active layers with very high power conversion efficiencies, in other words they can convert a very high fraction of sunlight into useful electrical power. The fact that the semiconductor is formed from molecular species provides the basis for circumventing the unreliability of polymer counterparts and, as an additional bonus, allows one to attain much grater insight into the structure of the active layer. The latter is particularly important because efficient conversion is the result of a complex arrangement of two semiconductors that need to phase separate in a way akin to oil and water, but with domains that are described by nanoscale dimensions. CEEM was therefore able to provide deep insight into the influence of nanostructure, through the application of structural characterization tools and theoretical methods that describe how electrical charges migrate through the organic layer. Our research in light emitting diode (LED)-based solid state lighting (SSL) was directed at improving efficiency and reducing costs to enable the widespread deployment of economically-viable replacements for inefficient incandescent, halogen, and fluorescent-based lighting. Our specific focus was to advance the fundamental science and technology of light emitting diodes to both understand factors that limit efficiencies and to provide innovative and viable solutions to the current impediments. One of the main challenges we faced is the decrease in efficiency when LEDs are driven harder to increase light output---the so called \u201cdroop\u201d effect. It requires large emitting surfaces to reach a desired optical output, and necessitates the use of costly heat sinks, both of which increase the cost. We successfully reduced droop by growing LED crystals having non-conventional orientations. As recognized by the award of the 2014 Nobel prize to the inventors of the nitride LEDs (one of whom was a member of CEEM), LEDs already have a large societal impact in both developed (leading to large energy savings) and developing countries (bringing light where there is no electrical grid). The improvements in efficiency sought after in the CEEM project are key to a further impact of solid state lighting by LEDs with a projected doubling in efficiency by year 2020. Direct generation of electricity from heat has enormous promise for beneficial use of waste heat. But practical power generation directly from heat requires understanding and development of new and improved materials that will be more efficient and rugged than today\u2019s thermoelectric materials. To accomplish this goal CEEM has synthesized five distinct and promising new classes of thermoelectric materials: (a) nanoparticle arrays that are effective in maximizing electric power generation and reducing detrimental loss of heat; (b) nitride and (c) oxide thermal electric materials that are effective at high temperatures where much beneficial heat is available; (d) arrays of silicon nano-wires that integrate thermal electricity generation into silicon-based electronics and materials; and (e) chemically synthesized nanostructured compounds that are cost effective, earth abundant, and environmentally friendly. The further development of these thermoelectric sources of electricity could have revolutionary impact for society in the recovery of waste heat from sources such as power plants and automobile exhaust, where there could be significant associated energy saving. It could even, in the future, provide disruptive alternatives and replacements for today\u2019s internal combustion engines and could enable improved all-electric propulsion by the heat from shipboard nuclear reactors. The High Efficiency Multi-junction Photovoltaics task was a UCSB/NREL collaboration which bonded sub-cells from two different compound semiconductors material systems to make high efficiency multijunction solar cells for concentrating photovoltaic applications thathave substantially higher efficiency than single substrate cells made of elemental semiconductors such as silicon. This task required the development of new cell bonding methods with excellent coupling of both photons and electrons between the sub-cells. To accomplish this, we developed (1) GaInN solar cells with enhanced performance by using quantum-well absorbers and front-surface optical texturing, (2) a hybrid \"pillar-array\" bond which uses an array of metal pillars for electrical coupling, and (3) a \"hybrid moth-eye\" optical coating which combines the benefits of nano-imprinted moth-eye coatings and traditional multilayer coatings. The technical effectiveness was assessed by measurement of the photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells made using these techniques; the ultrahigh efficiencies targeted by this work are of compelling economic value for concentrating photovoltaics.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2276618940"}}

Specifically, certain characteristic parameters should be obtained for each different PV module suitable for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), some by direct or indirect measurements at the laboratory, and others by monitoring the element performance mounted in real operating conditions. In the case of  transparent building envelopes it is particularly important to perform an optical and thermal characterization of the PV modules that would be integrated in them. This paper addresses the optical characterization of some commercial thin-film PV modules having different degrees of transparency, suitable for building integration in facades. The approach is based on the measurement of the spectral UV/Vis/NIR reflectance and transmittance of the different considered samples, both at normal incidence and as a function of the angle of incidence. With the obtained results, the total and zoned UV, visible and NIR transmission and reflection values are calculated, enabling the correct characterization of the PV modules integrated in facades and the subsequent evaluation of their impact over the electrical, thermal and lighting performance in a building.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1899382358"}}

Facades are the central element in the design and architectural definition of contemporary buildings. Several solutions, with different aesthetical appeal, perform the finishing materials of existing building and new constructions. A sustainable design process today is intended to produce high-performance buildings that are energy-efficient, healthy and economically feasible, by wisely using renewable resources to minimize the impact on the environment and to reduce, as much as possible, the energy demand. For this reason, the facade system plays an important role for achieving these energy and environmental goals and Photovoltaic can play a leading role in this challenge. Relying on a vast database of products and building examples, collected in different research projects, a multi-criteria analysis has been performed to compare BIPV solutions with other technological possibilities for facade (either traditional than innovative), in terms of technological, architectural, energetic, environmental and economic requirements. As this study demonstrates, PV will be able to become an affordable alternative to conventional facades since a more precise information and a common language will be implemented and shared.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2197291535"}}

BIPV systems are small PV generation units spread out over the territory, and whose characteristics are very diverse. This makes difficult a cost-effective procedure for monitoring, fault detection, performance analyses, operation and maintenance. As a result, many problems affecting BIPV systems go undetected. In order to carry out effective automatic fault detection procedures, we need a performance indicator that is reliable and that can be applied on many PV systems at a very low cost. The existing approaches for analyzing the performance of PV systems are often based on the Performance Ratio (PR), whose accuracy depends on good solar irradiation data, which in turn can be very difficult to obtain or cost-prohibitive for the BIPV owner. We present an alternative fault detection procedure based on a performance indicator that can be constructed on the sole basis of the energy production data measured at the BIPV systems. This procedure does not require the input of operating conditions data, such as solar irradiation, air temperature, or wind speed. The performance indicator, called Performance to Peers (P2P), is constructed from spatial and temporal correlations between the energy output of neighboring and similar PV systems. This method was developed from the analysis of the energy production data of approximately 10,000 BIPV systems located in Europe. The results of our procedure are illustrated on the hourly, daily and monthly data monitored during one year at one BIPV system located in the South of Belgium. Our results confirm that it is possible to carry out automatic fault detection procedures without solar irradiation data. P2P proves to be more stable than PR most of the time, and thus constitutes a more reliable performance indicator for fault detection procedures. We also discuss the main limitations of this novel methodology, and we suggest several future lines of research that seem promising to improve on these procedures.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2962956816"}}

The paper presents the refurbishment of a residential building located in Chiasso (Switzerland) fully covered by photovoltaic modules. The eight storey apartment house was built in 1965 and after 45 years it was decided, due to its bad condition, to refurbish it. The building owner has set itself the target to totally renovate the building and to achieve the passive house standard. At the beginning of the construction phase, the builders put the goals even higher, deciding that by the use of BIPV modules to the entire facades they can achieve the Plus energy house standard (netZero Energy building). The renovation ended in November 2013. Beside the BIPV facades, a single-axis tracking photovoltaic plant was also installed on the pergola roof terrace in October of 2013 as a last resort.  This paper describes the building before and after renovation and discusses the critical points in the planning phase and during construction. Moreover, in order to assess the mechanical stability of the glass-glass a-Si module assembly on the facade, mechanical stress tests were performed in the SUPSI laboratories, which are explained in detail in this paper together with an accurate raytracing analysis (based on RADIANCE tool simulation) done to optimize the BIPV module strings and consequently to increase the energy production on an annual basis.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1207316544"}}

Today, the concept of net zero-energy buildings has become a major concern regarding fossil fuels combustion side effects, such as air pollution or global warming. Nonetheless, NG (natural gas) is a kind of fossil fuels which is widely combusted in Iran to meet various buildings heating demand. However, the objective of this study is mitigating NG flaring by substituting solar energy as an auxiliary energy source in dwelling buildings. To promote this idea a solar thermal collector is designed. This application is installed on the roof and is responsible to preheat either water circulates in radiators loop, to provide space heating, or domestic hot water to supply washing demand in residential apartments. Indeed, in case of utilizing this application fewer NG will be combusted for rising input water temperature to required value. This approach, consequently leads to decline CO2 emission eventually. Also a dwelling complex including 136 flat apartments is taken into account to perform this research. This complex is situated in Mashhad, the second megacity in Iran. Besides, to evaluate this potential four steps have been taking into account. In the first step annual DHW (domestic hot water) load is computed.

This paper presents the refurbishment of a tall building situated in Chiasso (Switzerland). The building envelope is completely covered by photovoltaic modules. The eight-storey apartment house was built in 1965 and was in poor condition after 45 years, when it was decided that refurbishment would be advisable. The target set by the owner was to renovate the building totally and to achieve the passive house standard. At the beginning of the construction phase the builders raised the goal even higher, and decided that the application of BIPV modules to the entire facades could achieve the Plus energy house standard (netZero Energy building).  In addition to the BIPV facades, a single-axis tracking photovoltaic system was also installed on the pergola roof terrace in October of 2013, as a final option. Solar thermal collectors (vacuum tubes) are also used to reduce the heating demand and to increase the COP of the heat Pump.

BIPV systems are small PV generation units spread out over the territory, and whose characteristics are very diverse. This makes difficult a cost-effective procedure for monitoring, fault detection, performance analyses, operation and maintenance. As a result, many problems affecting BIPV systems go undetected. In order to carry out effective automatic fault detection procedures, we need a performance indicator that is reliable and that can be applied on many PV systems at a very low cost. The existing approaches for analyzing the performance of PV systems are often based on the Performance Ratio (PR), whose accuracy depends on good solar irradiation data, which in turn can be very difficult to obtain or cost-prohibitive for the BIPV owner. We present an alternative fault detection procedure based on a performance indicator that can be constructed on the sole basis of the energy production data measured at the BIPV systems. This procedure does not require the input of operating conditions data, such as solar irradiation, air temperature, or wind speed. The performance indicator, called Performance to Peers (P2P), is constructed from spatial and temporal correlations between the energy output of neighboring and similar PV systems. This method was developed from the analysis of the energy production data of approximately 10,000 BIPV systems located in Europe. The results of our procedure are illustrated on the hourly, daily and monthly data monitored during one year at one BIPV system located in the South of Belgium. Our results confirm that it is possible to carry out automatic fault detection procedures without solar irradiation data.

Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in raising living standards and reducing poverty, particularly in previously lagging regions. Rapid solar home system (SHS) expansion in Bangladesh to some 3 million rural households by early 2014 has drawn the attention of donors and governments of other countries. The book\u0092s broad aim is twofold: (a) to assess the welfare impact of SHS on households, and (b) to evaluate the present institutional structure and financing mechanisms in place, noting that households want cheaper systems and good quality service while suppliers require a reasonable market-based profit to stay in business. The study entailed an intensive empirical investigation based on both primary and secondary data. The primary data consisted mainly of a large-scale, nationally representative household survey with appropriate geographic spread. Conducted in 2012 by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) and assisted by the World Bank, the household survey was designed to examine SHS benefits and costs. The book addresses a number of research issues, which are grouped according to general and gendered household impact, program delivery and monitoring of technical standards, market size and demand, and carbon emissions reduction. The book also analyzes household uses of solar-electric energy services. Typically, SHS models are used for lighting, powering fans and television sets, and charging mobile devices and other electrical equipment. Finally, the book evaluates the gender-disaggregated benefits and women's empowerment from SHS adoption. The gender analysis included two major research questions: (a) can the socioeconomic status of rural women be enhanced by increasing the opportunity to participate in alternative energy-service delivery, and (b) if SHS brings positive impacts in terms of social indicators, what additional efforts can supplement them to bring about a radical shift in gender roles and responsibilities. The book's findings show that better household lighting improves household welfare both directly and indirectly. The book has eight chapters. Chapter one is introduction. Chapter two describes the current status of Bangladesh's SHS expansion program, including salient features of system operation, as well as program delivery and financing. Chapter three reviews the role of electrification in rural development and international experience in using SHS as a complementary solution in remote off-grid areas. Based on the survey data findings, chapter four identifies the major drivers of SHS adoption and system capacity selection at the household and village level, while chapter five discusses and estimates the welfare benefits. Chapter six focuses on SHS market analysis and role of the subsidy, including consumers' willingness to pay and the potential impact of subsidy phase-out.

Malaysia and Southeast Asia in general, is a very suitable region for implementing solar technologies because Malaysia is located near the equatorial line, where sunlight remains strong and stable throughout the year. The average solar radiation per month is 400\u2013600MJ/m, so Malaysia should fully utilise solar energy because it is clean and sustainable. Solar energy can be considered as renewable energy that is environmentally friendly and can be continually replenished from time to time. The use of renewable energy is expected to increase exponentially in the future because natural resources could become depleted due to the increasing usage due to growing population in a world hungry for energy consumption for domestic, industrial and leisure purposes. Solar energy can provide infinite amount of energy because the sun can last for another few billions of years from now. So, many advanced nations have developed solar technologies to be implemented in a variety of sectors that include power generation and domestic water heating. The geographical location of Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries has enabled this region to be different from Western European countries that could only utilise solar energy through technology. Malaysia is located near the equatorial line, and so the sunlight in Malaysia remains strong and stable throughout the year. The average solar radiation per month for Malaysia is 400\u2013600MJ/m, and hence the country has a very high prospect to develop large-scale solar power plants. For now, Malaysian government is putting a lot of effort to promote solar energy use in Malaysia. The initial implementation of solar energy in Malaysia is for domestic solar water heaters. Unfortunately, the use of solar water heaters domestically and commercially is still low. According to estimate, around 45,000 buildings in Malaysia are appropriate for solar thermal usage, but 10% of them are not suitable because of roof shadings and structure. Different economic sectors in Malaysia can provide 110,000,000m of building surfaces for solar thermal applications and so about 75GW of power can be produced from this application. The photovoltaic (PV) technology was first built in Malaysia during 1980s in order to provide electricity to rural areas. Tenaga Nasional Bierhad, the national utility company, began to set up grid-connected PV systems as an alternative for national power utility and power production in 1998. One PV system was built at a British Petroleum petrol station along KESAS highway with 8 kWp capacity and another one built at the Solar Energy Research Institute at National University of Malaysia with 5.5 kWp capacity. In 2000, the first Malaysian Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) system was built in Port Dickson with 3.15 kWp capacity. Malaysia\u2019s universities are focusing on five majors of R&D for solar technologies, including inverters, PV concentrators, cells fabrications, hybrid systems and energy conversion tracking systems. The funding for the research in PV technologies is provided by Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI). Malaysian government also provides tax incentives so that a portion of the total cost of installing PV system can be deducted. The Feed-InTariffs can be the most promising policy because the utility pays a prestige price for the grid-connected PV electricity generated by system proprietors, and there is a 20-year of guarantee for the price. In short, Malaysia has a huge prospect to implement large-scale solar thermal systems. A solar collector is a type of heat exchanger that converts solar radiant energy into heat energy. Flat plate collector (FPC) is a type of solar thermal collectors. It will require minimal maintenance and is mechanically simple and with low installation cost. Major applications of solar energy like solar water heating, industrial process heating and air conditioning are using FPCs. Thermal performance for FPCs is treated in concise details, and the equations for collector performance can be reduced to simpler forms for performance analysis. Evacuated tube collectors (ETCs) contain heat pipe inside a vacuum-sealed tube. The", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2160488082"}}

Traditional air conditioning and heating systems in buildings are fossil fuel based energy systems, which take the main responsible for the carbon emissions. In contrast, using solar energy for air conditioning becomes one of the promising approaches to reduce energy consumptions and negative environmental impacts from buildings. University of California, Merced built a test facility to investigate the technology: solar cooling. The solar system has 54 m2 external compound parabolic concentrator (XCPC) solar collectors to drive a 23 kW double-effect absorption chiller. This paper first provides the detailed energy performance analysis of the experiments conducted in August, 2012. The data collected from the experiments shows that the system could provide adequate cooling for a test facility between 11AM to 5PM in both sunny and cloudy days. The daily average collector efficiency is at the range of 36% to 39%. The average coefficient of performance (COP) of the LiBr absorption chiller is between 0.91 and 1.02 with an average of 1.0, and the daily solar COP is approximately at 0.374. In addition to the experimental investigation, a detailed life cycle economic and environmental assessment was also performed by comparing the solar systems to the conventional systems in two types of office buildings at three locations at California. Two different solar cooling system configurations were considered: (i) configuration 1 sizes the area of solar collectors and absorption chiller to meet the peak cooling demand, and uses natural gas as the only backup energy source; (ii) configuration 2 sizes the area of solar collectors and absorption chiller to meet half of the peak cooling demand, and uses natural gas as the backup energy source for the absorption chiller, while incorporates an electrical vapor compression chiller to meet the rest half of peak cooling demand. The annual performance predicts that the systems can achieve the annual solar fraction around 55\u201368%. And the configuration 2 achieves better life cycle economic and environmental performance than the configuration 1.

As a drawback, the operating temperature of BIPV systems are usually higher compared to free standing PV systems because of limited cooling (1,2). Maintaining or reducing the operating temperature of PV elements is important during the photovoltaic energy conversion process since it influences the efficiency, the decline in performance over time and the lifetime of the PV system. In this paper, we present and analyze experimental results of the monitoring of ten BIPV systems realized within the \u201cPerformance BIPV\u201d project (partners CSTB, CEA, CNRS, Transenergie and Cythelia) and by EURAC in three European locations. The aim of our study is to investigate and compare the operative temperature issue in different BIPV applications. Each BIPV system is instrumented to record component temperatures (at the backside of PV modules), electrical production and environmental conditions. The monitored BIPV systems dataset is compared with two ground mounted PV plants located in Bolzano, which are monitored by EURAC since 2010 (3\u20135). The variation of PV module temperatures rise above ambient temperature is studied as a function of the global irradiation. Based on measured data, an empirical equivalent thermal resistance between PV modules and ambient temperature is considered for various time scales based on a static model. An overview on empirical equivalent thermal resistance values for each analyzed system is provided, resulting in a range from 0.0297 to 0.0397 for most of the BIPV systems and from 0.0249 to 0.0291 for the not-integrated PV systems. As further studies, collaborative projects will be launched between some partners in order to propose solutions to improve the thermal operating conditions of BIPV systems.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3100831578"}}

More importantly, we have taken optical parameters of the cells in different sun wavelength spectra on the front and back side of the cell because optical response at each wavelength affects differently on the energy conversion efficiency of the cell and thermal properties of BIPV windows. By using three different semi-transparent solar cell types, the annual whole building energy simulation was performed to evaluate the BIPV window performance in six different climate conditions. A significant change in the overall building energy consumption was observed by varying the thermo-optical characteristics of BIPV windows.

Solar energy is free, environmentally clean, and therefore it is accepted as one of the most promising alternative energy sources. The effective use of solar energy is hindered by the intermittent nature of its availability, limiting its use and effectiveness in domestic and industrial applications especially in water heating. Conversion of solar energy into thermal energy is the easiest and most used method. The efficiency of solar thermal conversion is around 70% but solar electrical direct conversion system has an efficiency of only 17%. Solar water heating systems are mostly suited for its ease of operation and simple maintenance. Many research papers revealed that the improvement on thermal efficiency of solar water heating systems resulted in techniques to improve the convection heat transfer. Solar water heating systems are classified into two broad categories as passive and active systems. Passive techniques have been used to improve the convective heat transfer. The techniques like insertion of twisted tapes and its geometry, etc., play a vital role to improve the performance of solar water heating systems. This review paper summarizes the previous works on solar water heating systems with various heat transfer enhancement techniques include collector design, collector tilt angle, coating of pipes, fluid flow rate, thermal insulation, integrated collector storage, thermal energy storage, use of phase change materials, and insertion of twisted tapes.

This surplus will rise strongly with the share of fluctuating renewable energies on the net electricity consumption.

Transparent organic solar cells have recently attracted extensive interest considering their potential application for the power-generating window. By allowing the transmission of visible light while converting ultraviolet and near infrared light in the solar spectrum into electricity, transparent solar cells integrated into building facade provide a smart solution to the energy dilemma in urban area. However, current works mainly optimize the performance of solar cells for very limited incident condition, such as only considering normal incidence, which results in impractical designs for real applications. In this paper, we propose a robust design approach to achieve high-performance transparent solar cell based on a non-periodic photonic structure considering a broad range of incident conditions representing natural sunlight illumination. Statistical performances are used in the robust design formulation and efficient sampling techniques are further employed to improve the computational efficiency. The Pareto-optimal solutions are obtained according to the multicriteria preference with respect to maximizing the expected cell transparency and the expected energy conversion efficiency, and minimizing the performance variance due to the incidence variation. As one example of the optimized design, the absorbing efficiency of the solar cell could be up to 85% that of its opaque counterpart with 32% visible light transmission and 0.13% variation coefficient of transparency under the actual solar illumination and incident angles from 9am to 3pm.

The presence of an air gap between a photovoltaic (PV) module and roof facilitates ventilation cooling under the device and consequently reduces cell temperature and improves its performance. In case of rack-mounted PV installation, the Nominal Operating Cell Temperature (NOCT) method could be effectively used to predict the temperature of the module for various environmental conditions. Many countries, for esthetic purposes, offer economic advantages (tax deductions, incentives, etc\u2026) for the installation of building integrated photovoltaic modules (BIPV), with water-tightness capability and adequate mechanical resistance in order to substitute tile covering or part of it. Nevertheless, poor or absent ventilation under BIPV panels could cause them to overheat and reduce their efficiency. Lack of validated predictive tools for the evaluation of BIVP energy performance could be another barrier to their widespread application. In this study, we investigated the thermal performance of PV modules installed in a real scale experimental building over a traditional clay tile pitched roof in Italy for almost one year (from August 2009 to June 2010). One PV module was rack-mounted over the roof covering with a 0.2 m air gap; the others were fully integrated and installed at the same level of the roof covering (one with an air gap of 0.04 m, the other mounted directly in contact with the insulation). Temperature and heat flux measurements for each panel, and environmental parameters were recorded. Two temperature prediction models, NOCT model and SNL (Sandia National Laboratory) model were used to predict BIPV temperature and energy efficiency so that their suitability for BIPV could be evaluated. SNL model takes into account also the wind speed. Experimental results demonstrate that even though the rack-mounted PV module constantly maintains cell temperature below that of the other full-building integrated modules, due to the presence of a higher air gap, the difference in the energy produced by the BIPV modules estimated for the entire monitoring period is less than 4%. The two predictive models, NOCT and SNL, cause the differences in predicted and calculated temperature up to 10 \u00b0C. However, subsequent percentage variations on the energy predicted compared to that arising from the temperature measured generally turn out to be lower than 5%. An optimization of empirical coefficients used for calculations based on the SNL method allows for the reduction of this value below 2.5%.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2089641630"}}

In the previous studies, the solar absorption air-conditioning using the working pair of water \u2013 lithium bromide (H2O\u2013LiBr) is found to have prominent primary energy saving than the conventional compression air-conditioning for buildings in the hot-humid climate. In this study, three integration strategies have been generated for solar cooling, namely integrated absorption air-conditioning; integrated absorption-desiccant air-conditioning; and integrated absorption-desiccant air-conditioning for radiant cooling. To realize these ideas, the working pair of ammonia \u2013 water (NH3\u2013H2O) was used in the absorption cycle, rather than H2O\u2013LiBr. As such, the evaporator and the condenser can be separate from the absorption refrigeration cycle for the new configuration of various integrated design alternatives. Through dynamic simulation, the year-round primary energy saving of the proposed integration strategies for solar NH3\u2013H2O absorption air-conditioning systems could be up to 50.6% and 25.5%, as compared to the conventional compression air-conditioning and the basic solar H2O\u2013LiBr absorption air-conditioning respectively.

In the countries of the European Union the building sector accounts for about 40% of the total energy consumption, so it is necessary that the buildings should be designed in a functional and environmentally-friendly way, in addition to the minimization of of the total energy needs to achieve energy savings. As for the existing buildings, they should be renovated so that maximum energy savings is achieved. On the other hand, the EU\u2019s target for 2020 is that new buildings must be of zero carbon dioxide emissions. For the implementation of this goal, buildings should be designed according to the principles of bioclimatic architecture to minimize energy needs, but also systems of Renewable Energy Sources should be applied to produce thermal energy and electricity, in order to minimize carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. \tIn the present thesis, strategies aiming to harmonic integration of buildings in the natural environment are developed, holistic energy saving aspects for buildings are presented, aspects regarding the next step to the target for 2020 are given, and some new designs of building integrated RES, investigated at the Solar Energy Laboratory, are suggested.

Renewable energy resource is considered by many developed and developing countries as a promising and a cost effective candidate to provide energy.

So, more economically and environmentally friendly HVAC systems are desired to provide the required electricity demands for cooling loads while saving energy and having low emissions to the environment. In this paper, a parabolic trough solar collector is integrated with a triple effect absorption cooling system for sustainable development. A computer code is developed using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software to obtain all required thermodynamic properties of water-lithium bromide (H2O/LiBr) solution and to optimize all operating parameters and carry out all detailed energy and exergy analyses for a 10 kW cooling capacity. In addition, the parabolic trough solar collector (PTSC) is also designed for the required cooling load and its overall dynamic behavior is also investigated.

Energetic and exergetic efficiencies of the PTSC for every month are also evaluated under different operating conditions.

The collector efficiency factor is directly affecting the efficiency of the solar flat-plate collector, this collector efficiency factor influenced with few other parameters, i.e. the center to center distance of absorber tubes W and thickness of absorber plate \u03b4 and heat loss coefficient U L . This paper focuses on the relation between \u03b4 with the collector efficiency factor of serpentine tube solar flat-plate collector.

The initial goal of the MUNI Ways and Structures Building Integrated Solar Membrane Installation Project was for the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) to gain experience using the integrated higher efficiency solar photovoltaic (PV) single-ply membrane product, as it differs from the conventional, low efficiency, thin-film PV products, to determine the feasibility of success of larger deployment. As several of CCSF\u2019s municipal rooftops are constrained with respect to weight restrictions, staff of the Energy Generation Group of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) proposed to install a solar PV system using single-ply membrane The installation of the 100 kW (DC-STC) lightweight photo voltaic (PV) system at the MUNI Ways and Structures Center (700 Pennsylvania Ave., San Francisco) is a continuation of the commitment of the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) to increase the pace of municipal solar development, and serve its municipal facilities with clean renewable energy. The fourteen (14) solar photovoltaic systems that have already been installed at CCSF municipal facilities are assisting in the reduction of fossil-fuel use, and reduction of greenhouse gases from fossil combustion. The MUNI Ways & Structures Center roof has a relatively low weight-bearing capacity (3.25 pounds per square foot) and use of traditional crystalline panels was therefore rejected. Consequently it was decided to use the best available highest efficiency Building-Integrated PV (BIPV) technology, with consideration for reliability and experience of the manufacturer which can meet the low weight-bearing capacity criteria. The original goal of the project was to provide an opportunity to monitor the results of the BIPV technology and compare these results to other City and County of San Francisco installed PV systems. The MUNI Ways and Structures Center was acquired from the Cookson Doors Company, which had run the Center for many decades. The building was renovated in 1998, but the existing roof had not been designed to carry a large load. Due to this fact, a complete roofing and structural analysis had to be performed to match the available roof loading to the existing and/or new solar PV technology, and BIPV was considered an excellent solution for this structure with the roof weight limitations. The solar BIPV system on the large roof area was estimated to provide about 25% of the total facility load with an average of 52,560 kWh per month. In order to accomplish the goals of the project, the following steps were performed: 1. SFPUC and consultants evaluated the structural capability of the facility roof, with recommendations for improvements necessary to accommodate the solar PV system and determine the suitable size of the system in kilowatts. The electrical room and switchgear were evaluated for any improvements necessary and to identify any constraints that might impede the installation of necessary inverters, transformers or meters. 2. Development of a design-build Request for Proposal (RFP) to identify the specifications for the solar PV system, and to include SFPUC technical specifications, equipment warranties and performance warranties. Due to potential labor issues in the local solar industry, SFPUC adjusted the terms of the RFP to more clearly define scope of work between electricians, roofers and laborers. 3. Design phase of project included electrical design drawings, calculations and other construction documents to support three submittals: 50% (preliminary design), 90% (detailed design) and 100% (Department of Building Inspection permit approved). 4. Installation of solar photovoltaic panels, completion of conduit and wiring work, connection of inverters, isolation switches, meters and Data Acquisition System by Contractor (Department of Public Works). 5. Commissioning of system, including all necessary tests to make the PV system fully functional and operational at its rated capacity of 100 kW (DC-STC). Following completion of these steps, the solar PV system was installed and fully integrated by late October 2013. The interconnection with PG&E utility grid was completed and the system began generating power on November 21, 2013. The projected annual energy generation for the system is estimated at 127,120 kWh/year.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2296757888"}}

Abstract The increasing spread of photovoltaic (PV) systems occurring nowadays does not always keep pace with respective legislative initiatives, especially those regarding a specific relation between PV systems, the natural environment and landscape. As a result of this differentiation, the existence of legislative gaps or omissions is noticed. Thus, while the development of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is actively promoted by the government in general, from a legal point of view there are no equivalent preventive measures for the protection and preservation of physical environment and landscape aesthetics, at least in all types of RES, with the exception of wind farms. In fact, in the case of PV systems, there is no specific legal framework, which would regulate their integration in the environment, and in particular into landscape. The work analyzes a method for assessment of aesthetic impact caused by PV plants. The method is developed in MATLAB and based on the use of a PV plant photo and the quantification of three parameters: visibility, color and fractality. Purpose of this work is to propose this method as an applicable integration rule of PV systems into landscape, aiming to reduce its aesthetic downgrading, contributing thereby to sustainability. Additionally, in an interdisciplinary approach, the suggested method restores the issue of the explicit legislative provision of specific rules and criteria regarding the PV systems integration into landscape.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1999217510"}}

The second phase is a shape research in terms of Surface Area Potential and a comparison between 3d shapes using parametric tools. Thereby the ability of different shapes with various folding or curvature patterns to increase their surface for predefined total dimensions is evaluated. The results lead to structures which can provide much more active PV area for a given facade area. The third phase is a solar analysis of 56 of the three dimensional shapes tested and compared in phase 2. Thereby the real average solar radiation reaching the surface of various prismatic or corrugated 3d patterns is calculated and graphically presented. Incident Solar Energy values and partial shading percentages within every shape clearly illustrate which 3d shapes have the highest potential for making maximum use of solar radiation. The relation between surface area increase through denser folding or curving patterns and total received solar energy constitutes the most important finding of this phase. In a fourth phase Laboratory tests are performed at the PV-LAB of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering TUDelft. Different 3d shape versions are tested using flexible Thin Film solar panels. The fact that solar cells performance (output) does not decrease linearly proportional to partial shading and total incident solar energy changes makes real Lab Tests an import- ant verification of the solar analysis results. Finally the best performing shapes are used as the basis to create design proposals in the form of a light control/shading device. The PV optimized 3d surface is thereby developed as a facade structure with possible ways of operation and integration into the NEXT FACADE Concept by Alcoa Architectuursystemen. Additionally ways of using the produced energy and creating a complete efficient PV based system are proposed.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W69706555"}}

The Desert Research Institute (DRI) has developed a Renewable Energy Deployment and Display Facility (REDD) which utilizes solar and wind to create a net zero energy residence for research, education, and outreach. The facility is a demonstration of the integration of many renewable energy technologies into a residential setting such that technology developers can show proof-of-concept, students and trade workers can get hands-on experience, and public organizations can see renewable energy components implemented into a residential setting. A major technological aspect of the facility is the use of solar thermal energy to provide space heating, Domestic Hot Water (DHW), and solar cooling. Data are monitored from three separate solar thermal systems, each with their own hot water storage, to evaluate optimized utilization of solar thermal energy into residential applications. The three solar thermal systems differ in their working fluids. System 1 uses a conventional mixture of glycol and water in 200 ft2 of ground mounted collector area, System 2 uses DHW in 210 ft2 of roof mounted collector area, and System 3 uses air in a 578 ft2 collector built into the roof. Each system is configured to be used for space heating and DHW. Systems 1 and 2 are built into the HVAC system of the 1200 ft2 house, and System 3 is built into the HVAC system of the 600 ft2 detached workshop. Data collected from each system provide the basis for year-long energy and economic simulations using TRNSYS for comparison. The results from the simulations are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of site-built solar air collectors, which have the advantage of using conventional materials, and avoid the issues of liquid collectors associated with boiling and freezing. This paper describes the experimental setup of the solar thermal systems, how the data are used as inputs to the computer simulations, and the configuration of the computer simulations.

Solar photovoltaic modules are integrated into ancient roofs, and small scale wind turbines are taking up the ancient urban spaces.

The production of solar energy in cities is clearly a way to diminish our dependency to fossil fuels, and is a good way to mitigate global warming by lowering the emission of greenhouse gases. However, what are the impacts of solar panels locally ? To evaluate their influence on urban weather, it is necessary to parameterize their effects within the surface schemes that are coupled to atmospheric models. The present paper presents a way to implement solar panels in the Town Energy Balance scheme, taking account of the energy production (for thermal and photovoltaic panels), the impact on the building below and feedback towards the urban micro-climate through radiative and convective fluxes. A scenario of large but realistic deployment of solar panels on the Paris metropolitan area is then simulated. It is shown that solar panels, by shading the roofs, slightly increases the need for domestic heating (3%). In summer however, the solar panels reduce the energy needed for air-conditioning (by 12%) and also the Urban Heat Island (UHI): 0.2K by day and up to 0.3K at night. These impacts are larger than those found in previous works, because of the use of thermal panels (that are more efficient than photovoltaic panels) and the geographical position of Paris, which is relatively far from the sea. This means that it is not influenced by sea breezes, and hence that its UHI is stronger than for a coastal city of the same size. But this also means that local adaptation strategies aiming to decrease the UHI will have more potent effects. In summary, the deployment of solar panels is good both globally, to produce renewable energy (and hence to limit the warming of the climate) and locally, to decrease the UHI, especially in summer, when it can constitute a health threat.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2026804118"}}

This solar cooling system is comprised of 53.3 m2 of XCPC trough collectors which are used to power a 23 kW double effect (LiBr) absorption chiller. This is the first system that combines both XCPC and absorption chilling technologies. Performance of the system was measured in both sunny and cloudy conditions, with both clean and dirty collectors. It took, on average, about 2 h for the collector system to reach operating temperatures between 160 and 180 \u00b0C. When operated in this temperature range, the XCPC collector array collected solar energy with an average daily efficiency of 36.7% and reached instantaneous efficiencies up to 40%.

This paper aims to investigate about the design of outdoor finish materials reflecting a thin film gathering solar energy to apply urban aesthetics and environment-friendly design. A thin film of solar energy can be highly utilized for architectural design owing to its attribute of materiality that can be flexible and easily bended for a straight and curved line of architecture. Accordingly, it can be freely applied for landscape design regardless of construction and reconstruction. This panel can be an innovative material for creative architectural design in this era when the environmental issue is getting more significant.

To further understand and quantify the impact of different types of shadings on the power output performance, the I-V curves of a PV module were tested under different solar radiation. The testing results showed that the impact of different types of shadings on the power performance varied with the Sun position, solar radiation as well as the time.

New lighting devices (LED) can reduce the electricity consumption substantially. Two alternatives are envisioned in this paper: A stand-alone alternative in which there is no grid connection, that would require local storage (battery), and a grid-connection alternative.  After reviewing and investigating relevant literature for this topic and writing theoretical part of thesis there were the fallowing tasks. One typical four member family household was described and hourly load curves for one year period, with typical summer and winter days, were made for this case. Next task that was completed was generating yearly energy production from solar panels, which the observed household contains, in INSEL software. With having those previously mentioned data, combined with necessary information about prices of all necessary components and prices from Croatian power system, it was possible to make feasibility and cost analysis where the two previously mentioned alternatives were investigated. With changing some parameters in that economical analysis several scenarios were observed.

Let me be clear that I am a proponent of solar energy. I built a mountain cabin a few years ago that is entirely off the grid. All of the electricity comes from solar photovoltaic (PV) panels with battery storage. The 24 volt DC is converted to AC with an inverter and is fed into a conventional electrical panel. It provides enough energy to power the lights, run a 240 volt, three-quarter horsepower water pump 320 feet deep in the well, and electrical appliances such as a coffee pot, toaster, and vacuum cleaner.

Solar is not adequate to power these appliances. In 2010 I also had a 2.5 kW solar PV system installed on my house that ties into the utility grid.

An essential step in reducing the overall cost of PV systems is a systematic approach to labor costs reduction, supported by an understanding and quantification of the activities that make up the installation process. Historically, time and motion studies have occurred on standardized factory floors, but these have been extended to the construction industry. Now this method is extended to solar PV systems, addressing barriers, such as nonstandardized hardware, ad-hoc nomenclature, ad-hoc processes, and varying contextual parameters. The proposed methodology takes a three-pronged approach to addressing these barriers, including initiating a formalized domain specific language (DSL), utilizing a flexible site log, and creating a robust data repository. The preliminary data from multiple residential sloped-roof and commercial flat-roof sites provide comprehensive testing and validation of the proposed methodology.

Glazed flat plate solar collectors offer a simple and cost effective approach to heating water. However, on clear nights solar collectors can transfer a significant amount of heat to the atmosphere by radiation. In areas with a cool climate and high relative humidity the radiation heat loss can lead to the temperature of the glazing often reaching the dew-point of the surrounding air, this leads to condensation developing on the glazing. If water condenses on the inside of the glazing and repeatedly drips onto the solar absorber this could lead to damage of the solar collector surface thus shortening its operating life.

The growing population has added a burden to the existing power generation station. So what if the demand by the people exceeds the generation capability. The consequence is power deficiency. The world has to remain in dark weighing down the economy of the country. The alternative solution for this is generation mix. Now a day's commercial building is increasing at a greater pace. So in addition to generation mix we are thinking of making it economic. Economic is in the sense of reducing the grid dependency of a commercial building. Through this the cost incurred by a commercial building can be minimized to a greater extent, which can be utilized for some additional utilities. Generation mix includes the ultimate energy coming from sun, wind, tidal, geo-thermal, bio-gas, bio-mass.

In recent years, interest in building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) has increased considerably. This thesis aims to evaluate the energy performance of semi-transparent photovoltaic facade for office buildings in central China and to propose optimal design based on the evaluation.  In this study, an experimental room was set up in Wuhan, which is typical city of central China in climate. Then, the calculation models for energy evaluation of PV facades are developed and validated based on field experiments. The architectural models were developed with a series of generic office rooms. Finally, the architectural models and validated models were incorporated into the simulations with Energy Plus for energy evaluation of semi-transparent PV facade. Energy evaluations based on the PV generated electricity were performed in four cities of China. The results show that with the varieties of cities and building orientations, building forms, and materials and arrangements of PV modules, there was a distinct difference in annual power generation of PV facades. Energy evaluations based on the overall energy consumption were performed for two types of the PV facades in Wuhan. The impacts of the properties of PV glazing and the architecture factors on the overall energy of semi-transparent PV facades was addressed. For example, in large window-to-wall ratio (WWR) office rooms, mono-crystalline semi-transparent PV of high PV coverage ratio (PVR) could be energy efficient. Therefore, use of optimal PVR and WWR based on the combination of room depth and orientation can achieve overall energy consumption saving. In addition, the suitability of optimal PVR/WWR strategies for PV facades in different architectural conditions was investigated with the consideration of Chinese Design Standard for Energy Efficiency of Public Buildings. The mono-crystalline semi-transparent PV could only achieve a better overall energy performance in the cases of small WWR and small depth room meanwhile amorphous-silicon fail to achieve a better overall energy performance in all cases.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1545906778"}}

Abstract The recent growth of renewable sources has led to relevant effects in terms of land consuming, social acceptance, distributed energy generation, non continuous production caused by non-programmable sources such as wind and solar one also characterized by low energy density per surface unit. These issues will be addressed in the next future through the concept of energy smart grid, provided by ICT (Information and Communication Technology). The aims of this paper is to show the preliminary results of the research activities carried out by several operative unities of the Universities of Perugia and Cusano, within a national research project, where one possible solution for renewable energy integration to solve the criticisms in renewable sources application is proposed modeled. The model prototype for energy production could be good applied in existing ancient building with vertical extension such as the dove towers typical of rural areas in central Italy. The preliminary design of the prototype is applied to a chosen case study in Perugia: it consists in an integrated system in which the tower is converted to an energy system for renewable energy production, storage and supply, based on photovoltaic, hydropower and geothermal heat pump with boreholes integrated to micropiles. Energy managing is leaded by an intelligent system, by combining meteorological forecasting to predict energy productions by renewables with the energy demand needs. In particular, the concept of this project is mainly effective because in the rural areas there are many little building centers that are abandoned because they are without any connection to the electricity grid and methane piping: the possibility to create an autonomous energy system is the basis for energy supply.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3021547363"}}

One of the carbon reduction strategies is using solar energy (power). Solar energy is the most popular renewable energy and an essential technology for powering our cities in the future.

Solar energy has been used by humans for thousands of years. They used orienting building toward the south for more light and heat. Now, using and storing maximum sunlight and heat is a significant design criterion for cities and streets. Solar energy is the technology used to harness the sun\u2019s energy and make it useable. Today, the technology produces less than one tenth of one percent of global energy demand. The objective of this paper is to explain the importance of using, firstly, passive solar energy design criteria in cities and to give cases where solar energy is used for a sustainable lifestyle (e.g. Masdar City, Dongtan, King Abdullah Financial District, Crystal Island, ZED Factory Projects and Zira Island). As a result, the design of cities, streets and buildings will change. For example, the roofs will be very important for storm-water. Some buildings have green roofs.

NASA's Johnson Space Center has implemented a great number of renewable energy systems. Renewable energy systems are necessary to research and implement if we humans are expected to continue to grow and thrive on this planet. These systems generate energy using renewable sources - water, wind, sun - things that we will not run out of. Johnson Space Center is helping to pave the way by installing and studying various renewable energy systems. The objective of this report will be to examine the completed renewable energy projects at NASA's Johnson Space Center for a time span of ten years, beginning in 2003 and ending in early 2014. This report will analyze the success of each project based on actual vs. projected savings and actual vs. projected efficiency. Additionally, both positive and negative experiences are documented so that lessons may be learned from past experiences. NASA is incorporating renewable energy wherever it can, including into buildings. According to the 2012 JSC Annual Sustainability Report, there are 321,660 square feet of green building space on JSC's campus. The two projects discussed here are major contributors to that statistic. These buildings were designed to meet various Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification criteria. LEED Certified buildings use 30 to 50 percent less energy and water compared to non-LEED buildings. The objectives of this project were to examine data from the renewable energy systems in two of the green buildings onsite - Building 12 and Building 20. In Building 12, data was examined from the solar photovoltaic arrays. In Building 20, data was examined from the solar water heater system. By examining the data from the two buildings, it could be determined if the renewable energy systems are operating efficiently. Objectives In Building 12, the data from the solar photovoltaic arrays shows that the system is continuously collecting energy from the sun, as shown by the graph below. Building 12 has two solar inverters, located on the second floor, that collected the data from the solar photovoltaic arrays. The data displayed here is the total energy produced by the system. These are cumulative amounts, so the last point on the graph shows all of the energy collected from the system since the start of its operation. The data shown here was manually collected from the solar inverters. However, the data is also automatically recorded through EBI. Through analysis of both sets of data it was determined that the EBI data was faulty. For example, from the manually collected data it can be determined that a total of 73 kWh of energy was collected between the dates of 1/16/2014 \u2013 1/22/2014. The EBI data reports that approximately 17800 kWh of energy was collected during the same time frame. Not only does this exceed the time frame examined, but it also exceeds the total energy collected from the start of collection as recorded from the inverters. This leads to the belief that there is a malfunction with the automatic recording of the energy. In Building 20, data was examined from the solar water heater dating back many months and found that the pump for the solar water heater system was not operating properly, as exhibited in the graph shown below. The pump operates on a solar energy system, meaning that it collects energy throughout the day from the sun. Because of this, the system would stop operating shortly after the sun set because of a lack of sunlight. At that point, the graph should show a zero flow rate, but as exhibited in the graph below, that is not the case. It is clearly shown that the pump is continuously operating, even during the night. It was also observed that the majority of the time the pump would not turn on at all, despite good weather conditions. This led to the conclusion that the pump is malfunctioning, and needs to be examined and fixed.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W26166876"}}

The Brazilian energy demand is growing fast, and it is necessary to invest in new energy generation plants. However, most sources of power generation commonly used in Brazil have significant environmental and social impacts.

The results indicate that with encouragement from the Government is financially viable the implementation of solar photovoltaic systems in social housing.

The present work deals with the application of building-integrated grid-connected photovoltaic systems, analyzing conceptual aspects and advantages and disadvantages of building-integrated PV systems (BIPV) and building-applied systems (BAPV). This study is motivated by the recent interest increase, in the world and more specifically in Brazil, in installations with characteristics of architectonic integration. Aiming to attach the theoretical concepts to the main functionality of PV systems, the electricity generation, this paper develops energy performance analysis for low-latitude regions, where predominantly vertical installations distance themselves more evidently from the optimum case. Brazil has 15 metropolis located at latitudes between 11\u00ba South and 3\u00ba North, including all of the Northern Region.

However, it is also observed that the availability of friendly BIPV materials in Brazil, and more specifically in the Northern Region, is limited, which helps to explain the greater occurrence, nowadays, of simpler installations, the BAPV ones, mainly due to the higher costs of BIPV installations.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4389126421"}}

We carried out this research with an on-line survey applied to architects of all Brazilian states and asked them their preferences about photovoltaic integration. We applied the survey to independent professionals, professors and researchers and observed that half of them knew about photovoltaic solar energy, but did not know about building integrated photovoltaics. Architects showed interest in many building integration aspects and demonstrated interest to know more about this technology. They were very concerned about performance generation and the best way modules can be exposed to the maximum solar irradiation levels possible. They also believe that the specific module position to receive maximum radiation is the only one way to use photovoltaics in buildings. When asked about architectonical composition aspects, architects prefer discreet integrations with few or no evidence of photovoltaic modules in a building. Brazilian architects are open to use photovoltaics in their projects, but they need to know more about the peculiarities of this technology, and specifically about solar radiation, so that they can be able to design building integrated photovoltaic systems aware of the technology needs and limitations, and understand the degrees of architectural freedom.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4389126447"}}

The Atacama Desert, located in northern Chile, is regarded as one of the regions with the highest solar radiation in the world. However, Chile exploits limited renewable energy resources, currently represented by hydroelectric generation, wood based biomass and incipient wind farms. Thus, the country relies heavily on fuel imports to meet its growing energy demand, making it a growing net importer of energy. Therefore, it is of critical importance for Chile to secure adequate energy supplies, ensuring that imported energy is accessible through international markets in order to satisfy any requirements that cannot be met by its internal production. Renewable energy is emerging as an interesting alternative to fossil fuels, and therefore it is important to evaluate the resource potential of wind, solar, geothermal and other energy sources. Herein, we present an evaluation of the potential for solar thermal energy applications in Chile, obtained through computer simulations using a solar radiation database obtained from the Chile-SR satellite estimation model. The results show that there is good potential for the application of solar technologies throughout the country, with solar fractions for both flat plate and evacuated tube solar thermal collectors being higher than 0.4. CSP plants can achieve up to 50% more electricity production than those in Spain. The high availability of solar radiation in Chile constitutes a good opportunity for the deployment of technologies which could help the country achieve a greater degree of energy independence.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4389126789"}}

The low-frequency ripple current caused by the single-phase inverter can be compensated promptly by introducing a current integrator instead of unit feedback in the control strategy of the ALFRCD. With this current integrator, the device is unable to output dc current, which is similar to the function of a capacitor.

Abstract : The objective was to study how well a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) roof, mainly consisting of photovoltaic (PV) laminates bonded to a polyvinyl-chloride (PVC) membrane, performed as PV and roofing systems. The project focused on studying three BIPV systems, but additional sites were surveyed for ancillary information and comparison. In-person roof surveys using the ROOFER Engineered Management Systems approach and laboratory testing based on ASTM D 4434 tests were used to evaluate roof longevity. Energy output and weather data were used to evaluate PV performance. Temperature and air conditioning system data was collected at one location. ROOFER identified a number issues with the PVC part of the roof, but was insufficient for unanticipated issues with the PV system, such as PV adhesive failures. The PV system performed as expected, but is highly susceptible to soiling in low-slope roof applications. The BIPV system was shown to produce an overall reduction in roof temperature, but the air conditioning saving analysis was inconclusive due to problems with the facility that was studied. A computer model was used to estimate what savings could have been achieved and additional models were used to estimate the savings in other U.S. climates. This BIPV system is no longer commercially available, but similar implementations still exist and will benefit from the lessons learned during the study.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1547585222"}}

The clamping profile has been a good choice to define prod- uct contours, close small production tolerances and protect users for sharp edges.

The elegant naturally curved contour clamping profile gives the product shape and differentiation from conventional block shaped cooling units. The eccentric fan is hidden behind a sheet of stretched metal, this choice enables the product to be symmetric from all sides. The chiller is suitable for placement below the included solar heat panels or for stand-alone applications.

A solar energy system would generally be more cost-effective if it were used to provide both heating and cooling requirements in the building it serves. The aim of this study is to investigate a solar single/double effect LiBr-H2O absorption chiller driven by Fresnel solar collector with thermal storage. The studied LiBr-H2O absorption chiller can be altered between the double effect and single effect modes automatically, depending on the driving temperature provided by the solar collectors. It is designed that the absorption chiller will operate in double effect mode when the hot water temperature is higher than 150\u00b0C, and will be run in single effect mode when the hot water temperature is lower than 135\u00b0C. In this way, the solar thermal energy can be used more efficiently for cooling, i.e. the average COP of the unit is higher than that of the single effect absorption unit and the time for producing cooling is longer than that of the double effect unit. Moreover, by using the specially developed Fresnel solar collector, the solar collection section can provide thermal energy at higher temperature level compared to the normal evacuated tube solar collectors. To offset the negative effect of solar intermittence because of the weather conditions, the changing of day and night, molten-salt storage unit is installed for supporting 2 hours operation of the absorption chiller.

This paper examines the life cycle environmental and economic performance of commercially available semi-transparent BIPV modules for window application under the tropical conditions of Singapore. Energy simulations, previously performed, were adopted to conduct a life cycle assessment to determine the long term performance in terms of energy and carbon emissions, as well as cost considerations. The EPBT and EROEI for the modules ranged from 0.68 to 1.98 and 11.72 to 34.49 respectively. After considering government subsidies, some modules cost lower than conventional windows, while half of the remaining modules, achieved payback periods of 1.1\u201313.1 years. These performance indicators were used to form a decision-making tool to assist architects and building designers in the selection of BIPV modules for windows during the early design stages.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2088827363"}}

This paper presents a study of energy performance enhancement methods in multistory residential buildings. The study is carried out for Montreal location, Canada (45\u00b0N). All configurations considered assume a suburban environment that allows high solar exposure and no obstruction from adjacent buildings or external surrounding objects such as trees. Energy performance is measured by the balance between energy consumption, on the demand side, and electricity production by means of integrated PV systems, on the supply side. The present study considers enhancement of the supply side by increasing electricity generation potential. Apartment buildings are designed to be highly energy efficient and to conform to passive solar design principles. The buildings investigated include \u2013 low rise (3\u20135 floors), mid-rise (6\u20139 floors) and high-rise (up to 12 floors), with eight apartments per floor. All Integration of PV systems in fa\u00e7ades, in addition to roof surfaces, is considered, in view of the reduced availability of roof surface per dwelling unit. The results of simulations employing the EnergyPlus building simulation program indicate that apartment buildings are relatively energy efficient for heating and cooling, while allowing a high level of residential density, but their solar potential is limited. Under the present study, a building of three stories can generate about 96% of its total energy use, if the roof design is optimized for solar energy generation. Above 3 floors, additional measures are required to enhance energy production. Implementing PV systems on 50% of south fa\u00e7ade and 80% of east and west fa\u00e7ades surface areas, in addition to enhanced roof surface design (folded-plate), enables electricity production of up to 90% of energy use of a 4-story building reducing with increasing height to 50% for 12 stories. The study indicates that investment in advanced design of fa\u00e7ades (such as folded-plate curtain walls) can substantially increase electricity production and achieve net zero and surplus energy status in building over eight stories high.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2022265854"}}

This integrated collector storage has a secondary circuit collecting the irradiation and transferring it at the bottom front face of the cavity.

Abstract -The shading pattern of a Solar Panel if analyzed helps to improve the performance of a Solar panel. Shades on top of a Solar Panel are one of the major factors which causes disturbance on a solar panel. This paper helps analyze the shading on a solar panel which is caused by steady clouds. This may help to increase the efficiency of a solar panel. Various methods of Image processing technique is used to get the desired output. Those methods include techniques like median filtering and various morphological functions like usage of structuring element which gives the desired output. The problem of Boundary Estimation of a shading patter on a solar panel is addressed. Short-time shading and lightning is not at all useful for solar power plant. If the solar panel is shaded then proper measures have to be taken to keep the efficiency intact else there would be a serious loss in the amount of current generated with the help of a solar panel. Here the pixel values are measured and thus the exact numbers of dark and bright pixels are calculated and even the pixel values are reconfigurated to get the correct boundary estimation. The bypass diode is used to bypass the shaded area on the panel, which in turn helps to increase the efficiency of a solar panel by a significant amount. This method takes care of processing all kinds of shade on the solar panel from whatever source the shade is generated from.This concept can be taken further to analyse the various other parameters for effective operation.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2129677716"}}

An ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) cushion structure integrated photovoltaic panels is proposed for solar energy utilization of cushion structures. It can maintain cushion operation by photovoltaic electricity and provide a way of collecting thermal energy due to enclosed cushions. An experimental mockup composed of a three-layer ETFE cushion and amorphous silicon photovoltaic panels (a-Si PV) has been developed and a series of experiments have been conducted in summer, especially under sunny and sunny to cloudy conditions. On the whole, the experimental results showed that this system operated smoothly and steadily. In this paper, two studies, i.e. one-day study and three-day study have been done to investigate system performance and feasibility. For energy, the average stored electricity was 61 W h and the average ratio of consumption electricity to output electricity under sunny condition was lower than that under sunny to cloudy condition. Meanwhile, an average temperature difference between air temperatures inside and outside of the cushion was 18.1 \u00b0C. Therefore, system electricity feasibility and potential in solar energy utilization have been verified. For cushion structures, temperatures on structural ETFE membranes used to resist external loads were within the acceptable range and pressure performance was satisfactory. Therefore, structure feasibility has been demonstrated. This study reveals the technical feasibility of ETFE cushion structure integrated photovoltaic.

This paper presents an integrated approach to quantitatively evaluate the performance of SWH in the obstructed scenes of arbitrary geometric complexity by coupling the radiation model in the urban resource flow tool CitySim with the SWH model developed in TRNSYS. A case study is conducted to illustrate the effect of the obstructions on daily and annual thermal performance and annual primary energy consumption of SWH. The results from the case study reveal that the SWH with typical configurations in the obstructed context may consume more primary energy than conventional water heater does, however this is not the case for the SWH in the unobstructed context. Fortunately, using the proposed approach can effectively avoid this problem.

Two prototype CP-TSC systems were installed onto an unoccupied 1960s multi-storey residential building at Oxford Brookes University and operated for 95 days during the winter of 2010/2011.

In addition, consideration of the BIPV generation quantity which has been installed at several diverse places is currently almost behind within region in Korea. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to evaluate the BIPV generation and to be base data of reducing rate depending on regional installation angles using PVpro which was verified by measured data. Various conditions were an angle of inclination and azimuth under six major cities: Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan, Gwangju, Jeju-si for the BIPV system generation analysis. As the results, Seoul showed the lowest BIPV generation: 1,054kWh/kWp.year, and Jeju-si have 5percent more generation: 1,108.0kWh/kWp.year than Seoul on horizontal plane. Gwangju and Daejeon turned out to have similar generation of result, and Busan showed the highest generation: 1,193.5kWh/kWp.year, which was increased by over 13percent from Seoul on horizontal plane. Another result, decreasing rate of BIPV generation depending on regional included angle indicate that the best position was located on azimuth: 0\u00b0(The south side) following the horizontal position(an angle of inclination: 30\u00b0).

Along with fast development, not only domestic hot water supply is needed, but also space heating and cooling are required. Also, limited roof space is another key barrier that should be considered. Furthermore, most of the building integration with solar collectors are mounted on the roof top by flat or tilt angle at present.

Solar power as a source of low carbon energy is an essential component for the sustainability of cities and its implementation and management, through urban planning practices, can play a strategic role in improving the energy efficiency of cities. Within this framework, the amount of energy provided by the integration of photovoltaic systems into existing buildings and their energy consumption, are two key indicators to identify the neighborhoods of the city that behave as urban units with positive, negative or balanced energy performances.

It is thus essential to properly evaluate and compare the PV temperature conditions of different PV module categories (in terms of PV technology and material type). Several explicit correlations exist for the evaluation of the PV module temperature, among which the simplest and most handy is a linear expression (i.e. Tmod=Tamb+k G) which links Tmod with the ambient temperature (Tamb) and the incident solar radiation flux (G). Within this expression the value of the dimensional parameter k, known as the Ross coefficient, depends on several aspects (i.e. module type, wind velocity and integration characteristics).

This paper investigates cost reductions due to learning-bydoing (LBD) using comprehensive data on all solar PV installations in California from 2002 to 2012. We develop a model of installer firm pricing behavior that allows for economies of scale, market power, and dynamic pricing to quantify both appropriable and non-appropriable LBD. We find strong evidence for both, suggesting a role for solar PV subsidies to improve economic efficiency by addressing a non-appropriable LBD positive externality. However, our results suggest that the California Solar Initiative cannot be justified by non-appropriable LBD alone.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2186501606"}}

Abstract Recently, the local government of South Tyrol, a province in the alpine area in the north of Italy, has defined the guidelines for an energy and climate package with targets for 2050 where it is stated that - The yearly CO 2 emission per capita will be reduced to less than 1.5 tons (less than 4 tons per capita by 2020 as intermediate target) - 90% of the energy need will be covered by renewables (at least 75% by 2020 as intermediate target). Specifically, energy production from photovoltaics will contribute towards those targets with a total installed power of 300 MW by 2020 (around 0.6\u00a0kW per capita considering population as of 2012) and 600 MW by 2050 (around 1.2\u00a0kW per capita considering population as of 2012). These figures start from a baseline of PV installed power in the province at the end of 2012 of 220 MW (around 0.45\u00a0kW per capita, around 0.28\u00a0kW per capita in Italy for comparison). Although both targets seem easily within reach, it is nonetheless important to lay the right foundation through favourable legislation and long term planning. It is within these context that a detailed analysis of the real PV potential (as comprehensive and effectively exploitable) of the area is proposed so to understand how ambitious those targets really are and to provide data and information for future energy and strategy planning. In this work, in an innovative approach, the impact of novel solutions on non-conventional surfaces were also included such as PV installations on transport infrastructure, avalanche barriers, artificial lakes, etc. High altitude installations were also taken into account due to the high irradiance values in the alpine area which are comparable to those in South of Italy (up to 2200 kWh/m 2 per year). Limitations due to costs, phasing out of generous incentives programs, restrictive laws (for instance, architectural and environmental constraints) were considered, too. The different technical aspects will be presented from the use of existing solar cadastres and databases to statistical analysis based on the morphology of different urban contexts. The roof (and facade) potential will then be added to the potential from the above mentioned non-conventional surfaces with the final aim of providing a figure for PV potential that takes into account planning permissions, restrictions, structural limitations, current legislation, visual impact and costs.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1985688489"}}

Even though the integration of renewable energies in new buildings is technically easy, the rise of solar thermal systems in the French market of energy renovation is limited by recurring constraints of implementation related to the installation of the storage tank. This is the reason why the Integrated Solar Collector (ISC) constitutes a very promising concept to develop. For both new buildings and renovation of the existing buildings, the ISC gives the opportunity to reduce the cost of installation and operation comparatively to a conventional Solar Domestic Hot Water System, because of their simplicity and passive operating process (without pump, nor controller). This second advantage is extremely important for the development prospects of the solar thermal market which is currently slowed down by the level of investment. The third advantage of our new ISC is the possibility of successful architectural integration, contrary to the currently available solutions with the storage installed on the roof. We developed a new concept of ISC adapted to the energy renovation with a multidisciplinary approach. Its design took into account various aspects: architectural integration (storage bellow the collector), energy performance (solar heat transfer at the bottom of the storage, fully insulated storage) and technological constraints (freezing risk). The project made it possible to study on the one hand its global performance (stratification, solar fraction) and on the other hand the free convective heat transfers inside the storage cavity. The approach used both numerical (architectural draft and design of the prototype, global modelling, and velocity / temperature fields) and experimental tools (test of heat, PIV on a cavity heated at the bottom, test of the prototype). The first prototype of ISC puts forward very satisfactory energy performances. Improvements are possible by enhancing thermal stratification in the storage system.

Methods of determining energy efficiency of solar collectors and graphical interpretation of their thermal characteristics are presented in order to show how different collector types can be evaluated for their use in buildings in different weather conditions and applications. Use of photovoltaics (PV) in buildings is also considered. Physical fundamentals of the internal PV effect are presented. Technologies of solar PV cells and systems are described along with different operating modes. The stress is put on technologies applied in buildings. It is emphasized that the dual nature of building elements, with coherency between architecture and energy production (PV systems and solar heating), will be standard in solar self-energy sufficient buildings. To give a full picture of solar active systems applied in buildings, solar cooling technologies are also discussed. It is underlined that sorption cooling technologies may help in solving a problem of working fluid overheating in the collector loop and in storage encountered in solar combisystems (i.e., space heating plus hot water heating).", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2488547320"}}

Solar energy is one of the comparable candidates. Solar energy is widely available and it is free of cost. Solar energy can be converted into direct current electricity by PV effect. We are also trying on the practical usage of static electricity. In this paper, we study about the utilization of solar energy and building solar wall system. A significant amount of research and development work on the photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) technology has been carried out in developed nations, but that was not the case in India.

One of the problems with solar flat plate collectors for domestic water heating is that they produce more energy in the summer months, when the domestic hot water needs are lower than in winter months. This causes a significant difference between supply and demand and thus overheating during the summer. A method to avoid this problem is to design solar collector fields that offer a 100% of the water needs in the summer, but a small percentage during the winter, which is certainly not ideal. In this work, ray tracing is used to design a solar thermal collector that offers a more uniform production during the year. A novel geometry is chosen where the collector is split in two parts, a curved absorber and a mini parabolic concentrator. The concentrator is designed to concentrate the radiation during the midday hours of winter days and to not doing it in the midday hours of summer days. This increases the energy produced in winter and prevents the installation from overheating. In order to study the hours when this geometry will concentrate the solar radiation, ray tracing is used. As the solar collector has a design that allows the collector to be easily integrated into a facade, the simulations in the most useful architectural integration positions are simulated, those are horizontal positions, but vertical positions or any other position are suitable if the collector is installed on a roof. For each position, the amount of hours where the whole collector is working and the total radiation captured are calculated and compared with the solar radiation captured by an equivalent flat surface, which would corresponds to conventional flat plate collectors. Simulation results shows how for a concentrator designed to work properly in the 5 midday hours during the winter solstice it will not work during the 5 midday hours during the summer solstice, avoiding overheating.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2020248810"}}

Our results indicate that, on average, 100% of the projected demand for water at most SEZs and CREZs could be met by reclaimed wastewater if photovoltaics (PV) are installed. If concentrating solar power (CSP) is installed, fewer SEZs could meet their potential water demand from alternative sources. Only 10 of the CREZs were located near sources of produced water, but of those, 100% of the water demand at the CREZ was met in 8 cases, regardless of the technology installed.

Since these sources are depleting at faster rate and cost of energy is increasing simultaneously, so conversion of renewable form of energy is much desired now. Most of energy that we are using is non-renewable resources which increase the pollution and amount of CO2 in environment so it required using renewable and clean energy.

In spite of the fact that the earth and its atmosphere continually receive 1.7 \u00d7 1017 watts of radiation from the sun, in the portfolio of sustainable and environment friendly energy options, which is about 16% of the world\u2019s energy consumption and mostly met by biomass, only a paltry 0.04% is accredited to solar. First and second generation solar cells offer mature technologies for applications. The most important difficulty with regards to integration with structures is not only the additional cost, but also the lack of sufficient knowledge in managing the available energy smartly and efficiently. The incorporation of PV as a part of building fabric greatly reduces the overall costs compared with retrofitting. BIPV (Building Integrated photovoltaic) is a critical technology for establishing aesthetically pleasing solar structures. Infusing PV and building elements is greatly simplified with some of the second generation thin film technologies now manufactured as flexible panels. The same holds true for 3rd generation technologies under development such as, and dye- and quantum dot- sensitized solar cells.

Abstract To further increase the efficiency of PV modules, a variety of technical approaches targeting losses on cell and module level are pursued. Module efficiency is usually stated at standard test conditions (STC) whereas conditions during operation in the field are most of the time very different. From a customer perspective the specific energy yield is the far more important parameter, as it has immediate effect on the levelized costs of electricity(LCOE), which describes the costs of a kWh produced. The specific energy yield is strongly dependent on module characteristics at different operating points. Some of these properties such as low light characteristic, thermal behaviour or incident angle dependency can be influenced by technological changes resulting in a change of specific energy yield. To predict the quantitative effect of technological changes on annual energy production, module characteristics can be determined by outdoor measurements and fed into a simulation tool to quantify the gain or loss in annual energy yield of the changes applied. In this paper, two technological changes on cell and module level are investigated. First, the effect of anti-reflective coated glass is evaluated. The second investigation is related to a PERC cell structure. Therefore measured outdoor data from a photovoltaic test site are analysed to evaluate changes in module design with respect to their effect on outdoor performance. The results are compared to long term measurements of system installations to confirm the differences in energy yield. It is shown that technological changes can be applied on module and cell level that not only increase power under standard test conditions, but also lead to an additional improvement of the energy harvest per kWp and thus lower the LCOE.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2036576314"}}

A relationship coefficient f was provided whose values are compared to those from a PV array operating in a free standing mode on a terrace. A theoretical model to predict f was elaborated. According to the analysis, the coefficient f takes higher values for PV modules embedded on a roof compared to the free standing PV array. The wind effect is much stronger for the free standing PV than for any BIPV configuration, either the PV is part of the roof, or placed upon the roof, or is placed outside a window like a shadow hanger.

For very low wind speeds the effect of the angle of inclination, \u03b2, of the PV module with respect to the horizontal on PV temperature is clear.

The basic operating principle of Photovoltaic device is the conversion of solar irradiation into electricity. There are several applications of this principle. In Nigeria, most solar PV projects are designed for street lighting, water pumping and general stand-alone/minigrid rural electrifications. However, several solar PV projects being installed in various parts of this country fail to meet the minimum life-span due to a number of limiting factors. These include poor or improper fundamental design, use of sub-standard components, adoption of poor installation procedure by inexperienced personnel, bad construction/civil works among other factors. This has become a problem in the country and many are beginning to feel disgusted with solar PV projects as the heavy investments in such projects do not seem to be commensurate with their performances and satisfactions derivable. This paper therefore presents an overview of the performances of solar PV projects and a concise procedural approach to the implementation of standard solar PV projects in the country. In-depth analysis of performances of existing systems was also considered and the limiting factors identified with specific recommendations for improvement. We believe that if power projects are designed and executed properly by experienced technical experts, using the appropriate components and best technical procedures, standard PV projects with maximum performance output could be achieved.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1487844828"}}

Abstract Recently, throughout the world, there is a special emphasis on the development of a photovoltaic industry. In fact, the solar photovoltaic (PV) is now, after hydro and wind power, the third most important renewable energy source in terms of globally installed capacity. The growth rate of the PV industry during 2011 increased by almost 70 percent, an outstanding level among all renewable technologies. Especially in Mexico, there is great potential for this kind of systems. In July 2007 the CRE (Energy regulation commission) published the grid connection contract. This contract opens the possibility of installing small solar PV systems connected to the grid (up to 10 kWp for residential applications and 30 kWp for industrial applications). This allowed for an important growth of the photovoltaic industry. Due to that important development of the PV industry, there is a need for engineers trained to design, install, and evaluate this kind of systems. The Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (UAEMEX) offers a new engineering program related to the development of sustainable energy systems. This kind of engineering program requires special equipment for experimentation and practice. Part of this equipment is very expensive and is designed just for certain applications. Specialists at UAEMEX detected the need of a system to evaluate and demonstrate the application of PV modules, but they also found that most of the systems in the market are too small and are not capable of evaluating different arrangements. This paper sets forth the design of a mobile system to evaluate PV modules and arrangements. This system is useful, not only for demonstration practices, but also for experimentation with different materials and types of PV cells. The design allows the completion of 2 or 4 PV modules with different positions and inclination. Also, it is prepared to simulate some interferences and shadows on the modules in order to evaluate their effect. The prototype is equipment with a data acquisition system that will be used to obtain the PV module curves. Also, it will be used to evaluate the atmospheric and shadow effects on these modules. This prototype will be used to complement the learning of solar-PV systems, but also to meet the needs of basic science, math, and engineering teaching objectives in an integrated and hands-on way. A basic description of the design of the system proposed is set forth in this paper with a comparative analysis of the systems in the market. Finally, there is a summary of practices that may be performed with the equipment proposed.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1993327695"}}

The developed environment is called Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Park, and will be built in the city of Tucuru\u00ed, state of Par\u00e1, Brazil.The park will be part of a Technology Facility near the Hydroelectric Power Plant of Tucuru\u00ed, which is owned and operated by ELETROBRAS ELETRONORTE, and will be open to visitors of all ages, mainly to schools. The article describes the projects to be installed in the playground, which are: a small auto-race track for model cars with batteries recharged by photovoltaic solar energy, playground toys designed to produce energy when in use, an artificial lake decorated with toys driven by solar energy. The small speedway is intended for RC car races, with their batteries being charged by photovoltaic modules, through a charge controller and a lead-acid battery bank. The playground toys, such as slide, swing, teeter-totter and carousel are driven while the children enjoy themselves and the energy generated by their movement is displayed in a power indicator. These toys have electromechanical energy conversion systems made of speed multipliers, DC generators and electronic systems for power conditioning, using lead-acid batteries, converters and DC/AC inverters. The produced energy can be used to recharge the electronic portable devices of the visitors (such as cell phones, notebooks, tablets, and so on.) The artificial lake has toys driven by photovoltaic energy, and has also a photovoltaic pumping system, to return the water to an elevated reservoir and allow its recirculation through gravitational means to the small lake.

After an initial phase of great diffusion of large Photovoltaic (PV) systems installed on the ground, the recent evolution of the feed-in tariffs makes the Building Integrated PV (BIPV) systems for residential, commercial and industrial users, the more befitting application of the PV technology. Unfortunately, the building integration implies some critical issues on the operation of principal components, such as the PV panels or the grid-connected inverter, typical of this kind of installation and not so important in the case of ground mounted PV plants. These non-idealities can be due to: presence of obstacles near the PV panels, like trees, poles, antennas, architectural elements (chimneys, barriers, buildings in the neighbourhood); non-optimal orientation of the PV field (not Southward) or with different orientations among the sub-fields, with consequent production asymmetry between morning and evening or mismatch; sub-optimal tilt angle of the PV modules, as it is fixed by the building roof; not-efficient cooling of the PV panels, which can cause temperature gradients both horizontally, between PV modules in the central area of the field and the peripheral ones, and vertically, between panels installed in the bottom and in the top of a structure, due to the direction of the cooler flow. The consequences of these non-idealities is the subject of this PhD dissertation, from both theoretical, through convenient simulation tools, and experimental viewpoints. The most evident of these effects is the mismatch of the currentvoltage characteristics of the PV field panels. With the aim of illustrating the analysis methodologies used to study the mismatch effect on all the PV system components, a specific case study is considered, constituted by a large BIPV system (almost 1MWp) installed on the roof of a wholesale warehouse", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W164900864"}}

Solar energy is a field that has grown immensely during the last decade, along with the in- creased public awareness of environmental challenges and sustainable development. While roof-installed solar cells have conventionally been mounted on aluminium panels, the idea of solar cells that are more integrated in the building design are gaining more and more in- terest. One innovation in this field is the solar sandwich, developed by SOLEV Entreprenad, which combines the functions of a roof with insulation and a surface where solar cells can be installed, without any conventional solar panels.  This thesis consists of a life cycle assessment of this solar sandwich as well as life cycle as- sessments of two typical roofs with conventional solar panels. Four sensitivity analyses were conducted in order to investigate some of the methodological and modelling choices that were made. The results of these sensitivity analyses did not alter the final results signifi- cantly. This suggests that the model used for the calculations is robust.  The results of the impact assessment show that the environmental impact of the solar sand- wich is similar to that of a conventional wooden roof with solar panels. In four out of five impact categories \u2013 global warming potential, acidification potential, human toxicity poten- tial and land use \u2013 the solar sandwich was found to perform better than the conventional roofs. The impact category where the solar sandwich performed the worst, by far, was strato- spheric ozone depletion potential.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W178443866"}}

A significant amount of globat energy consumption takes place in the built environment, with as collateral effect CO2-related climate change. One of the strategies to realize a significant CO2 reduction is by integrating photovoltaic modules in the building envelope (BIPV). Disadvantages of BIPV include a possibly lower energy output and a possibly decreased life span due to the lack of optimal cooling of the PV modules. Currently, cooling of PV modules is usually realized by passive back-string ventilation, which is under strain when integration PV modules in the building envelope. In this study, a comparative field study of BIPV is conducted in the field lab 'The District of Tomorrow'to generate insight into BIPV efficiency as a function of back-string ventilation. This paper presents a selection of the monitoring results of the realized system, consisting of 24 PY modules in 4 segments with a total of 6000 Wp output with different amounts of back-string ventilation. The measurements indicate that in a moderate climate BIPV solutions without back-string ventilation result in increased operating temperatures, lower electricity output and condensation between PV modules and rooftop surface.

Innovative, low carbon technologies are already available for use in the construction of buildings, but the impact of their specification on construction projects is unclear. This exploratory research identifies issues which arise following the specification of BIPV in non-residential construction projects. Rather than treating the inclusion of a new technology as a technical problem, the research explores the issue from a socio-technical perspective to understand the accommodations which the project team makes and their effect on the building and the technology. The paper is part of a larger research project which uses a Social Construction of Technology Approach (SCOT) to explore the accommodations made to working practices and design when Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic (BIPV) technology is introduced. The approach explores how the requirements of the technology from different groups of actors (Relevant Social Groups or RSG's) give rise to problems and create solutions. As such it rejects the notion of a rational linear view of innovation diffusion; instead it suggests that the variety and composition of the Relevant Social Groups set the agenda for problem solving and solutions as the project progresses. The research explores the experiences of three people who have extensive histories of involvement with BIPV in construction, looks at how SCOT can inform our understanding of the issues involved and identifies themes and issues in the specification of BIPV on construction projects. A key finding concerns the alignment of inflection points at which interviewees have found themselves changing from one RSG to another as new problems and solutions are identified. The points at which they change RSG often occurred at points which mirror conventional construction categories (in terms of project specification, tender, design and construction).", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2159310206"}}

This study analyses the performance of power plant, BAPV and BIPV by comparing the measured performance data. In case of power plant, the one in Gyoungsang, Daegu has a better performance than the ones in Chungnam, Daejeon and Gyounggi, Seoul. This is because of regional solar radiation condition. Among the three types, BIPV performs better than power plant or BAPV. Power plant and BAPV have almost the same performance ratio, which is 10%. In case of BIPV, performance is influenced by many factors. So, many study and analysis need to be made to make performance index of location.

Analysis of the Current Situation, and Future Potential in Urban Areas of Argentina. To achieve urban sustainability, the access to solar radiation must be a guaranteed right in the cities. There is an urgent need to review designs, patterns and constructive technologies to obtain energy efficient buildings providing thermal and lighting comfort for their occupants through the maximum utilization of available renewable resources of energy. Although solar radiation is one of the most valuable resources of clean and renewable energy, the access to the same seldom constitutes a social right. When analyzing the viability of a bioclimatic design in a new building or in the recycling of an existing one, it is fundamental to know what the solar available potential is, especially in urban consolidated areas where the characteristics of the structure significantly determine the access and availability of the resources. This problem is present in all Latin American cities, emerging from a Spanish colonial grid layout. In order to reverse this tendency, it is necessary to ensure the future free utilization of solar power destined for central and water heating in urban surroundings regardless of their densities. However, the reality indicates that the legal existing frame in many countries of Latin America does not consider the renewable resources as appropriable. This paper presents the evaluation of the impact of regulations in medium scale Argentine cities, in relation to the solar potential of buildings located in consolidated areas.

Air-conditioning is one of the major consumers of electrical energy in many parts of the world today and already today air-conditioning causes energy shortage in for example China. The demand can be expected to increase because of changing working times, increased comfort expectations and global warming. Airconditioning systems in use are most often built around a vapour compression system driven by grid-electricity. However, most ways of generating the electricity today, as well as the refrigerants being used in traditional vapour compression systems, have negative impact on the environment. Solar air-conditioning might be a way to reduce the demand for electricity. In addition many solar air-conditioning systems are constructed in ways that eliminate the need for CFC, HCFC or HFC refrigerants. This research work is based on the Peltier effect with which we can cool a specific area without using compressor which take a huge consumption of electricity. And this system is driven by solar energy using solar plates, battery, transformer peltier module and heat sink. This paper deals with a wide range of components, from room air-conditioners to solar.Conventional compressor run cooling devices have many drawbacks pertaining to energy efficiency and the use of CFC refrigerants. Both these factors indirectly point to the impending scenario of global warming. As most of the electricity generation relies on the coal power plants, which add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is the major cause of global warming. Although researches are going on, better alternatives for the CFC refrigerants is still on the hunt. So instead of using conventional air conditioning systems, other products which can efficiently cool a person are to be devised. By using other efficient cooling mechanisms we can save the electricity bills and also control the greenhouse gases that are currently released into the atmosphere .Airconditioning is one of the major. Collectors, which can be used as subcomponents in a solar air-conditioning system. However, most of the components and subsystems covered are not only suitable for solar air-conditioning. Some components are used for electrically, mechanically or heat driven air-conditioning. And of course other sources of mechanical energy or heat could be used for powering these components. Other components are used for solar energy collection and storage, which can be used in solar energy system with other purposes than just driving a solar airconditioning system. In this research work the idea was to build an alternative for AC and to provide Air conditioning effect. The research aims to design and build a miniature prototype of thermoelectric cooling system for a conventional air conditioned to provide air conditioning to reduce the consumption of electricity and to reduce the pollution.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2340155046"}}

One of the most abundant renewable energy resources is solar energy. In the construction sector, buildings are the largest human fabric intercepting solar radiation; they are a driving sector for developing solar energy uses especially those for generating electricity; Photovoltaics (PV). PV can produce on-site electricity with no harmful emissions. Generally, PV modules (PVs) are placed as a lay-on or additive solution to the building external envelope. Initially, they were secured to the roof or onto a facade using a metal structure with the sole function of generating energy. Afterwards, PVs were thought of as buildings components part of the building external envelope, thus becoming multifunctional construction materials bringing \u201cadded value\u201d to building materials. Hence, the idea of integrating PVs in buildings arose and the Building Integrated Photovoltaic systems (BIPVs) concept was introduced. There are various typologies of BIPVs and vast number of factors/constraints affects the dual usage of PVs as electrical elements and architectural ones. There is a lack of consensus in the methodologies used for the BIPV implementation; there is a minority of tools connecting these factors in a way that enables stakeholders analysing BIPVs alternatives, thus choosing the most appropriate one. Hence, it is obvious that designing with BIPVs requires a much more holistic perspective than what has been typically applied for decision-making in the past. This approach focuses on the interaction between BIPVs basics/characteristics, and the constraints affecting their suitability for application. The paper will focus on one factor (tilt and orientation) and its effect on one BIPV typology (roof systems). At the end of this paper, a preference matrix will be conducted which resembles the interrelationship between PV roof systems and tilt and orientation factor. The aim of paper is to provide architects with an effective supporting tool to analyse different BIPV alternatives for any building within a specific location, to choose the most appropriate BIPV system.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2526731461"}}

Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technologies are gaining interest from both the research community and the building industry due to their versatile capability to be incorporated to both old and new building designs. From the literature, not much research was done on investigating real-world performance assessment of Copper Indium Gallium di-Selenide (CIGS) thin-film systems in a tropical locale. This paper addresses this gap. The Northern Territory (NT) was chosen to conduct this study due to its unique climate; a distinct wet and dry cycle and a cycloneprone environment. The objective of this research is to evaluate the performance of a 1.5kWp CIGS BIPV system under these real-world environmental effects; dust accumulation, fauna droppings, natural shading and rig temperature. 5-minute measured data were obtained, over 4 months, and three clear sunny days (each for every month) were identified for analysis. Experimental results showed a qualitative relationship between the aforementioned environmental effects on the system efficiency. In particular, the effect of dust accumulation and bird droppings were the two identified dominant causes of the gradual decrease in the expected peak power output of the system. The effects of natural shading and temperature on the system efficiency were also presented in this paper. This study forms a solid foundation for further studies of the environmental effects on PV efficiency.

Conventional HVAC systems rely heavily on energy generated from fossil fuels, which are being rapidly depleted. This together with a growing demand for cost-effective infrastructure and appliances has necessitated new installations and major retrofits in occupied buildings to achieve energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. As well as contributing to negative environmental outcomes, HVAC system usage is having a serious impact on electrical infrastructure. As such, the development of clean energy air conditioning units remains an urgent engineering challenge. Solar HVAC systems, which convert thermal energy into cool air, are known to be an efficient source of heating and cooling. Unlike traditional HVAC systems, solar air conditioning units produce maximum cooling capacity when the sun is fierce; that is, they are most efficient during the hottest part of the day, in stark contrast to traditional air conditioning units, which are less effective as temperatures increase. This study represents a synergetic framework of system identification, design, development and performance evaluation of a newly-configured air conditioning system to target energy efficiency and environmental sustainability in buildings. In this study, we have originally designed and developed a single-effect lithium bromide (LiBr)-water absorption air-conditioning system in which hot water is fully supplied by vacuum solar collectors without using any other energy sources such as gas or electricity. Water-cooled condenser of the chiller is supported by a cross-flow cooling tower. In this system, by using water as the working fluid (refrigerant), one can avoid the use of ozone-depletion chlorofluorocarbons and hydro chlorofluorocarbons. Thermodynamic and heat transfer models for absorption chiller components are described in detail. Using these models, a computer simulation software named ABSYS is developed to design the absorption chiller and drive its optimum operating conditions. Thermodynamic design data for single-effect absorption chiller are presented together with the possible combinations of the operating temperatures and the corresponding concentrations in the absorber and generator. The effect of various operating conditions on the performance and output of the absorption refrigeration system are then evaluated. Another computer code is developed by using TRNSYS to evaluate the transient performance of the entire system. Several field tests are carried out to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the system. The utilisation of the solar energy as the heat input to the generator of the absorption chiller is reported. Since Australia has great solar resources and large air condition demand, this system can be uniquely suited in Australia. However, absorption cooling technology and especially the application of solar energy in this technology is still in its infancy in Australia. The proposed design can be helpful to accelerate a global clean society to achieve its sustainable targets, especially in Australia, which has\u2026", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2561835018"}}

The goal of this proposed text is to provide a recourse for engineering students interested in the design and operation of solar electric, solar thermal, wind, and other renewable systems. Solar and wind energy systems have flourished throughout the United States in the last few years as the public calls for reduced dependence on foreign oil. Government programs have been established to meet the public demand. Many states have passed legislation that requires electric utilities to include a portfolio of renewable energy sources in their generation mix. The resulting public demand has stimulated the growth of an industry that provides wind and solar systems, and many small businesses have grown to install these systems. Training programs and courses are now ubiquitous as the demand for designers and installer's increases. Almost every educational institution offers renewable energy classes or curriculum. The organization of this book begins with concepts and terminology for power and energy - the basics needed to communicate and understand the subject. Conventional power systems are briefly discussed to understand the concepts used in the integration of renewable power systems. Discussion then moves to the design and installation of a small residential photovoltaic system and wind generator connected to the electric utility grid. With this background, the student is able to begin developing ideas for a class project. The chapters following concepts and background review delve into the details of photovoltaic and wind systems as interconnected or stand-alone designs. Estimating and predicating energy production is presented using industry distribution functions and online programs. Concepts of temperature coefficients, synchronization, power conversion, and system protection are explained and practiced. These concepts are applied to residential and small commercial systems and later extrapolated to large system design. Economic analysis is presented using basic methodologies such as payback and rate of return. The methodology to develop advanced analysis is introduced using spreadsheets.

The purpose of this investigation was to find out the conditions for micro production with solar cells for Building 73 at Innovatum in Trollhattan.The technology for a solar cell system and its main components have been investigated and reported. Example of two important components in addition to the solar cell module is the inverter and the AC switch. The inverter serves to convert the voltage to an alternating voltage. The AC switch is important for the ability to disconnect the solar cell from overhead electricity network if necessary.There are laws and regulations that may affect a planned building permission. In this case the building belongs to an old industrial area where design issues are important.Another item discussed is building-specific conditions. For example, measurement of free roof space, roof pitch, cardinal point and ceiling coverings.Subsequently conducted a market research. Two different options for micro production where made.One of the proposals is a facility with solar cells at 30kW from the dealer Nordic Solar on racks at an angle of 30\u00b0. The proposal includes a package of solar cells modules manufactured by Eopply. The second proposal is a package of solar cells at 100kW from the dealer Svea Solar, for installation directly on the roof with the roof's existing slope. This package has solar cells modules manufactured by CSUN. A big difference besides the effect on solar cells installations is that the Svea Solar has an attachment that does not require drilling for attachment to the roof.At first glance, the proposal with solar cells modules of 100kW feels optimally, given the installed power, and that the damage to the roof is minimized. However, there are aspects like snow removal in the winter. These enable the second option with solar cells modules at 30kW mounted on racks will be more appropriate in this comparison", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W332886927"}}

Buildings energy consumption is rising continuously with massive urbanization progress, which then results in high greenhouse gas emission. A standing example is the urbanization process going on in the south-west part of China. Much has been discussed for improving building energy performance. However, to take another point of view, renewable energy source for buildings is a solution worth considering, for instance STES, which gains thermal energy from the sun, delivers it to buildings for space heating and hot tap water, also restores the solar energy in hot seasons in the storage system for the need of cold season.The aim of this paper is to couple the technology of STES with practical situation, explore the possibility of applying STES in south-west of China. This thesis work takes an estimation approach to weigh the possibility. The building project studied in this thesis is a campus project in the city of Guiyang, one of four major cities in the region of south-west China.Case study involves existing STES projects in Munich Germany and Anneberg Sweden, the performance evaluation of the Anneberg project is later to serve as an example in system gain & losses proportion, to guide the estimation work of the campus project.The estimation conclusion is drawn based on a cross-sectional analysis method, take the technology of STES, the practiced STES project and building projects in China as three loops visually, and observe how much they overlap each other. Behind the visual illustration, the overlapping is assessed with several factors, for instance possibility of storage system at location, possible STES performance and solar irradiation condition at site location etc. If most of these factors are checked to be \u201cOk\u201d or \u201cGood\u201d, then the overlapping area is considered \u201clarge\u201d enough, and therefore suggests a decent chance to implement STES system in the south-west China.A solar gain and sunlight simulation from a new police station energy consumption report assists in calculating the possible solar gain for the campus project, as the very close distance between these two sites (30 km) promises them the very similar solar irradiation condition. While the energy consumption of the studied campus project offers the energy demand for space heating and hot tap water in the need of 19,000 students, which is to be evaluated as the task of the STES system in the estimation work. Both building project reports are filed by GARDI (Architecture design research institution of Guizhou).Some key factors have been calculated and estimated, the heat demand of the studied campus project in Guiyang is 5,558 MWh/year, and the possible solar gain of this campus complexity is 4,900 MWh/year based on the gain & losses proportion of the Anneberg project evaluation. Due to the very different climate condition of Guiyang and Anneberg, as well as other uncertain factors such as effective roof area, solar collector efficiency, a sensitivity analysis evaluated the result with different parameters in changes of percentage. Final results in the changes of effective roof area at 80% and 85 %, borehole losses at 50% and 45%, available solar gain at 38%, STES system is shown to be capable of providing sufficient heat to buildings. If the heating demand and hot tap water, in the case of the campus project alone are all covered by STES system, there will be a reduction in CO2 emission of 5,368 tons/year.Cross-sectional analysis concludes four out of eight factors checked as \u201cGood\u201d and two as \u201cOk\u201d, other two as \u201cUnsure\u201d. Other three cities (Chengdu, Kunming, and Chongqing) are brought to comparison later regarding climate condition. Besides Guiyang, two out of three are evaluated to have potential of STES implementation according to their sun hours, annual average temperature etc. STES system is estimated to be possible for implementation in south-west of China as the conclusion.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W338248932"}}

The fourteen (14) solar photovoltaic systems that have already been installed at CCSF municipal facilities are assisting in the reduction of fossil-fuel use, and reduction of greenhouse gases from fossil combustion. The MUNI Ways & Structures Center roof has a relatively low weight-bearing capacity (3.25 pounds per square foot) and use of traditional crystalline panels was therefore rejected. Consequently it was decided to use the best available highest efficiency Building-Integrated PV (BIPV) technology, with consideration for reliability and experience of the manufacturer which can meet the low weight-bearing capacity criteria. The original goal of the project was to provide an opportunity to monitor the results of the BIPV technology and compare these results to other City and County of San Francisco installed PV systems. The MUNI Ways and Structures Center was acquired from the Cookson Doors Company, which had run the Center for many decades. The building was renovated in 1998, but the existing roof had not been designed to carry a large load. Due to this fact, a complete roofing and structural analysis had to be performed to match the available roof loading to the existing and/or new solar PV technology, and BIPV was considered an excellent solution for this structure with the roof weight limitations. The solar BIPV system on the large roof area was estimated to provide about 25% of the total facility load with an average of 52,560 kWh per month. In order to accomplish the goals of the project, the following steps were performed: 1. SFPUC and consultants evaluated the structural capability of the facility roof, with recommendations for improvements necessary to accommodate the solar PV system and determine the suitable size of the system in kilowatts. The electrical room and switchgear were evaluated for any improvements necessary and to identify any constraints that might impede the installation of necessary inverters, transformers or meters. 2. Development of a design-build Request for Proposal (RFP) to identify the specifications for the solar PV system, and to include SFPUC technical specifications, equipment warranties and performance warranties. Due to potential labor issues in the local solar industry, SFPUC adjusted the terms of the RFP to more clearly define scope of work between electricians, roofers and laborers. 3. Design phase of project included electrical design drawings, calculations and other construction documents to support three submittals: 50% (preliminary design), 90% (detailed design) and 100% (Department of Building Inspection permit approved). 4. Installation of solar photovoltaic panels, completion of conduit and wiring work, connection of inverters, isolation switches, meters and Data Acquisition System by Contractor (Department of Public Works). 5. Commissioning of system, including all necessary tests to make the PV system fully functional and operational at its rated capacity of 100 kW (DC-STC). Following completion of these steps, the solar PV system was installed and fully integrated by late October 2013. The interconnection with PG&E utility grid was completed and the system began generating power on November 21, 2013. The projected annual energy generation for the system is estimated at 127,120 kWh/year.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4243240822"}}

Air-conditioning is one of the major consumers of electrical energy in many parts of the world today and already today air-conditioning causes energy shortage in for example China. The demand can be expected to increase because of changing working times, increased comfort expectations and global warming. Air-conditioning systems in use are most often built around a vapour compression system driven by grid-electricity. However, most ways of generating the electricity today, as well as the refrigerants being used in traditional vapour compression systems, have negative impact on the environment. Solar air-conditioning might be a way to reduce the demand for electricity. In addition many solar air-conditioning systems are constructed in ways that eliminate the need for CFC, HCFC or HFC refrigerants. This research work is based on the Peltier effect with which we can cool a specific area without using compressor which take a huge consumption of electricity. And this system is driven by solar energy using solar plates, battery, transformer peltier module and heat sink. This paper deals with a wide range of components, from room air-conditioners to solar.Conventional compressor run cooling devices have many drawbacks pertaining to energy efficiency and the use of CFC refrigerants. Both these factors indirectly point to the impending scenario of global warming. As most of the electricity generation relies on the coal power plants, which add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is the major cause of global warming. Although researches are going on, better alternatives for the CFC refrigerants is still on the hunt. So instead of using conventional air conditioning systems, other products which can efficiently cool a person are to be devised. By using other efficient cooling mechanisms we can save the electricity bills and also control the greenhouse gases that are currently released into the atmosphere .Air-conditioning is one of the major. Collectors, which can be used as subcomponents in a solar air-conditioning system. However, most of the components and subsystems covered are not only suitable for solar air-conditioning. Some components are used for electrically, mechanically or heat driven air-conditioning. And of course other sources of mechanical energy or heat could be used for powering these components. Other components are used for solar energy collection and storage, which can be used in solar energy system with other purposes than just driving a solar air-conditioning system. In this research work the idea was to build an alternative for AC and to provide Air conditioning effect. The research aims to design and build a miniature prototype of thermoelectric cooling system for a conventional air conditioned to provide air conditioning to reduce the consumption of electricity and to reduce the pollution.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4317648351"}}

With climate change and increasing energy consumption there is a need for a change from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Norway has adopted both the emissions reduction goals of the Kyoto Protocol and from EU directives, and an EU directive that targets energy use in commercial buildings. Because the energy prices are rising and the costs of PV are decreasing, PV is becoming an interesting alternative to reduce energy consumption in commercial buildings and as means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from commercial buildings. Building certification schemes are also giving the building sector incentives to reduce the environmental impact of buildings. In this thesis building certification using Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) is considered.   In the thesis, a case study in Oslo is used to quantify the potential for PV on commercial buildings in Norway, the feasibility of PV, emissions reduction by reducing energy demand from commercial buildings using PV, and PV's potential contribution on improving a commercial buildings BREEAM certification. The potential is determined by using a specific load provided to the case study based on the building's requirements to achieve goals of delivered energy based on the EU directive and Norwegian legislation on energy consumption of commercial buildings.   The solar resource of Oslo is determined for the different facades and roof according to their azimuthal angles and panel inclination using measured solar resource data. Using the adjusted solar resource values, the size of the PV system and inverters to meet the load for the worst case scenario is determined, an increase of the load by 25 % and 50 % is also considered. The determined system sizes are simulated in HOMER for an average year to determine the average energy production from the systems and to determine the feasibility of the systems. Using the average yearly performance the system's contribution to emissions reduction and to BREEAM certification is determined.   The thesis concludes that there is potential for PV on commercial buildings to meet a yearly load, but not a continuous load. PV systems are not feasible due to low irradiance and high system prices. The PV systems contribute significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from commercial buildings. The contribution of building integrated PV to BREEAM rating is marginal.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W50322209"}}

As a result of Stockholm stad\u2019s effort to become a fossil fuel free city by 2050, Stockholm Royal Seaport has been developed as an environmental area. This means that the area is supposed to become a worldwide leader within the area of environmental development. Part of this development includes that the properties in Stockholm Royal Seaport will minimize their energy consumption and, to some extent, become self-sufficient in electricity production. The roofs of the properties will be optimized for photovoltaic systems according to orientation, slope and size. This thesis includes a case study where five properties located in the neighborhood Hornslandet will be examined and evaluated. Hornslandet is part of the Royal Seaports construction phase \u201cNorra 2\u201d.The thesis aims to examine the possibilities for an implementation of photovoltaic systems on the properties in Hornslandet and evaluate how profitable it would be for the developer, Stockholmshem, to build properties that to some extent are self-sufficient. The thesis also aims to evaluate whether an implementation of photovoltaic systems will contribute to fulfill the goals that Stockholms stad has developed for the Royal Seaport.The case study has no customer but is intended for Stockholms stad and the developer Stockholmshem in order to increase their knowledge about how and if an implementation of photovoltaic systems may be able to contribute to an achievement of the objectives.The objectives that this thesis has evaluated include two specific objectives that Stockholms stad has developed for the buildings\u2019 energy consumption. These include that consumption for the buildings in construction phase Norra 2 shall not exceed 55kWh/m2 and year (Stockholms stad, 2014h) and that every building shall produce at least 30 % of its consumed building electricity (Stockholms stad, 2014d). This thesis has assumed that the first goal mentioned above is accomplished and then evaluated to which extent the second goal can be accomplished by installing photovoltaic systems on the buildings.The results from this case study have been compiled by simulating the solar radiation over Hornslandet with the software PVGIS. The simulation was later fundamental for the evaluation of the objectives and mainly concerns the goal that every building shall produce at least 30 % of its consumed building electricity. An evaluation of the area needed to implement photovoltaic systems to reach the objectives has also been carried out.

Solar energy constitutes one of the main alternatives for facing the energy problems of the future, taking into account the foreseeable depletion of the fossil fuels. Transpired solar air collectors are relatively simple alternatives, which do not need a continuous supervision and are mostly maintenance free. Their life cycle is relatively high, around 25 years, and the total investment can be fully recovered in the short-term.The aim of this master\u2019s thesis is to analyze the feasibility of installing transpired solar air collectors as secondary systems in big industrial buildings, for heating purposes. The collectors would be designed for compensating the heat losses of a building which is mainly heated up by a heat pump system. Precisely, this work tries to evaluate the profitability of installing these collectors in Gavle, taking into account the particularities of this location in the considered study.This project work is focused on testing if these systems can provide enough thermal energy for heating up big-sized industrial buildings. For this purpose, firstly, the heat demand of the building for each month was calculated; secondly, the maximum output from the collector was estimated, using WINSUN simulator; and, finally, the energy difference that had to be covered by the main system was calculated. Once this was done, the yearly running cost for the main system and the total investment for the transpired air solar collector were estimated.Due to the lack of experimental data, the obtained results can only be taken as approximations. All the calculations and estimations have been made using WINSUN, a simulator that has been configured according to the particularities of the project. The results show that the solar collector provides a total thermal output of 29.700 kWh/year (system which has a total investment of 77.000 SEK). The total heat demand of the building is estimated to be of 87.100 kWh/year, being 51.800 kWh/year fulfilled by the heat pump system (which has a yearly running cost of 24.000 SEK/year).

Solar Photovoltaic-based mini-grids have emerged as a viable option for the provision of electricity in such remote rural locations, where grid extension is either not techno-economically feasible or electricity supply is intermittent. Very often such projects are purely technology-driven and several attempts at delivering electricity services to such remote locations have not succeeded, owing to the lack of adequate attention given to important socio-economic factors such as promotion of livelihoods or the creation of strong local institutions that can own, operate and manage the project over its lifetime. This chapter aims to present an interdisciplinary framework for the development of mini-grid projects in remote rural locations, developed from field experience of actual implementation of projects by TERI. Using this framework as a guide, TERI has commissioned solar photovoltaic-based mini-grids in a cluster of five villages in the state of Odisha. The detailed design methodology, including modifications to standardised practices in order to customise and improve the performance of these solar mini-grids is presented in this chapter as a case study.

However, the system energy and economic performance has not been evaluated systematically. In this paper, the numerical evaluation of these two types of solar water heaters in different climate zones of China was reported on the aspects of system energy performance and economical return. The single-phase system is found having better cost payback period in all these cities, and can be a suitable choice except for locations with extreme cold weather. The two-phase design is an attractive and sustainable alternative since its thermal efficiency is higher under the same weather condition and this is important for supporting zero-carbon building design. On the other hand, it can be readily used to enhance the outside appearance of a building. Hence when considering climate adaptability and aesthetic compatibility, the potential of the two-phase system is higher.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2064166818"}}

Abstract This study describes an innovative occupancy and chilled-water storage-based operation sequence implemented in a solar-assisted air-conditioning system. The core purpose of this solar-assisted air-conditioning system is to handle the cooling and heating load of the Solar Energy Research Centre (CIESOL), thus minimising its environmental impact. In this study, the cooling mode was investigated with special attention focused on the chilled-water storage circuit. The critical concern is that the solar-assisted air-conditioning system should always operate considering the actual load conditions, not using an abstract maximum load that is predetermined during the system\u2019s design process, which can lead to energy waste during periods of low occupancy. Thus, the fundamental problem is to identify the optimum operation sequence for the solar-assisted air-conditioning system that provides the best energy performance. The significance of this work lies in the demonstration of a new operation strategy that utilises real-time occupancy monitoring and chilled-water storage tanks to improve the efficiency of solar-assisted air-conditioning systems, thereby reducing their electricity consumption. Adopting this strategy resulted in a large energy-saving potential. The results demonstrate that during one cooling period, it is possible to conserve approximately 42% of the total electrical energy consumed by the system prior to the adoption of this operation strategy.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2031915385"}}

Following a critical review of the policies, we present an overview of SOLS-diffusion trend in the past one and a half decades; the pattern of diffusion across states and financial assistance allotted for development and promotion of SOLS. We examine the adoption pattern at household level and factors that determine the same employing a multinomial logit model. Installation of SOLS witnessed a declining trend over the years. States exhibited considerable variation in the installation of the two SOLS and the funds allocated by the central government are not comparable to their respective energy poverty intensity. It is encouraging to note that more than half of the SOLS adopters find it an adequate source of energy. Improvement in the status and increase in the cost of alternative sources of energy adversely influence the household's choice of using SOLS as a complementary source of energy; improvement in the status of SOLS and increase in the financial strength of the household encourages them to adopt one.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2013318752"}}

The aim of the project is to develop integrated process inspection, cleaning, repair and control systems for thin films on flexible photo voltaic films based on CIGS (Copper Indium Gallium Selenide CuInxGa(1-x)Se2). Flexible PV films are fabricated on polymer film by the repeated deposition, and patterning, of thin layer materials using roll-to-roll processes, where the whole film is approximately 3um thick prior to final encapsulation. Take up of such devices, especially for building integrated applications BIPV, is hampered by long-term degradation of efficiency due to water ingress through the barrier layer defects to the CIGS modules causing electrical shorts and efficiency drops. To address this problem a thin (~40nm) barrier coating of Al2O3 usually provides the environmental protection for the PV cells. The highly conformal aluminium oxide barrier layer is produced by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The presentation reports initial measurement and characterisation of prototype films. Characterisation is based on the application of segmentation analysis and where the film is considered to be a special case structured surface and defects are considered as structural elements.

Rather than focus on the individual consumer\u2019s investment decision, over 20 scenarios were developed which explored key input parameters such as the maximum penetration level of rooftop solar installations, pricing of equipment, tax credits, and net-metering policy to determine what role rooftop solar plays in renewable energy investment at an aggregate level. The research finds that at lower levels of penetration, such as those currently found in the United States, other renewable energy sources remain viable options, thus rooftop solar should be just one option considered when increasing development of renewable energy sources.

The use of innovative technologies in order to improve performance and reduce energy costs is one of the most important requirements currently in refurbishment projects. This paper begins by outlining some requirements (functional, technical and aesthetical) that must be met for integrated devices, like building integrated photovoltaic panels (BIPV), within the context of current knowledge of historical roofing techniques. We then consider the area around the BIPV which has an increased possibility of water infiltration, locally and near the eaves. Different specimens, on 1:1 scale, were produced, at the Laboratory of the Department of Building Engineering and Territorial Systems (DISET)1 at the Politecnico di Torino, in order to improve current devices from a technical and aesthetical point of view, according to the critical aspects described, and to satisfy the requirement of the current legislation in Italy2. Finally, some wind driven rain experimental tests were carried out, in order to improve the local water resistancy of devices and some solutions are proposed.

This paper gives an outlook on the current and possible future situation of solar cooling in Europe. A competitive technology to solar thermal cooling is photovoltaic-based cooling using photovoltaic (PV) panels to generate electricity connected to a conventional air-conditioner. So far, this technology has been far too expensive due to the high cost for PV panels. Recent price drops of PV panels however have changed this and lead to the investigation presented in the following. Economics are discussed using a comparison of photovoltaic vapour-compression cooling against solar thermal cooling with an absorption chiller and a grid-connected reference chiller. A sensitivity analysis is presented including electricity price and PV panel cost. It was found that at current conditions (\u20ac0.12/kWhel) the PV-based cooling (PVS) has a lower cost than the solar thermal cooling system (STAC). The PVS system however has a higher cost than the REF system until the electricity price reaches \u20ac0.21/kWhel, then the PVS system has lower lifetime cost. Secondly, a solar thermal cooling system does not break even with a grid connected chiller until an electricity cost of \u20ac0.34/kWhel.

This paper aims at investigating if the balance between aesthetics and performance in building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems is possible to be achieved in the tropics. To accomplish this objective, three BIPV systems located in Singapore with photovoltaic (PV) systems playing an aesthetically appealing role in their architecture were analysed in detail for a 1-year period. The systems were analysed regarding the available solar irradiation, the shading profiles and the resulting yield and performance ratio (PR) in order to compare the performance of different subsystems with variable architectural characteristics and string configurations. All systems are partially shaded in the early morning or late afternoon, a common situation inherent to BIPV systems. Results show that even with a theoretical non-optimal combination of azimuthal deviations and tilt angles, some PV systems show better performances in terms of yield and PR than those which are installed at more ideal conditions. The high ratio of diffuse irradiation in Singapore, the distance of shading obstacles and times when shading occurs and the subsystem and string configurations strongly influence the systems performance results. With the declining costs of PV systems, BIPV can offer attractive solutions with high integration appeal, architectural sophistication and the promotion of sustainable energy supply. In the tropics, rooftop BIPV systems can perform with relatively small losses and be aesthetically appealing when compared with optimally tilted and oriented PV generators.

From the perspective of the user, this drain test is more effective than the stirring test. In this study, the thermal performance were compared through the drain test for a passive type and an active type domestic solar hot water systems consisting of the same storage tank and collectors. At this point, a passive type was used the horizontal storage tanks, and an active type was used vertical storage tank. In the drain test, when the hot water drained up to the reference hot water temperature, an active type which have vertical storage tank represents excellent daily performance than a passive type which have horizontal storage tank regardless of weather conditions. The reason for this is because the vertical storage tank is advantageous to thermal stratification in the tank. After the drain test, the residual heat for the horizontal storage tank was much more than the vertical storage tank, but in the next day the amount of discharged heat were less than the those of vertical storage tank neither.

In this context, this work aims at the development of a general methodology for designing PV systems based on ecodesign principles and taking into account simultaneously both techno-economic and environmental considerations. In order to evaluate the environmental performance of PV systems, an environmental assessment technique was used based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The environmental model was successfully coupled with the design stage model of a PV grid-connected system (PVGCS). The PVGCS design model was then developed involving the estimation of solar radiation received in a specific geographic location, the calculation of the annual energy generated from the solar radiation received, the characteristics of the different components and the evaluation of the techno-economic criteria through Energy PayBack Time (EPBT) and PayBack Time (PBT). The performance model was then embedded in an outer multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization loop based on a variant of NSGA-II. A set of Pareto solutions was generated representing the optimal trade-off between the objectives considered in the analysis. A multi-variable statistical method (i.e., Principal Componet Analysis, PCA) was then applied to detect and omit redundant objectives that could be left out of the analysis without disturbing the main features of the solution space. Finally, a decision-making tool based on M-TOPSIS was used to select the alternative that provided a better compromise among all the objective functions that have been investigated. The results showed that while the PV modules based on c-Si have a better performance in energy generation, the environmental aspect is what makes them fall to the last positions. TF PV modules present the best trade-off in all scenarios under consideration.

Large-scale deployment of solar technologies in rooftops of densely populated cities may have the potential of modifying surface energy budgets resulting in cooling or heating of the urban environment. To investigate this case, a mesoscale simulation (regional atmospheric simulation system (RAMS)) effort was undertaken, with a horizontal grid resolution of 4 km on an innermost grid over Southern California (South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB)).

With buildings accounting for 40% of primary energy requirements in EU and the implementation of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), developing effective energy alternatives for buildings is imperative. The increasing role for renewables implies that solar thermal systems (STSs) and photovoltaics (PVs) will have a main role as they contribute directly to the heating and cooling of buildings and the provision of electricity and domestic hot water. Meeting building electrical and thermal loads will be primarily achieved through an extensive use of renewables, following standard building energy saving measures, such as good insulation or advanced glazing systems. These systems are typically mounted on building roofs with no attempt to incorporate them into the building envelope creating aesthetic challenges, space availability issues and envelope integrity problems. This paper aims to give a survey of possible solutions of PV and STS integration on the building roofs and fa\u00e7ades.

Building-integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPV) are able to improve the energy balance of buildings. However, this improvement can be analyzed quantitatively only if the electricity yield generated by the BIPV system is calculated. This PhD thesis presents a simulation program that calculates the electricity yield generated by BIPV systems, including those made of geometrically complex BIPV modules. The simulation is based on a combination of a ray-tracing procedure with the resultant I-V curves of electrically connected PV cells. For the annual electricity yield, multi-core cluster computers are applied to perform the simulation on the basis of 5-minute meteorological data throughout a year. The ray-tracing technique is applied to calculate inhomogeneous irradiation, the consequence of shading or reflections from surrounding objects, and the quantitative relevance of reflections from the ground. The temperatures of the PV cells are calculated by taking the physical principles of heat conduction, heat convection and thermal radiation into account. The cell I-V curves are calculated depending on the temperature and the irradiance. After the virtual interconnection of the PV cells in the simulation, the effect of inverter efficiency and its dependence on the generator voltage are calculated, finally leading to the AC power of the BIPV system. All parts of the simulation are validated by comparison with measurements, and the accuracy of the simulation is quantified with the help of statistical measures. Finally, the simulation program is applied to calculate the electricity yield generated by two BIPV systems.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W76684884"}}

This study aims to investigate advantages of complex installation of green roof and PV system in a public building, to analyze the impact of green roof on the efficiency of PV power generation, and to consider the correlation between green roof and PV power generation. When the temperature and power generation of the modules installed in the green roof and non-green roof of the public building were measured for 3 days, the average temperature of the green roof was 23.6 degrees, and it was 36.1 degrees in the non-green roof which increased by nearly 53%. Overall, the module temperature in the green roof was lower. On the other hand, in relation to the PV generation depending on temperature reduction during the same period, the mono-crystalline module and the poly-crystalline module in the green roof showed an increase in generation at nearly 222.2W and 341.6W, and the efficiency rose by 5.5% and 6.2%, respectively, compared to the modules in the non-green roof.

On the one hand, photovoltaic is one of the areas of energy industry, which belongs to a sector of the renewable sources. On the other hand, it is a realm of technology of the photoelectric devices, which are based on the physics of semiconductors. In this article the convertors of the solar radiation into electricity \u2013 so-called solar cells - are discussed. The important key of functioning of the solar cells is a photoeffect, a physical phenomenon of the direct transformation of the sunlight into electric current. The semiconductor  p-n junction governs the process of the appearance of the photovoltage. The operation principles and manufacturing structures of various solar cells and their applications are considered. The topic is provided on the introductory level without going deeply into details of the photovoltaic research and condensed matter physics. Many aspects of solar batteries are explained rather qualitatively, that would be interesting also for students and scientists of non-physics education.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2950419233"}}

Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) have the ability to receive light from a wide range of angles, concentrating the captured light onto small photo active areas. This enables greater incorporation of LSCs into building designs as windows, skylights and wall claddings in addition to rooftop installations of current solar panels. Using relatively cheap luminescent dyes and acrylic waveguides to effect light concentration onto lesser photovoltaic (PV) cells, there is potential for this technology to approach grid price parity. We employ a panel design in which the front facing PV cells collect both direct and concentrated light ensuring a gain factor greater than one. This also allows for flexibility in determining the placement and percentage coverage of PV cells during the design process to balance reabsorption losses against the power output and level of light concentration desired. To aid in design optimization, a Monte-Carlo ray tracing program was developed to study the transport of photons and loss mechanisms in LSC panels. The program imports measured absorption/emission spectra and transmission coefficients as simulation parameters with interactions of photons in the panel determined by comparing calculated probabilities with random number generators. LSC panels with multiple dyes or layers can also be simulated. Analysis of the results reveals optimal panel dimensions and PV cell layouts for maximum power output for a given dye concentration, absorbtion/emission spectrum and quantum efficiency.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2059471138"}}

Historic buildings, located in inner cities can also have room for some energy improvements, even across compliance with some modern standards and new construction techniques without damaging their main valuable architectural features. However, to meet these energy requirements it is necessary to promote the use of solar energy also on existing buildings, with or without particular historical values.

Measurements over a one year study period from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012 from a large field project in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania were used to determine the differences in power output from green and black roofs as well as to derive two regression functions for back-surface panel temperature and photovoltaic (PV) output. These estimation functions were applied to three different cities (San Diego, CA; Huntsville, AL; and Phoenix, AZ) chosen to represent a wide range of irradiance and temperature values. Based on the specific test-bed configuration, the green or black roof choice under the PV panels had little impact on the PV performance. The difference in magnitude of power generation for green roof\u2013PV compared with black roof\u2013PV assemblies was small (0.5%) corresponding to an annual loss of $9/60 panels in Pittsburgh and a benefit of approximately $8/60 panels per year in Phoenix.

Shifting to renewable sources of electricity is imperative in achieving global reductions in carbon emissions and ensuring future energy security. One technology, solar photovoltaics (PV), has begun to generate a noticeable contribution to the electricity mix in numerous countries. However, the upper limits of this contribution have not been explored in a way that combines both building-by-building solar resource appraisals with the city-scale socio-economic contexts that dictate PV uptake. This paper presents such a method, whereby a \u2018Solar City Indicator\u2019 is calculated and used to rank cities by their capacity to generate electricity from roof-mounted PV. Seven major UK cities were chosen for analysis based on available data; Dundee, Derby, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield. The physical capacity of each city was established using a GIS-based methodology, exploiting digital surface models and LiDAR data, with distinct methodologies for large and small properties. Socio-economic factors (income, education, environmental consciousness, building stock and ownership) were chosen based on existing literature and correlation with current levels of PV installations. These factors were enumerated using data that was readily available across each city. Results show that Derby has the greatest potential of all the cities analysed, as it offers both good physical and socio-economic potential. In terms of physical capacity it was seen that over a 15 year payback period there are two plateaus, showing a marked difference in viability between small and large PV arrays. It was found that both the physical and socio-economic potential of a city are strongly influenced by the nature of the local building stock. This study also identifies areas where policy needs to be focused in order to encourage uptake and highlights factors limiting maximum PV uptake.

Additionally, a variable speed drive is coupled with the condenser fan to control the air flow rate and synchronized with the inline valve closing and opening. For the control purpose, a lumped parameter model is first developed to describe the system dynamics in an explicit input-output relationship; then, a linear optimal control scheme is applied for the system's multivariable control.

This thesis work focuses on the effect of shading on the photovoltaic (PV) modules in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). The main objective of this thesis work is to analyse and characterise the electrical and thermal behaviour of the PV modules when they are partially shaded, a circumstance which frequently occurs in photovoltaic installations in buildings. The PV module technologies considered in this research are; Cadmium Telluride (CdTe), Copper Indium Selenide (CIS), amorphous silicon heterojunction, amorphous silicon simple junction, amorphous silicon triple junction, mono-crystalline silicon (Kyocera), mono-crystalline silicon (Suntech), mono-crystalline silicon back contacts and multi-crystalline silicon (Si-mc). The electrical and thermal measurements were done in outdoor conditions to obtain data in real operating conditions. Each PV module technology was exposed to different shadow patterns and the I-V curves measured. In order to correct the measured I-V curves to the same testing conditions, the IEC 60904-1 standard was considered, in which it is necessary to know the values of the temperature coefficients, internal series resistance (Rs) and curve correction factor (k). The shadow patterns resulted into the reduction of the electrical characteristics (current, voltage and power) for each module technology. The shading also resulted into the reduction of the maximum power of each module technology and there were no hot spots in the modules. The magnitude of the electrical parameters of the PV module technologies due to shading depends on the shadow patterns, arrangement of the cells and location of bypass diodes in the modules. The thermal characterisation indicates that shading resulted into the reduction of the module temperatures in comparison to the unshaded module and there were no hot spots in all the module technologies. Therefore, all the module technologies tested are capable of being applied in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) since they are not affected by hot spot phenomena in the real operating conditions. The comparison of the different PV module technologies with the same shadow patterns indicates that the PV modules perform differently with shading. The results indicate that some PV module technologies which perform well in one shadow type do not perform well in another shadow type. In the application of BIPV in buildings, shading should be taken as a priority since it greatly affects the electrical and thermal characteristics of the modules. The nature of the shadows in a location should be considered before selecting the PV module technologies to apply in the BIPV system.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W16326223"}}

From the point of view of road transport, hydrogen is a clean energy source that is more efficient than other fossil fuels used to date. However, its use in this field is still limited, not only because of technical and economic limitations of the vehicle itself but also due to the need for large hydrogen refuelling stations. For that reason, the primary objective of this paper is to present the design and performance of a residential hydrogen fuelling station based on water electrolysis.

Development of a New Energy-Efficient Hybrid Solar-Assisted Air Conditioning System V. Vakiloroaya, R. Ismail, Q.P. Ha Pages 54-65 (2013 Proceedings of the 30th ISARC, Montr\u00e9al, Canada, ISBN 978-1-62993-294-1, ISSN 2413-5844) Abstract: The paper aims at developing a hybrid solar-assisted air conditioner system for performance enhancement and energy efficiency improvement. To increase sub-cooling of the refrigerant at partial loads, we propose a new discharge bypass line together with an inline solenoid valve, installed after the compressor to regulate the mass flow rate of the refrigerant vapour passing through a hot water storage tank. For control design, a lumped parameter model is first developed to describe the dynamics of the system in an explicit form of input-output relationship. The system has been fully-instrumented to examine its performance under different operation conditions. The system model is then validated by extensive experimental tests. The predictions from the models exhibit a good coincidence with experimental results, judging by an RMS error less than 15%. Based on the obtained dynamic model, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is applied to optimize a cost function of the output errors and control efforts. The key challenge is to regulate the refrigerant temperature entering the condenser by controlling the valve opening. The design approach is then tested in a transient simulation tool to predict the system performance in transient conditions. The experimental results obtained from implementation with PLC demonstrate that the proposed system delivers higher system efficiency owing to the higher refrigeration effect in the direct expansion evaporator. Thus, the novel development is promising for improvement of energy efficiency, enhancement of the system performance while fulfilling the cooling demand. Consequently, between 25 and 43% of monthly electricity can be saved on average.

Grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system efficiency can be maximized with building demand matching. Computer simulations were used to investigate the priorities of energy efficient measures commonly used in residential and commercial buildings in Thailand that decreased the electricity demand while producing load profiles that matched the unique output profiles from PV systems. Residential and commercial buildings in Thailand were modeled in existing conditions. Then they were made compliant with ASHRAE energy standard requirements which can reduce electricity consumption 16-36% in residential buildings and 8-19% in commercial buildings. With energy efficient design measures, electricity production from PV systems could satisfy the remaining consumption and peak electricity demand reduction could reach up to 70% in residential buildings. Electricity consumption and peak demand reduction in commercial buildings was not high. Reducing lighting power density in residential buildings, using higher glazing efficiency in small offices and using thermal mass in big offices were found to be able to reduce more peak load when electricity output from PV systems were incorporated in the buildings compared with other measures.

At the moment, the widespread use of renewable energy in buildings is limited by its intrinsic discontinuity: consequently integration of plants with energy storage systems could represent an efficient solution to the problem. Within this frame, hydrogen has shown to be particularly fit in order to be used as an energetic carrier. In this aim, in the paper an energetic, economic and environmental analysis of two different configurations of a self-sufficient system for energy production from renewable sources in buildings is presented. In particular, in the first configuration energy production is carried out by means of photovoltaic systems, whereas in the second one a combination of photovoltaic panels and wind generators is used. In both configurations, hydrogen is used as an energy carrier, in order to store energy, and fuel cells guarantee its energetic reconversion. The analysis carried out shows that, although dimensioned as a stand-alone configuration, the system can today be realized only taking advantage from the incentivizing fares applied to grid-connected systems, that are likely to be suspended in the next future. In such case, it represents an interesting investment, with capital returns in about 15 years. As concerns economic sustainability, in fact, the analysis shows that the cost of the energy unit stored in hydrogen volumes, due to the not very high efficiency of the process, presently results greater than that of directly used one. Moreover, also the starting fund of the system proves to be very high, showing an additional cost with respect to systems lacking of energy storage equal to about 50%. From the above, it can be deduced that, in the aim to obtain a quick, effective penetration of hydrogen into the market, it is at the moment indispensable to enact incentivizing policies, attributing to hydrogen production fares able to cover the additional costs due to its production, storage and reconversion.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2032226574"}}

Four types of CSP plants with parabolic troughs were simulated at two sites, Bom Jesus da Lapa and Campo Grande, and PV plants were simulated at two other sites, Recife and Rio de Janeiro. The main parameters obtained for each plant were expanded to other suitable sites in the country (totaling 17.2 GW in 2040), as inputs in an optimization model for evaluating the impacts of the introduction of centralized solar power on the expansion of the electricity grid up to 2040. This scenario would be about USD$ 185 billion more expensive than a business as usual scenario, where expansion solely relies on least-cost options. Hence, for the country to incentivize the expansion of centralized solar power, specific auctions for solar energy should be adopted, as well as complementary policies to promote investments in R&D and the use of hybrid systems based on solar and fuels in CSP plants.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2091945637"}}

This paper presents an energy system that utilizes solar energy to produce air conditioning with an absorption refrigeration system. Since there is often a temporal variance between the availability of the required solar energy and the demand for commercial building air conditioning, a liquid natural gas (LNG) subsystem is often used to supplement the solar-thermal array system. Because of operating cost consideration, this paper proposes the use of a R-123 heat pump to supply the required additional heat and temperature needed to effectively operate the absorption air conditioning system. Waste heat from the absorption system water condenser is used by the R-123 heat pump subsystem evaporator to supply the additional required heat at the appropriate temperature to the absorption system generator using the R-123 heat pump subsystem condenser. Under conditions when the pricing ratio of electric power and LNG is at certain level or when LNG is not available, the proposed R-123 heat pump subsystem offers a cost effective option. The solar-thermal collector array and R-123 heat pump are in a series just before the generator of the absorption system. The temperature differential between the absorption system water condenser temperature and the required absorption system generator temperature is relatively moderate, so that the coefficient of performance of the R-123 heat pump subsystem is sufficiently high to be a competitive alternative when compared to a LNG assist subsystem. Because of this moderate temperature difference, the proposed R-123 heat pump assist subsystem appears to be a better choice under certain conditions, than the use of LNG to raise the solar-thermal array transport fluid temperature to the required generator temperature when the solar-thermal array system fails to do so.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1981548719"}}

This paper assesses the technical and economic performance of PV technology integrated into residential buildings in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. It highlights the value of PV electricity for the GCC society from the perspective of consumers, utilities and environment. Through a systematic modelling analysis it is shown that the efficiency of PV system drops by 4\u20136% due to high range of module temperature and also a change in power output due to high ambient temperatures. Consequently, the outputs of horizontal and vertical PV modules are found to be less than estimates based on standard test conditions. Economically, this study shows that building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems are not viable in GCC countries and cannot compete with conventional electricity sources on a unit cost basis. From a society point of view, however, the integration of PV technology into buildings would have several benefits for the GCC countries, including: first, savings in capital cost due to central power plants and transmission and distribution processes; second, an increase in the exported oil and natural gas used for electricity generation; and third, a reduction in the CO2 emissions from conventional power plants.

Abstract. This paper presents the analysis of solar energy & electricity generation system from solar energy in Bangladesh. The solar energy can optimize the present electricity shortage in the country. Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity. The sunlight is incident on the solar panels and then the electric current continues to flow. This energy is stored into charging battery with the help of charge controller. The DC power comes from the battery is converted into AC power with the help of Inverter circuit. Finally, the AC output power is delivered to the Load. The system described by this paper is essential to neutralize the current Load-shedding problem in Bangladesh & ensure the continuity of supply among peoples.Keywords: Bangladesh, Electricity generation. Load Shedding, Solar energy. Renewable energy1. INTRODUCTIONEnergy is the part and parcel of our life. Life is unimaginable without energy [1] [2] [15], There will be no life after the extinction of energy. We make good use of energy. It is everywhere around us and in us. There is not only one type of energy. There is heat, electricity, light. Energy is stored in our bodies. The energy present in the molecules of carbohydrates, proteins and other substances enable us to breathe, move, grow, think, speak and live. In working, playing and doing anything even sleeping need energy.Human beings are living on this planet from billions of years. They have suffered to make their lives easier. The humankind has invented millions of appliances and machines to make the lifetime easier and comforting. Some of these machines make use of electricity to fulfill our needs where others use fuel to fulfill the task. Heat and electricity are the most common forms of energy. The moving particles in any substance generate heat. The warmth depends on the movement of the particles. The movement of electrons in a conductor like copper electric wire creates electricity. Besides heat and electricity there are also a number of other energies that we are making use of. Energy can be divided in two basic types [3] :> RENEWABLE ENERGIES> NON-RENEWABLE ENERGIESThe non-renewable forms of energy are the one who exhaust on exploitation, for example natural gas, oil, radioactive elements, coal, etc. the renewable energy is replaceable. The supply is never ending. The energy is extracted from the natural sources in natural manner without spoiling the natural flow. The renewable energy comes from the sun rays, water, wind and many other natural resources. By the virtue of collectors, designed for the purpose, we can store energy from these resources and utilize them for our specific purpose. Such supply of energy will continue to serve us unless or until water (oceans) is flowing, sun is blazing, wind is blowing and trees are growing.Sun is providing us with extensive amount of energy from the very first day of its dawn. Sun provides us with heat, light. X-ray and radio waves [4] [5], There are collectors and modules to collect the sun energy and to convert it into different usable forms of energies. Solar energy is a brilliant source of most popular forms of energies that is heat and electricity. For remote use of energy, solar power is getting popularity like agriculture applications such as pasture management and irrigation, tropical states that are detached from electricity grid, for heating swimming pools, telecommunication towers and much more.The sun light casting upon water and earth cause the air to move above at getting warm, that gives wind which has been one of the best sources of energy from ages [6], Initially wind was used for carrying ships, grinding grains, pumping water and much more. Today wind is one of the cleanest and renewable sources of energy [7], Biomass is composed of different forms of energy. Biomass refers to straw, wood, biological waste products, etc. in energy industry as they contain abundant energy. \u2026", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W191703886"}}

Simulation and Optimization of a Solar Driven Air Conditioning System for Indian Cities Conventional air-conditioners need high grade energy i.e. electricity, which in India, is primarily produced from fossil fuels. In spite of several emission restraints exercised by many countries under Kyoto protocol, energy consumption and pollution levels are higher than ever. Therefore, an assessment from the ecological point of view needs to be implemented as the greenhouse gases effect remains a threat to the environment. India is a booming economy with not enough installed power to supply the growing demand. This shortage of electricity results in frequent power cuts, even in the metropolitan cities. In summers, the cooling load of buildings increases due to high ambient temperature. It is during the same time that available solar is at its peak. These are some of the motivations behind usage of solar energy for air conditioning of buildings. Solar cooling technology provides an important contribution to both economical and ecological energy supply. The aim of this study was to simulate and optimize a solar based absorption system for Indian conditions. Four cities were selected such that they have different incident solar radiation and climatic region. Since Meteonorm data files are not available for all locations, the availability of city\u2019s data file was also considered during selection. Meteonorm files are used to simulate the ambient conditions for a location in TRNSYS simulations. Energistic SunTrac27 was selected as the solar collector for this study based on efficiency comparisons. Standard configuration for the building and comfort conditions was setup based on ASHRAE standards. The cooling loads were estimated with the standard configuration for selected cities. The parametric analysis was conducted to study the impact each of infiltration, ventilation, comfort conditions, heat gains, and other simulation conditions on the cooling load. It was observed that the months which have highest ambient temperature for the selected cities also happen to be the ones with the highest cooling loads. This was because even if solar radiation was not the only parameter affecting the cooling load, it was certainly the only variable for an office premises where other parameters are fixed, like number of people, working hours, lighting, usage of appliances etc. The cooling loads were simulated hourly and saved in an output file. This file was used for simulating the load component in the TRNSYS model of solar absorption cycle. Solar based absorption cycle was simulated using TRNSYS.

HVAC systems are the most energy consuming devices among building components. Therefore, to achieve the global aims in energy reduction, the efficiency of HVAC systems has to improve significantly. Thermally driven air conditioning systems are a possible way to reduce the dependency on traditional vapor compression cycles and to lower the primary energy consumption. Due to the separation of dehumidification and cooling, natural heat sources, e.g. solar thermal energy, and natural heat sinks, e.g. shallow geothermal energy, can be used or, when combined with a traditional vapor compression cycle, the temperature level of the heat sink can be increased. With the separation of cooling and ventilation the overall efficiency can be increased even more. This paper introduces a pilot installation of a solar thermal and geothermal assisted air conditioning system located in Hamburg, Germany. The combination of a desiccant assisted air conditioning system with radiant heat exchanger enables a highly efficient HVAC system. Due to the strong influence of outdoor air conditions, a system model is built to evaluate the performance of this system at different climate conditions worldwide.

Multi-crystalline silicon solar cells is not exist a specific crystal direction different from single crystalline silicon solar cells. In functional materials, therefore, isotropic wet etching of mc-Si solar cell is easy the acid solution rather than the alkaline solution. The reflectance of wet texturing process is about 25% and the reflectance of RIE texturing process is achieved less than 10%. In addition, wet texturing has many disadvantages as well as reflectance. So wet texturing process has been replaced by a RIE texturing process. In order to apply BIPV, RIE and wet textured multi-crystalline silicon solar cell modules was manufactured by different kind of EVA sheet. Moreover, in case of BIPV, the short circuit current characteristics according to the angle of incidence is more important, because the installation of BIPV is fixed location.

Keywords:Solar energy, Floor Heating, TRNSYS, Cyprus. ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in using solar energy in the underfloor heating systems. However, the large areas required for the placing of the solar collectors can be discouraging, especially for the apartment buildings. The objective of this study is to investigate the possibility of using Compound Parabolic Collector (CPC) collectors to replace Flat-Plat collectors in solar energy underfloor heating systems. By this way, it is aimed to explore the feasibility of area reduction required by the collectors. Secondly, the temperature profiles of the circulating water loops and the concrete slabs are sought to be examined. The simulations were carried out under the winter weather conditions of the Cyprus. The system consists of solar thermal collectors, a storage tank and circulation of water to carry the heat to 4 floor slabs. The results of the simulations show that, a CPC collector which is commonly used in producing high grade heat can work more effectively with less area occupied in this system. It is observed from this study that the outlet fluid temperature of this collector is between 25 to 95\u25e6C, compared to that of Flat-Plate collectors which is between 25 and 75\u25e6C. The simulations suggest that a 2 m2 CPC collector can perform satisfactorily to match the job of 8 m2 Flat-Plate collectors. The heat that is stored in the tank can supply hot water at a temperature of 60\u25e6C which is reduced to 45\u25e6C after mixing with cold return water before entering the floor slabs. The estimated slab temperature is approximately 24\u25e6C which is compatible with the standards. Fluid which is passing through the slabs will eventually lose its temperature as the heat transfer occurs from the slabs to the environment. Consequently the fluid outlet temperature is observed to be approximately 25\u25e6C.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1951489726"}}

The energy economic analysis of the standard rural house model with PV system was performed based on annual energy demand calculation using the EnergyPlus to contribute in reducing building energy which occupies 25% of national energy consumption and in developing a low-energy & eco-friendly house model. Two types of PV system installation was considered to cover electricity demand for cooling, electric, and heating devices. For the selected house model, heating energy demand is 7 times higher than cooling energy demand. For the Case1, it is favorable to use electricity from PV system for cooling and electric devices and to sell surplus electricity. For the Case2, it is favorable to use electricity from PV system for cooling, electricity and heating devices and to sell surplus electricity. Considering the installation cost of PV system and heat pump air conditioning system, the break-even point of Case1 and Case2 are about 13 and 11 years respectively. Although the installation cost of Case2 is more expensive, Case2 provides three times more profit than Case1 after the break-even point. Because the expected average life time of the selected PV system is 25 years, Case2 is more favorable option for the given standard rural house model.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2005396053"}}

The BPC development is the first in the US to mandate, through the 2000 Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) guidelines, the use of PV as a renewable energy generation system in its individual buildings. The scope of this study is to show how PV is integrated in the BPC buildings\u2019 design process, and what can be learned for future PV applications. The study draws directly from the design decision making sources, investigating on the concerns and suggestions of the BPCA director of sustainability and the BPC architects and PV installers. It attempts to contrast a theoretical approach that sees PV as a technology to domesticate in architecture and bring, through grounded research, PV industry closer to the architectural design process. The findings of the study suggest that while stringent environmental mandates help, in the short term, to kick-start the use of PV systems in buildings, it is the recognition of the PV\u2019s primary role as energy provider, its assimilation in the building industry, and its use in a less confining building program that allows for its evolution in architecture.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2109948869"}}

The prototype key concepts, identified according to the recommendations of the IEA Task 41 research project, are: multi-functionality, prefabrication, sustainability and integration. The prototype design is the result of a theoretical study which takes into account both architectural integration aspects and energy performance issues. The latter in particular, is based on the evaluation and improvement of both PV and building-related aspects, through the investigation and implementation of low-cost passive strategies to improve the overall BiPV performance. A modular specimen of the prototype was built thanks to an industrial collaboration and tested through an experimental approach, based on the combination of several phases performed in two test facilities (i.e. INTENT lab and SoLaRE-PV lab) by means of original experimental set-up. The effectiveness of the proposed BiPV prototype configuration is proven by comparing the results of the experiments with monitored data of two BiPV systems (a roof and a facade system) located in South Tyrol (North of Italy). The experimental results are then generalized, providing significant data and experimental expressions for a deeper understanding of BiPV systems energy performance.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W155480744"}}

Analysis by year, capacity, subject organization, facility categorization of BIPV system and size, output by unit area of BIPV module was analyzed. The analyzed results are as follows. (1) BIPV system was installed in 71 locations of 2.7MW from 2007 to 2012 and frequency by BIPV system installation capacity range was highest in 10kW\u223c20kW with 31%. Also, it was most applied in public work facilities with 33.8% and next was education\u00b7society educational institutes with 26.8%. (2) BIPV module was most installed in building facades instead of curtain walls in which form was G-to-G double-glaing type and G-to-T type with proportion of 38% each. (3) BIPV module size was all under 2\u33a1 and most size was 1.0\u223c1.5\u33a1. This size is scarce to replace building material with BIPV module.

It is essential to know the climatic characteristics of the site for energy efficient building design. However, it is difficult to obtain a climate data through the new energy system device. Even if the new data is obtained, it is difficult to apply to the building. Because it is usually consisted of just series of efficiency. In the meaning, a solar air heating has low efficiency compared with the solar water heating because of the smaller thermal capacity. The heat received by solar air-water combined system plate is not fully transferred to the air and then a part of them became the losses to the environment through conduction and convection process. This research is focusing on the investigation of efficiency of better combined multi-purposed system suggested by us and aims to secure the more effective solar energy utilization by combining the hot water and air heating system.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2202828069"}}

Abstract \u2014 Space-conditioning is a dominating energy-consuming service. The demand for heating/cooling/(de)humidification of indoor air is growing with increasing comfort expectations and cooling loads, due to global warming and buildings being designed to squeeze in maximum possible per unit area, owing to space constraints, especially in urban areas, which earlier grew horizontally and now, vertically. Conventional space-conditioning technologies exhibit several clear disadvantages including high energy consumption and electricity peak loads during operation and several negative environmental impacts, as they employ refrigerants. Thus, there is an increasing awareness around the world regarding energy-efficient, environment-friendly space-conditioning systems. The most common economic approach to space-conditioning in buildings is to keep it simplest possible, using locally and easily available materials and technology and leaving nature to do the rest. Various alternative methods of space conditioning have been / are being explored to develop energy-efficient, environment-friendly space-conditioning systems. Three main categories of Non-Conventional Space-Conditioning Systems can be identified as Solar-assisted air-conditioning systems, Earth Tube Heat Exchanger (ETHE) / Buried Tube Heat Exchanger (BPHE) based Space-Conditioning Systems and Other non-conventional space-conditioning systems. There can be varieties in each type depending upon the geographic and climatic conditions for which they are developed, the specific requirements of the system like, work-place, residential building, greenhouse, auditorium, etc. as well as principle on which they work and technology they make use of. This paper aims at studying recent trends in non-conventional space-conditioning systems, their role in energy conservation and their importance in the context of environmental hazards imposed by the conventional systems.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1519864170"}}

The system analysis was taken on a 200 MW coal-fired power plant hybridized with solar heat at approximately 300 \u00b0C, where the middle-temperature solar thermal energy was used to preheat the feed water before entering the boiler. With changing solar radiation in typical days, the solar share, the work output and the net solar-to-electricity efficiency of this solar hybrid system were evaluated. The net solar-to-electricity efficiency would be increased by 3\u20137% points compared to that in a solar-only power plant. An off-design parallel configuration of this hybrid system was proposed, achieving the net annual solar-to-electricity efficiency of 18%. It would expected to be an attractive approach to develop the scale-up mid-temperature solar thermal power technology in the short and midterm.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2091035299"}}

Building integrated photovoltaics, a special form of photovoltaics, is still a niche market with a relatively low number of installations worldwide. Although it is considered a promising technology, especially in Europe where land for large-scale photovoltaic plants is rare, several factors continue to constrain its widespread adoption. This paper investigates the prospects for, and barriers to, building integrated photovoltaics adoption in the European context, building on a series of interviews with experts in the field. The results indicate that the main problems relate to cost calcu lations, to the existing gap between the photovoltaic and the building industry, and to the lack of expertise and knowledge concerning the potential of the technology among important stakeholders.

Abstract World over, sustainability and carbon emissions are two major growing concerns. Energy efficiency and larger proportion of renewable energy integration are treated as two of the solutions for electricity sector by governments, utilities as well as large end users. Many different small-scale renewable generation technologies are being developed and tested for grid performance motivated by reducing transmission and distribution loss, reducing peak demand, maintaining security of supply, and a possible reduction in electricity charges [1] . It is foreseen that once small scale renewable generation cells become economically competitive, the growth of them in existing electricity networks could be dramatic. Many of the existing small scale renewable generation technologies rely on electronic inverter switching [2] , [3] , [4] at the integration point. Currently, due to the switching characteristics of inverters power quality could become a problem for end users and also impact on regulatory limits for distribution line utilities. The existing inverter technology application of micro wind turbine and solar photovoltaic cells is being currently deployed and assessed several distribution network utilities like Vector in New Zealand. In this paper the outcome of these trials are analysed in addition to proposing the modelling framework to quantify the power quality effect of small scale renewable generation cells. A practical and comprehensive way to assess the power quality impacts due to large scale integration of these new renewable generation devices is also presented.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a newly developed flat plate integrated solar collector system. The developed collector system consists of a low-temperature flat plate collector integrated within a concrete building envelope. To evaluate this system, a full-scale test prototype of the solar collector was constructed and instrumented with thermocouples. Measurements were conducted over a 7-month period in which the solar collector was evaluated over different climatic conditions. On the basis of the results of the experimental program, it was determined that the solar collector provided an efficiency ranging from 49\u201375% in the range of ambient temperature, solar radiation, and inlet temperature evaluated in this experiment.

No glazing on the top of the solar concrete collector or insulation at the back was used as in conventional solar water heaters. To compare the energy saving. Two test rooms of 2.3 m width, 2.5 m length and 2.5 m height were built.

The experimental results showed that the solar concrete collector is extremely interesting as it can produce hot water up to 40 liters per day, water temperature was 40-50oC. The average room temperature was about 2oC lower than the conventional room. No effect of seasons (summer and winter), because of the solar intensities of both seasons were similar.

As a Solar America City, Houston teamed with the Houston Advanced Research Center (HARC), Sandia National Laboratory (Sandia), industry, and academia, to implement the Solar Houston Initiative and prepare the Solar Houston Plan. The Solar Houston initiative was focused on identifying and overcoming barriers associated with establishing a solar infrastructure that is incorporated into the City of Houston\u2019s overall energy plan. A broad group of Houston area stakeholders, facilitated by HARC, came together to develop a comprehensive solar plan that went beyond technology to address barriers and establish demonstrations, public outreach, education programs and other activities. The plan included proposed scopes of work in four program areas: policies, solar integration, public outreach, and education. Through the support of the DOE SunShot Rooftop Solar Challenge (RSC) grant to the Texas Collaboration (San Antonio, Austin, and Hosuton), Houston has been able to implement several of the recommendations of the Solar Houston Plan. Specific recommendations that this project was able to support include; Working with the other Texas Solar America Cities (San Antonio and Austin), to harmonize permitting and inspection processes to simplify for installers and lower soft costs of installation; Participating in state level solar policy groups such as the Texas Renewable Energy Industries Association (TRIEA); Continued coordination with the local transmission and distribution utility (CenterPoint) and retail electric providers (REP); Identification of opportunities to improve permitting and interconnection; Providing training on PV systems to City inspectors; Educating the public by continuing outreach, training, and workshops, particularly using the the Green Building Resources Center; Evaluating methods of addressing financial barriers to residential solar; Maintaining www.solarhoustontx.org; and Continuing meetings with stakeholders to get ongoing feedback from the solar community on their needs.

Australia has a very sunny climate, with a very high demand for air conditioning. Implementing solar assisted air conditioning is an ideal option to achieve a high solar fraction which leads to a significant amount of energy and greenhouse gas emission savings. Solar assisted air conditioning systems are environmentally friendly by being constructed in a way that minimises the need for chlorofluorocarbons CFC, Hydro chlorofluorocarbons HCFC or Chlorofluorocarbons HFC refrigerants and by using a low grade thermal renewable energy, therefore, making them energy efficient and environmentally safe. They can be used either as stand-alone systems or with conventional AC, to improve the indoor air quality. Solar cooling is a new and a fast growing technology compared to other fields of solar energy applications. On the other hand most of the current solar cooling applications are demonstration projects in nature; the technologies are advancing yet still need a lot of additional design, planning, development, and research efforts. T now solar assisted air conditioning's main obstacles are the high installation costs, and the lack of knowledge and familiarity with this technology between designers, developers and architects.

Photovoltaics are solar energy devices suitable for applications in both central power generation units (solar farms) and in separate units (residential and other buildings). In both cases, the aim is to install the photovoltaic modules with optimum tilt and azimuth angle, so that the electrical output is maximized. However, there are times where the photovoltaic modules cannot be placed with optimum angles and special considerations must be done in order to achieve a satisfactory result. In such cases, besides the increased cost, there are other things that need to be considered, such as the selection of a suitable type of photovoltaic module, the functional and aesthetic particularities of the installation in combination with the energy and environmental implications. The aim of this thesis is to study new ways of installing photovoltaics, by examining the parameters that affect their energy behavior, depending on the type of pv module and the way they are installed, the operating temperature conditions, the wind, the lighting and the specific requirements of the installation, in order to meet the electrical needs. A particular reference is made at the consequences of satisfying the aesthetic requirements of pv installations, seeking the optimal solution between functional and aesthetic application. In this thesis, experiments are conducted in natural conditions in order to determine the effects of the sunlight contribution of diffuse and specular reflectors at the energy efficiency of photovoltaics, the heat dissipation with water or air, the installation of pv modules with an unfavorable inclination and azimuth angle, the use of transparent pv modules, etc. Furthermore, several types of pv modules are tested (silicon, CIS, thin film, organic, rigid, flexible, etc.) and suggestions are made for special applications.

The authors believe that after this painful cleansing of the market, a massive counter trend will follow, enlivened and carried forward by more advanced PV technologies and ever-stricter climate policies designed to achieve energy neutrality in a cost-effective way. As a result, the need for BIPV products for use in construction will undergo first a gradual and then a massive increase.

In this study we assess the effects of installing a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) roof on an office building in Yuma, AZ. The system consists of thin film PV laminated to a white membrane, which lies above a layer of insulation. The solar absorptance of the roof decreased to 0.38 from 0.75 after installation of the BIPV, lowering summertime daily mean roof upper surface temperatures by about 5 \u00b0C. Summertime daily heat influx through the roof deck fell to \u00b10.1 kWh/m2 from 0.3\u20131.0 kWh/m2. However, summertime daily heat flux from the ventilated attic into the conditioned space was minimally affected by the BIPV, suggesting that the roof was decoupled from the conditioned space. Daily PV energy production was about 25% of building electrical energy use in the summer.

Units are heavy and prone to breakdown and installation is difficult. In the present study, one-axis three-position (1A-3P) low- cost sun tracking PV as a BIPV was developed and tested. The comparative test of a 1A-3P tracking PV system started from 2010/3/01 was carried out. The single-day increase of energy generation is 39% in clear days.

Nevertheless, poor or absent ventilation under BIPV panels could cause them to overheat and reduce their efficiency. It is well established that the presence of an air gap between a photovoltaic (PV) module and roof covering facilitates ventilation cooling under the device and consequently reduces cell temperature and improves its performance. In this study, we investigated the thermal performance of PV modules installed in a real scale experimental building over a traditional clay tile pitched roof in Italy for almost one year (from August 2009 to June 2010). One PV module was rack-mounted over the roof covering with a 0.2 m air gap; the others were fully integrated and installed at the same level of the roof covering (one with an air gap of 0.04 m, the other mounted directly in contact with the insulation). Temperature and heat flux measurements for each panel, and environmental parameters were recorded. Experimental results demonstrate that even though the rack-mounted PV module constantly maintains cell temperature below that of the other full-building integrated modules, due to the presence of a higher air gap, the difference in the energy produced by the PV modules estimated for the entire monitoring period is less than 4%.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2040093252"}}

In addition, hourly collector\u2019s efficiency increased slightly until 2.00 when steep increase was obtained which peaked at 92% at 4.00 pm.

Environmental concerns often preclude establishment of a new hydro generating plant. Hydro generators are still the main source of renewable energy that is available on a large scale. They are eminently suitable for peaking duty, which often provides attractive returns to the power utilities in privatised electricity markets. Many power utilities therefore resort to upgrading and uprating their ageing generating plants. The hydro generators designed and built around the middle of last century were generously sized by today's standards, and generally permit significant increases in machine output, when contemporary material technology and engineering designs are utilised. Large electrical machines were never manufactured in Australia, and thus locally based practical engineering design experience was never evolved. Over the last 30 years the author has researched and developed a unique domestically based engineering design knowledge and expertise required to test, analyse, redesign and upgrade/uprate existing Australian hydro generators. This paper outlines the approach and general engineering methodology the author has used to upgrade and uprate numerous hydro generators. The hydro generator life span and life cycle are considered, and the scope of possible upgrading and uprating is outlined. The methodology for hydro generator uprating is described, including generator data collection, pre-uprate generator performance testing, electromagnetic and performance analysis, and contents of the final design output.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1985806223"}}

Hourly dynamic cooling load capacities of the building were determined by using Radiant Time Series (RTS) method in the chosen cities. For the analysis, hourly average meteorological data such as atmospheric air temperature and solar radiation belonging to the years 1998-2008 are used for performance prediction of the proposed system. Thermodynamic relations for each component of absorption cooling system is explained and coefficients of performance of the system are calculated. The maximum daily total radiation data were calculated as 7173 W/m2day on July 15, 7277 W/m2 day on July 19 and 7231 W/m2day on July 19 for Mersin, Antalya and Mugla, respectively on the 23\u00b0 toward to south oriented panels from horizontal surface.

The COP values varies between 0.521 and 0.530 for the provinces. In addition, absorber and condenser capacities and thermal efficiency for the absorption cooling system were calculated. The necessary evacuated tube collector area for the different provinces were found in the range of 45 m2 to 47 m2.

The efficiencies of the new collector are compared to that of a PVT collector, with both collectors having the same total area and characteristics.

In Sweden, there are roughly half a million single family houses that use electric heating for both domestic hot water production and space heating. Since electricity is the most expensive energy source in Sweden, it is interesting to install a high solar fraction solar thermal system to reduce the energy use in these houses. One of the most significant bottlenecks for deployment of solar heating technology is economic profitability due to high investment costs. During this investigation a system that retrofits existing domestic hot water heaters was developed. This has the potential to significantly reduce the investment costs regarding both material and installation. Three different collectors were also tested. Their suitability to be part of the retrofitted solar domestic hot water system was addressed. These were a one-axis tracking photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) concentrating hybrid and two stationary compound parabolic concentrating (CPC) collectors with the same geometry. One of the CPC collectors was a thermal collector while the other was a PV/T hybrid collector. The aim for PV/T concentrating hybrid collectors is to produce both heat and electricity at a lower cost than conventional alternatives. The CPC-thermal collector design aims to adapt the solar production to the yearly consumption profile in order to achieve a higher annual solar fraction without increasing the stagnation periods. Outdoor measurements were carried out to characterise the collectors. For the retrofitted system, several system configurations were theoretically analysed by means of simulation models using TRNSYS software. A prototype of the retrofitted system was built and the simulation model was revised and validated against measurements. The validated model was further used to optimize the performance of the system and to carry out a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, an add-on retrofitting unit that is able to connect solar collectors to existing hot water heaters was also designed and built. Measurement results showed that the efficiency values of the tracking concentrating PV/T hybrid are lower than those of conventional flat plate collectors and PV modules. The usable incident irradiation on the one-axis tracking concentrating surface is also lower than the usable irradiation incident on an optimally tilted flat surface. Even though the studied hybrid has potential for improvement, the combination of low efficiencies with low usable irradiation levels makes it difficult for concentrating PV/T hybrids to compete with conventional alternatives, especially in countries where the annual beam irradiation values are low. The geometry of the tested stationary CPC-PV/T hybrid collector was shown not to be the most appropriate for hybrid applications. The studied CPC-thermal collector system was found to achieve a higher annual solar fraction than a conventional flat plate collector system while making use of less absorber surface, one of the most expensive components in the collector. It is concluded that the CPC-thermal collector is adequate to be part of the retrofitting solar domestic hot water system in Swedish single family houses. The decrease in absorber area together with the increase in performance must compensate for the additional cost of extra materials such as reflectors, glass and frames. The investigation of the retrofit system showed that an annual solar fraction of 58 % can be achieved in Sweden when a 200-litre hot water heater is retrofitted and 6 m2 of flat plate collectors is used. The investment cost of the developed retrofit solution was estimated to be reduced by roughly one third compared with a conventional solar domestic hot water system. This means that the developed retrofit system achieves a comparable performance with conventional solar domestic hot water systems in single-family houses with a significant reduction in investment cost. The developed retrofitting solution is therefore considered to have the potential to become a competitive solution in the solar domestic hot water market.

Due to the continuously increasing need for renewable energy, the demand for photovoltaic components is significantly growing. Therefore, many highly productive factories for solar cells will be built in the coming years. The development of tools and methods for rapid planning of state of the art and highly automated production facilities for photovoltaic equipment is the objective of the Saxon PV Automation Cluster (S-PAC). So far the focus of factory planning was strongly on discrete part manufacturing while in contrast the production of solar panels involves a lot of chemical processes with different by-products, even though the final output is discrete parts. Hence, it is investigated how methods and tools of discrete manufacturing still can be applied to photovoltaic industry or where adaptations are necessary. From a methodical point of view the Flow System Theory, comprising material, energy, information, value and personnel flow, as well as Component-based Planning, considering planning process and object components, will be in the focus. While in the past the emphasis was on the optimisation of the material flow, the significance of the energy flow is increasing. The realisation of the information flow requires appropriate tool support. The base of the tool support is provided by the concept of the Net Planning Assistant with the Production Database as central storage component. The Production Data Model as foundation for the Production Database has to be adapted to the differing object domain. A reference database of typical objects of photovoltaic cell, wafer and module production is developed as a basis for datasets of particular projects. Models for visualisation and simulation of the photovoltaic objects are connected to the data model.

Typical architecture designers convey through vague and qualified notions. With the increasing number of PV installations on buildings, architects are forced to corporate with technicians and engineers in the design processes. However, the communications between them are often hindered because unlike architects who communicate through semantic descriptors and visual images, engineers are used to interact with quantified terms. One way to solve this problem is adapting visual impact assessment for PV installed on facade so that one can foresee and evaluate its final overall effect in a way that is comprehensible for both sides. The visual impact assessment is a method mainly used in landscape design for evaluating the influence manmade changes caused on natural landscape. Now it is vastly used on aesthetic assessment for wind farms being built on open landscapes all over the world. Comparing with wind farms, the relevant researches for Photovoltaics are rather underdeveloped. The estimation of visual effect created by integrating solar energy components on open landscape is rarely investigated, let alone on architecture where it is more complicated because more aesthetic factors are involved. With the increasing number of Photovoltaics installed or to be installed on architecture facades, it is necessary to develop a rational visual assessment tool to better evaluate the appearance outcome of the final installation. Based on summarizing research experiences and literatures from former visual impact assessments, this paper tries summarize the possible factors that are relevant for AIPV installation, and changes and extensions on existing theories are being made when necessary. The final results will benefit architects, engineers during the planning process, and eventually for law regulator in laying down clear and reasonable urban planning regulations regarding installing PV in urban areas.

Balance of Systems encompasses the reduction of costs derived from all aspects related with the use of solar other than the photovoltaic panels and inverter.

The climate and energy package is a set of binding legislations which aims to ensure the European Union meets its ambitious climate and energy targets for 2020. These targets, known as the 20-20-20 targets, have set three key objectives: a 20% reduction in the EU greenhouse gas emissions, a 20% rise in the share of EU energy consumption produced from renewable resources and a 20% improvement in the energy efficiency. More renewable energies will enable the EU to lower greenhouse emissions and make it less dependent on imported energy. Boosting the industry of renewables will encourage technological innovation and employment in Europe. On this topic, photovoltaic facades are known to be a solution that allows both energy efficiency and environmental performance of buildings. This paper reports on a study of facade systems that have incorporated photovoltaic panels, considering computational simulations for Portugal. The main objective is to analyze the characteristics and parameters that define more efficient systems based on computer simulations carried out by Solterm 5.0. The results show the high potential of the use of the proposed technology in Portugal, especially in the Southern region, because of its latitude. Regarding energy efficiency and environmental performance, inclined polycrystalline silicon solar panels achieved the best results and the most efficient panel was Kyocera KC167G-2, followed by BP 3160. The comparison between simulation results and results provided in the literature shows that the use of computer programs is viable to the analysis of the energy efficiency of photovoltaic systems in facades. for Dif erent Latitudes silicon cells consist of a large number of small crystals as thick as a human hair and their manufacturing process is cheaper than that of crystalline silicon (Figure 2) (ALTENER, 2004). The amorphous silicon cells (thin films) are made on a support of glass or other synthetic material, onto which a thin layer of silicon is deposited. The efficiency of this type of cell is lower than that of the crystalline cell, but the current produced is reasonable (Figure 3). Among the thin films is also the CdTe cell. CdTe material has been used for applications to calculators and solar modules. These modules, usually in the form of glass panels in a brown / dark blue tone, display a good aesthetic aspect. The production cost of a CdTe cell is low for a large-scale production and this technology has emerged as a major competitor in the market for photovoltaic energy production. Its high efficiency of conversion of solar energy into electric energy is one of its main attractions (Figure 4). Another competitor in the photovoltaic market, also in integrated applications to buildings is the solar cells fabricated from the family of compounds based on copper indium diselenide (CulnSe2 or simply CIS) and diselenide, copper indium gallium (Cu (InGa) Se2, or simply CIGS), mainly because of their potential to achieve relatively high efficiencies. Among the commercially available thin films, CIGS modules have shown the best photovoltaic performance, therefore many companies have been investing in this technology (Rutter, 2004). Differently from traditional silicon cells, CIGS cells can be printed on a material roll, facilitating their transport and installation. Their civil construction uses are limitless and they can be applied to facades, roofs, awnings, etc. (Figure 5). Figure 1. Monocrystalline silicon cell. Figure 2. Polycrystalline silicon cell.

As the problems with the current fossil fuel based energy system are getting more apparent the transition towards a more sustainable energy future is on the top of the political agendas across the world. One source of renewable energy that can play an important role in this future is solar energy. In Brazil the research institute Centro de Tecnologia da Informacao Renato Archer (CTI) was interested in installing a 300 KW/year building integrated photovoltaics plant at their facility located in Campinas. In this plant regular crystalline solar wafers go through an assembly line that can integrate them into a wide variety of building structures such as walls and rooftops. In this way the solar panels become a part of the building instead of an addition to it. During this internship a variety of actions were taken towards realizing the fulfillment of the plant. These actions include designing an appropriate floor plan, the installing and testing of the needed washing plant and mechanical arm, the installing of the solar simulation tunnel and the designing of a number of lay-up and junction box mounting tables. Unfortunately due to external factors and bureaucracy the plant was not finished during the internship period and still a lot of work is needed. However when the plant is fully installed and tested it can start its operation of producing building integrated photovoltaics and more important act as a push in the right direction for the transformation towards a more sustainable energy based future in Brazil.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2306472819"}}

Solar air heater is solar energy collection devices and this collected solar energy is used for low temperature heating purpose,agriculture drying purpose etc.The heat conversion rate of solar energy to heat energy is low in solar air heater because air is flowing fluids and air has low heat transfer coefficient, which is directly influence the rate of heat transfer from the absorber plate to air.This fluid property heat transfer coefficient can be increase by creating turbulence in flow field and the turbulence is created by providing different shape artificial roughness on absorber plate.In this paper the study of heat transfer in a rectangular duct of a solar air heater having trapezoidal rib roughness on the absorber plate is done by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) . The effect on Nusselt number, heat tranfer coefficient, velocity, and temperature parameter are analyzed .This CFD simulation is done by fluent 6.3 software using K-e model Energy is a basic need for human being; it is a prime agent in the generation and economic development. Energy resources may be classified in two ways conventional and non-conventional energy resources. Solar energy is available abundance on earth in the form of radiation. Solar energy is used for heating application and converts it into thermal energy. Solar air heater is the cheapest way of converting solar energy into thermal energy. Thermal performance of solar air heaters is comparably poor from solar water heaters. Thermal performance may be increased by increasing convective heat transfer coefficient. There are two way for increasing heat transfer coefficient either increase the area of absorbing surface by using fins or create the turbulence on the heat transferring surfaces. It has been found that the main thermal resistance to the heat transfer is due to the formation of a laminar sub-layer on the absorber plate heat-transferring surface. An artificial roughness on the heat transfer surface in the form of projections mainly creates turbulence near the wall or breaks the laminar sub-layer and thus enhances the heat transfer coefficient. Various investigators have studied different types of roughness geometries and their arrangements. Bhushan and Singh (1) presented data on the influence of Reynolds number on heat transfer coefficient distribution on the surface having staggered array of protrusion geometry. In some cases, enhancement in heat transfer rate is about 2.5 times than smooth surface value over a range of Reynolds number.Yadav and Bhagoria (2) conducted a numerical prediction to study only heat transfer behavior of a rectangular duct of a solar air heater having triangular rib roughness on the absorber plate.Ravigururajan and Bergles (3) used four types of roughness, namely semicircular, circular, rectangular and triangular ribs to develop the general statistical correlations for heat transfer and pressure drop for single phase turbulent flow in internally ribbed surface. Liou and Hwang (4) tested three shapes of rib roughness, namely square, triangular and semicircular ribs to study the effect of rib shapes on turbulent solar system is never designed to meet the complete energy demand of the application for which it is installed. Providing a system to supply 100 percent of the energy requirement at all times would result in a system which is oversized for most of the time. The resulting initial cost would make the investment uneconomical. A solar system is thus often used in conjunction with an auxiliary system using conventional energy. The auxiliary sources help to meet unusual high demand situations. It also takes care of situations which arise when solar energy is not available in adequate measure because of adverse weather conditions.Prasad and Saini (5) investigated effect of relative roughness height (e/D) and relative roughness pitch (p/e) on heat transfer and friction.Authors reported that increase in relative roughness height results decrease in rate of heat transferenhancement although rate of increase of friction factor increases. And increase in relative roughness pitch (p/e) results decrease in rate of heat transfer and friction.Momin et al. (6) experimentally investigated effect of geometrical parameters of V-shaped ribs on heat transfer and fluid flow characteristics inrectangular duct of solar air heater. It has been reported by authors that rate of increase of Nusselt number with an increase in Reynolds number is lower than rate of increase of friction factored. Use of artificial roughness to increase heat transfer coefficient has been studied using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) by various investigators.

Atrium is an architectural feature often found in commercial buildings in Malaysia and the top-lit type is the most common. Besides its architectural value as a spatial connector, the introduction of translucent material as its roof envelope could turn it into a large daylight catcher. Its ability to serve as a media to allow entry of sun into the building means that it could bring in both daylight as well as excessive solar heat. For buildings in the tropical climate zone such as Malaysia, maximizing solar gain is most undesirable, as this will increase the indoor temperature and consequently unnecessary amount of energy is needed to cool back down the internal spaces to an acceptable thermal comfort level. A good energy efficient strategy is to channel the intense solar heat away from the interior, and capture its energy resource. Photovoltaic (PV) panel or commonly known as solar panel converts solar energy into electrical energy. Its productivity depends largely on its solar exposure hours, the placement of its panels in terms of the slope angle and orientation to the sun. When applied in buildings, PV is referred to as Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV). BIPV system is a relatively expensive investment, thus its application has to be carefully considered to achieve optimization. Theoretically replacement of the conventional glass skylight with PV panels, improves the energy efficiency of the atrium through electrical energy production of the PV panels. It offsets the additional energy required to cool down the space due to solar heat gain. This thesis was set up to achieve three main objectives - firstly was to determine the amount of energy production through a modeling of basic BIPV (Building Integrated Photovoltaic) configurations for installation in atria. Secondly was to assess if the power generated is more than the additional cooling load required to compensate (off-set) the increase of indoor temperature leading from the solar heat gain due to the change in the skylight material. The final objective was to determine the best roof model and orientation to achieve optimum BIPV application. Three roof form types (hipped, gable and sawtooth) were shortlisted due to their suitable application with opaque PV panels that by far, its power productivity is better than the thin film type. To give a fair comparison, the roof surface area of all the three types were made similar (2325 sq m), and 10% of the surface area was of glazing, so as to provide minimum acceptable indoor illumination of 350 lux. Dependence variables were roof surface inclination (30\u00b0), PV type (Kyocera), PV surface area (2250 sq m), orientations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W. NW), day of the year (March 28, the clearest sky, and March 7, the cloudiest). The independence variable was the roof form. The extra energy required was determined by subtracting the U-value of the conventional skylight glazing material from the U-value of the PV panel, and multiply by the total surface area of the PV used. ECOTECT environmental software was later used to determine the power productivity of BIPV applications for the respective roof form types in eight (8) main orientations. The results indicate that the maximum PV generation for all the roof models are achieved at N270\u00b0 orientation. The highest energy generator was the Gable type, with the highest power productivity recorded at five out of the eight orientations (N0\u00b0, N45\u00b0, N90\u00b0, N135\u00b0 and N180\u00b0). The Sawtooth type generated the highest power productivity at three orientations (N225\u00b0, N270\u00b0 and N315\u00b0), however its production is the least if oriented at N90\u00b0 by 18.7%. In conclusion, the study identified the Gable model to be the most flexible for BIPV application purposes where it offers highest average power productivity of 394,059.7 kWh. in all eight orientations. The average power production from the BIPV application was 383,621 kWh, which is more than the additional power needed to normalize the solar heat gain due to replacement of the roof material by 200%.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2897364540"}}

Electricity consumption in Ecuador has sustained growth by the development that has taken the construction industry; on the other hand, more and more companies are looking for energy efficiency measures. Thinking about the environment, solar energy is a way to get electricity without polluting it and making it through photovoltaic panels, is the best choice for both residential and commercial buildings so that can be attached to any building material. This business plan aims to demonstrate the business opportunity that a company that generates renewable energy has a new way to achieve economic success generating shared value. The interest that have the industry of design and construction by the use of renewable energies as alternatives for sustainable architecture, have allowed the development of new trends and advanced technologies. The use of photovoltaic panels in our country is limited to modules with specific measures to be installed on horizontal surfaces such as roofs or yards, so this plan proposes the installation of custom panels and as a front surround.

The objective of this paper is to assess the use of Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) panels in residential house in three countries in the Gulf region; namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar. A typical Villa-type house in these countries will be assessed when PV is installed and the total annual reduction as well as peak load reduction in electrical energy will be calculated for each country. The reduction is then be propagated all the way in the decrease of CO2 emission at the power station. The results are then extrapolated for all residential houses in these countries and the total CO2 saving can then be estimated. An economic analysis is presented and the payback period for the BIPV is calculated taking into account the initial cost and the maintenance cost. BIPV is the main application for solar energy in building. As the number of PV being manufactured increases, the cost of PV is becoming more competitive and appealing.

Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) have been the subject of research and design applications for several decades. While some large-scale applications have been realized, prohibitively high costs and multiple technical complexities persist. A main cause of these challenges is a lack of system-level design and engineering ofphotovoltaic (PV) systems coupled with traditional methods of building construction. PV installation remains a highly specialized construction practice and is typically completed by skilled experts in the field who deal with intricate electrical connections like wiring to batteries and inverters. This complicated installation process, in addition to other soft costs like permitting and system components, account for approximately fifty percent of the overall cost of a solar power system. The installation of photovoltaic systems must be simplified and streamlined to make PV more cost effective. Furthermore, existing BIPV strategies fail to address two key concerns that have negatively impacted the power output and efficiency of the system: optimal tilt angle and high cell temperature. Low cell efficiency will continue to hinder BIPV's penetration in the market without design strategies that ensure higher yields. This thesis presents the design, development, and construction of two novel BIPV products. One is integrated with masonry construction, and the other is integrated with pre-fabricated panel construction. An experimental methodology was developed in order to test and analyze the effectiveness of the systems' design strategies for providing an optimal tilt angle, cooling and heat recovery capabilities, and finally, financial viability. Preliminary results reveal that the optimal geometry of the system provides 30% more power compared to vertically oriented wall systems. Secondly, the strategy for cell cooling provides the system with on average 9% more power. Lastly, the integration of these systems during construction can decrease overall costs by as much as 17% compared to typical PV systems.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2952466600"}}

The term solar air heating is a technology in which the radiant energy emitted by the sun is captured in an absorber and is used for space heating. Needless to say it is a renewable and pollution free method to produce space heating and when is used in commercial buildings or industries could be very cost effective. Improvement in the thermo hydraulic performance of a solar air heater can be done by enhancing the heat transfer. In general, heat transfer enhancement techniques are divided into two groups: active and passive techniques. Providing an artificial roughness on a heat transferring surface is an effective passive heat transfer technique to enhance the rate of heat transfer to fluid flow. In this paper, reviews of various artificial roughness elements used as passive heat transfer techniques, in order to improve thermo hydraulic performance of a solar air heater, is done. The objective of this paper is to review various studies, in which different artificial roughness elements are used to enhance the heat transfer rate with little penalty of friction. In this review paper, solar air heaters are discussed along with the problems associated, when use on large scale. Improvement in present technologies which are used for the manufacture of solar air heaters is the main area of focus in this paper and recent progress in enhancing the design of solar air duct are reported.

Solar energy is an abundant resource, especially in Australia. While increasing numbers of households, businesses and utility companies are installing photovoltaics to combat climate change and ever increasing power bills, network operators are having to deal with the problems this can cause such as voltage rise and other power quality issues. Monitoring of PV systems is becoming increasingly more important in addressing such issues, as is localised environmental monitoring. Utilising different sensors to measure solar radiation, ambient temperature and wind speed, network operators are better able to predict and react to environmental changes which can affect the output of PV systems.   This report focuses on the installation of an environmental and PV inverter monitoring system for the Photovoltaic Training Facility on the Engineering and Energy Building at Murdoch University. This work follows on from that of Stuart Kempin who designed and managed the installation of the PV Training Facility and Mael Riou who designed much of the environmental monitoring system.   The environmental monitoring system consists of two anemometers, a wind vane, an ambient temperature sensor, two pyranometers (one mounted horizontally and one mounted on the plane of the PV array) and RTD temperature sensors for PV module temperature measurement. The communication interface for these sensors incorporates I/O modules from Avantech\u2019s ADAM 4000 series and communicates via RS485 with a computer running the LabView programming software for monitoring and logging purposes. Design work for the environmental monitoring system is now complete, including specifications and drawings for the mounting brackets.   For monitoring the PV inverters, serial communication is also utilised. Where required, each inverter is fitted with a serial communication card which is wired to the same computer used for environmental monitoring via an RS485 to USB adapter. Again, the LabView programming software is used to monitor the inverters. All physical aspects of the inverter monitoring system have been completed. This includes the selection and acquisition of a suitable computer interface along with enclosure design and construction to suit. Installation of serial communication cards in the inverters and wiring and connection of the inverters has also been completed.   Several smaller assignments were also undertaken over the course of the project such as the review of technical diagrams provided by the installer of the PV Training Facility and testing of the SMA Backup system to ensure correct functionality. Some background information on the functional earthing of PV arrays is given and discussed in relation to the PV Training Facility. Unfortunately, 3 final schematic diagrams of the system have not yet been obtained however sections of the actual system configuration including the functional earthing arrangement have been confirmed.   The eventual goal of the system is to provide a solid, safe and informative teaching platform which can be used in the future to educate students on the role such monitoring systems may have in real-world scenarios. It is also planned to utilise the system to compare PV technologies and inverter topologies and their reactions under different environmental conditions.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W401662058"}}

One of the city of Stockholm\u2019s main objectives is to have a society completely free from fossil fuels. To achieve this, several investments regarding improvements in energy efficiency and renewable energy are currently being planned or implemented. One of these investments is a project called Hallbara Jarva which is located in the suburbs of Stockholm. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the prospects of an investment in photovoltaic cells from an energy-saving and economical point of view. The analysis is limited to three buildings within Hallbara Jarva and is intended for the property owner. Solar energy is a type of renewable energy source and is commonly divided into solar heating and solar power. This thesis introduces both techniques but the calculations are limited to solar power. The many types of technical solutions for photovoltaic cells all derives from the same phenomena. In commercial applications The photovoltaic cells are connected with a power inverter to form a power providing system. To approach the issue an analysis of three main areas is made. Primarily the photovoltaic system is sized based on the electricity consumption in the buildings. Furthermore an assessment is made whether or not the photovoltaic system is a profitable investment. Lastly a comparison between the output of the analysis and the main renewable energy objectives for Hallbara Jarva is made. The final result is obtained which states that the photovoltaic system yields a sufficient amount of electricity during the summer, to meet the electricity requirements in the buildings. The system should be sized so that the monthly electricity production never exceeds the demand. An evaluation of this particular investment determines that it yields a small profit.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W421361969"}}

The Climate Protocol is working on a roadmap with guidelines on how to achieve the current climate goals. The roadmap is expected to be finished in year 2014, and it is currently being investigated to what extent solar energy could contribute to achieving the climate goals. The purpose of this study is to estimate the solar energy potential in the municipality of Uppsala for the years 2020 and 2050 based on an assessment of what a prospective utilization of solar energy systems on rooftops could potentially generate. The addressed solar techniques are photovoltaics based systems and solar thermal collectors.The results indicate that an optimal rooftop area of 5.9 km\u00b2 is estimated in Uppsala municipality by 2020, and 8.8 km\u00b2 by 2050. The total solar energy potential in the municipality is estimated to 1.5 TWh in 2020 and 1.9 TWh in 2050. Thus, approximately half of all the buildings energy consumption in the municipality could potentially be covered by solar energy.A sensitivity analysis is carried out to test the results by altering input parameters and components. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the solar energy potential would increase by optimizing roof deployment areas when constructing new buildings and improving the solar efficiency for photovoltaics.

Electricity consumption in Brazil grew 47% in the last decade, and it is estimated to grow other 55,6% by 2020. Most of this electricity is generated in large, centralized hydropower plants. Generation expansion to meet this growing demand is also based on construction of new hydropower plants, which are located far from consumption centers. This distance between generation and consumption leads to considerable transmission and distribution losses. One way to reduce such losses is through distributed generation, where the electricity is generated near or at the point of consumption, for example, integrated to buildings. This concept has led to the development of the Net Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB). ZEBs are buildings with greatly reduced energy needs through efficiency gains such that the balance of energy needs can be supplied with renewable technologies. From the available options to generate electricity onsite, photovoltaic (PV) modules have been the most used worldwide. The ability to generate electricity almost anywhere, without emissions and noise, it \u0301s modularity and the fact that it requires no fuel to operate makes PV ideal for the integration to buildings. Considering that buildings were responsible for 46,9% of the Brazilian\u2019s electricity consumption in 2010, and that their contribution will raise by 2020, with the residential sector increasing its share, according to estimates made by EPE, from 23,8% to 25,3% of the total electricity consumption, while the commercial sector will increase from 15% to 18,8%. A greater adoption of the photovoltaic energy in buildings can therefore meet part of this demand, and postpone or prevent the construction of new large hydroelectric and fossil fueled thermoelectric plants. This paper evaluates the possibility of a living laboratory in the University of Campinas to achieve a ZEB status through the use of a multi photovoltaic technology system.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4389127434"}}

The field of photovoltaics has undergone dramatic growth over the past few years. This growth has been accompanied by two significant changes in the commercial photovoltaic (PV) market. 1.The major PV market has shifted from the residential and commercial building markets to central station utility power markets. With this switch has come a new focus on the long-term reliability and durability of PV modules and systems. If you are installing tens or even hundreds of megawatts of PV modules, it is absolutely necessary to ensure that they will continue to perform adequately throughout their expected lifetime of at least 25 years. 2.Selling prices for PV modules have decreased from more than $4 per watt to less than $1 per watt in the last 5 years. This reduction in selling process has been driven by low-cost production in the developing world. This means that most of today's PV modules are being manufactured by companies that did not exist 10 or, in many cases, even 5 years ago.

In urban planning and architectural design, therefore, access to sunlight has been a primary consideration since human beings have been creating built environments. The sun is also a significant replacement for current restrictive fuels. Since the energy crisis in the 1970s, increasing interest in solar energy has motivated many modern cities in the world to establish different methods for gaining sunlight access in modern building development. Zoning, a regulatory device defining the maximum volume of a building by its relationship with other buildings and with land use, has been applied as the best strategy to achieve this objective. In this study, twelve existing zoning laws and guidelines for solar access throughout the world were analyzed and compared. Case studies were initially classified by sunlight types. Next, the constraints, tools, and other considerations were investigated by type. Lastly, each classification was evaluated by urban development density, energy conversion, and energy savings.

Flat plate solar thermal collectors are used around the world in both domestic and industrial fields as a simple and effective method to heat water. Avoiding condensation in solar collectors at night is a crucial issue in terms of their durability and performance. During the night the temperature of the collector will often drop below the ambient temperature due to thermal radiation in the cold air. In climates where the air at night becomes saturated with humidity, condensation will form both on the inside and outside of the collector glazing. Condensation on the glazing means energy is wasted in evaporating the moisture throughout the following day. If too much condensation occurs on the inside of the glazing, it will drip on to the absorber surface, which will consequently lead to long-term damage. The objective of this study was to undertake the development of a model, and to validate it. This will determine the frequency of condensation in glazed flat plate solar water heaters and the all parameters which are involved in this phenomenon. The numerical model showed that climatic factors including relative humidity, ambient temperature and wind speed determine the frequency of condensation for any given location.

A solar-energy based vapor absorption refrigeration system is potentially an excellent alternative air-conditioning system. However, there are several research challenges to ensure sufficient efficiency and reliability for ensuring widespread implementation. Integration of a parabolic trough solar collector utilizing a mixture of nanoparticles and water with a vapor absorption system has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency of the system. Such a system makes use of the superior thermo-physical properties of the nanofluid compared to the base fluid. Moreover, the direct absorption phenomenon of solar radiation through interaction with the participating medium (nanofluid) results in a higher temperature rise of the medium in conjunction with higher operating efficiencies as well. At the same time there are certain challenges that need to be identified and addressed in the implementation of this novel concept. For instance, to make it reliable, the system further needs to be integrated with a thermal storage system which facilitates air-conditioning even during non-sunshine hours. Integration of vapor absorption refrigeration technology, parabolic trough with water-nanoparticles mixture as the absorbing medium and a thermal storage facility is the uniqueness of this design which under certain conditions and locations may prove to be an efficient and reliable substitute to the conventional electrical air-conditioning systems.

Therefore, an emergency photovoltaic system has been suggested as a first step in this regard. The system is a standalone PV system that could be simply installed and used in residential buildings. PV area has been estimated, and system installation has been three-dimensionally modelled. System performance has been compared in two cases: PV installation on the roof and on the southern facade. Results show that both examined cases are feasible due to the abundant availability of solar energy in Gaza Strip. A simple stand-alone PV system with 5 m2 PV panels can meet the basic needs of Palestinian households in the cases of emergency or daily power interruption.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1522686547"}}

When using the integrated approach, the solar systems become part of the general building design, In fact they are also often become regular building elements. This is due to the fact that integrating the solar systems in the building envelope often is a necessity if the systems are to be economically feasible. The solar elements cannot be separate elements that are added after the building, or at least the architectural design of it, is completed. They must rather replace other building elements, thereby serving dual functions and reducing total costs. Case studies represents a coming of age of building-integrated photovoltaics. The PV elements are specially designed for glass shading devices. The photovoltaics will serve as shading elements and use an area protected by the new system.

ABSTRACT: Bifacial photovoltaic modules can convert solar energy to electrical energy from both sides of the module. This means that light reflecting off the rooftop and hitting the rear side of the module can also be converted. Tropical climates such as Singapore have plenty of sunlight to produce power from photovoltaics, with diffuse content of more than 50% of the total irradiance. Our interest is to know the behaviour and performance of bifacial modules under these conditions. In the present study, commercially available bifacial and monofacial modules of the same cell technology were installed in Singapore on a rooftop at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and data for various electrical parameters are being collected. The performance ratio with respect to the horizontal-plane irradiance has been measured to find the optimum tilt angle of the bifacial modules for Singapore. The gain in short-circuit current has been studied with respect to the diffuse/global irradiance ratio and the time of the day. The results from this study will provide guidelines for the optimal installation of these modules in the tropics, and will also help to improve the design of bifacial modules for tropical climate conditions. Keywords: Bifacial PV module, diffuse radiation, tropical climate 1 INTRODUCTION In contrast to monofacial PV modules, which only convert light which enters the module via the front side into electricity, bifacial PV modules can convert light which enters the module from either side. This means that bifacial modules can perform better than monofacial modules when installed under the same conditions. This module type can enhance the power density (power per unit area) and thus area related costs such as land, cabling, installation structure etc. can be reduced [1]. A power gain of 50% from bifacial modules as compared to monofacial modules has been reported in the literature for specific installation conditions [2]. The potential applications of bifacial modules such as noise barrier along highways, fence integrated PV system, component of building architectures, static concentrating system, multifunctional bifacial PV sun shading element etc. have been reported by various authors [3-6]. The energy gain of a bifacial module over a monofacial module depends on a number of factors, including the installation parameters as well as the characteristics of the incident irradiance, since these factors affect the amount of light which can enter via the rear side of the module. To estimate the gain from bifacial modules, various simulation and experimental methods have been proposed in the literature [7, 8]. The solar radiation in tropical climates like Singapore can be characterised by large diffuse content in the global irradiance. Hence, to know the performance and behaviour of bifacial modules in the tropical climate of Singapore, it is necessary to have the experimental data for the bifacial modules in these climatic conditions. This experimental data can help in optimising the bifacial PV modules and the PV installations for the tropical climate of Singapore. 2 OUTDOOR INSTALLATION SET-UP AND MEASUREMENTS Commercially available bifacial and monofacial modules of the same silicon solar cell technology were installed in Singapore (on a rooftop at the National University of Singapore, NUS) in December 2011.

The building envelops are now becoming real \u201cactive skins\u201d with a very important energetic potential. The paradigm of architecture undergoes a soft equilibrium among aesthetic and utility, varies along history and tends naturally, but unconsciously, towards an increase of the energy consumption per inhabitant and home. The struggle for an improvement of the energy requirements of the buildings, and specifically, the activation of the skin of the buildings as electric energy generators, aims to a neutral energy balance. Modern technologies can help the building to achieve the equality in production and consumption of energy by devices with a high degree of integration and aesthetics. Thin film solar cells (TFSC) have attracted a great interest in last years in the building sector because of their interesting properties as integrated elements [1,2]. This is mainly motivated by (i) their thermal behavior and performance at low light conditions (shadow, not orientated, etc.), (ii) the possibility to use different materials as substrates (glass, steel, polymers, etc.) and (iii) their ability to be manufactured in an aesthetic way (semitransparent, coloured, etc.). This makes a thin film module to be well integrated in a non intrusive way. The use of new building materials is directed to ensure that all new buildings have the minimum environmental impact possible. An alternative to traditional solutions is ETFE polymer (a co-polymer of ethylene and tetrafluoroethylene), which has been used for the past 20 years for atria and other overhead glazing. Nowadays, ETFE polymer, a transparent plastic related to Teflon, is considered the building material of the future and is replacing glass and plastic in some of the most innovative buildings [3]. In this context, the purpose of this work is to develop an innovative multi-functional flexible photovoltaic element composed by colored semitransparent solar cells, which shows several of the following features: enhanced modularity; simplicity of installation and utilization; suitability for use in a distributed generation configuration; flexibility in the utilization; easiness to integrate in buildings. In addition, different colors and transparencies can make many different esthetically pleasing results possible. To achieve this objective, the multi-functional PV element will be developed by following the next steps: a) Development of TFSC based on a-Si:H technology (superstrate configuration) using ETFE foils as substrate following the basic structure of ordinary a-Si:H solar cells. b) Microscopic holes, formed by laser patterning, will make the solar cell semi-transparent, adjusting the transmittance by changing the area of the holes [4]. c) Incorporation of lighting devices (LED) on the edge of the device, providing added value to the building element. d) Encapsulation process of the PV element by the stack colored EVA+ETFE as backsheet. Therefore, the final multi-functional PV flexible element will have the following structure: ETFE substrate / TFSC based on a-Si:H (superstrate configuration) / LED devices /colored EVA / ETFE backsheet.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W98989281"}}

Four simulation models using forced circulation flow with different system configurations and control strategies were simulated and analysed in the study. A comparison with a standard solar thermal system was also presented based on the annual solar fraction. The simulation results indicate that the retrofitting configuration achieving the highest annual performance consists of a system where the existing tank is used as storage for the solar heat and a smaller tank with a heater is added in series to make sure that the required outlet temperature can be met. An external heat exchanger is used between the collector circuit and the existing tank. For this retrofitted system an annual solar fraction of 50.5% was achieved.

The reduction of electricity use for heating and domestic hot water in cold climates can be achieved by: (1) reducing the heating loads through the improvement of the thermal performance of house envelopes, and (2) using solar energy through a residential solar-based thermal storage system. First, this paper presents the life cycle energy and cost analysis of a typical one-storey detached house, located in Montreal, Canada. Simulation of annual energy use is performed using the TRNSYS software. Second, several design alternatives with improved thermal resistance for walls, ceiling and windows, increased overall air tightness, and increased window-to-wall ratio of South facing windows are evaluated with respect to the life cycle energy use, life cycle emissions and life cycle cost. The solution that minimizes the energy demand is chosen as a reference house for the study of long-term thermal storage. Third, the computer simulation of a solar heating system with solar thermal collectors and long-term thermal storage capacity is presented. Finally, the life cycle cost and life cycle energy use of the solar combisystem are estimated for flat-plate solar collectors and evacuated tube solar collectors, respectively, for the economic and climatic conditions of this study.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2028882421"}}

Abstract : The United States is currently consuming fossil fuels faster than natural processes can replace them. Our nation's leaders recognize that a diverse energy portfolio including renewable energy is the key to maintaining our economy, security, and the environment. The federal government is by far the greatest energy consumer; thus, our nation's leaders have directed federal agencies to strive to increase the use of renewable energy at federal facilities. Solar electricity technologies, in the form of photovoltaics, have great potential in the renewable energy mix. Although a major strategy should be integrating photovoltaics into the design of new facilities, an important early consideration should be the installation of photovoltaic modules in open areas and/or module retrofits onto existing structures. This research developed a model based on decision makers' value systems to quantify and rank several photovoltaic technologies. The goal of the model was to determine what alternatives would most align with Air Force energy and environmental objectives. After working with subject matter experts at three bases, a comprehensive hierarchy was developed. This hierarchy was then used to find the best alternatives at one base. It was found that photovoltaic technologies may indeed successfully compete with grid-supplied electricity when utilizing a value-focused approach.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W326835606"}}

In tropical Singapore, buildings receive a high amount of solar radiation. Windows should therefore consist of solar control glazing with a low solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) and high visible light transmittance to reduce the energy consumption for air-conditioning and electrical lighting respectively. Due to the rising demand for on-site electricity generation, photovoltaic modules are increasingly used in buildings, initially as roof-top systems, but in recent years there are also semi-transparent photovoltaic (STPV) being integrated into the fa\u00e7ade or overhead glazing. However, their SHGC is usually not reported, potentially preventing STPV from widespread adoption. The paper presents measurements and novel presentations of SHGC for selected thin-film STPV glazing. It introduces SERIS\u2019 indoor calorimetric hot box and solar simulator including a documentation of environmental conditions and calibrations. A sensitivity analysis concluded that the SHGC measurement is mainly sensitive to the spectrum of the solar simulator and reflection properties of the absorber plate. A correction factor was introduced and the measured results compare well with simulations. In addition, SHGC values for selected STPV are presented as (a) angular dependent and (b) load dependent. The results show that the SHGC is sensitive to the incident angle of solar radiation. Particularly for incident angles above 45\u00b0, which would be typical for facades in the tropics, the SHGC reduces significantly, compared to the default at 0\u00b0. The SHGC reduces only marginally when an electrical load is connected. Higher PV efficiencies would result in more energy being converted into electricity and not into re-radiating heat and therefore producing a lower SHGC.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2046857890"}}

The purpose of this paper was twofold. First, to answer some questions that came up during the design process of the plant by using a TRNSYS system model and statistical tools. Second, to gain knowledge about the plant operation and validate the TRNSYS model through measured data. The system was equipped with a flat-plate collector field of 38.4 m2. A lithium bromide-water single-effect absorption chiller (17.6 kW) was selected in order to provide chilled water to fan-coils.

In the light of global warming, renewables such as solar photovoltaics (PV) are important to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. An important issue regarding implementation of solar panels on large scale, is the limited available area. Therefore, it can be interesting to combine PV with alternative applications, as a ways of not requiring \u201cadditional\u201d space. One example is a photovoltaic noise barrier (PVNB), where a noise barrier located along a highway or railway is used as substructure for PV modules. Even though a PVNB is not a novel concept, the absence of economic assessments in literature can be a barrier to their wider implementation. In this paper, a feasibility study of a PVNB in Belgium is conducted, using a cost benefit analysis including a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis. Besides purely economic aspects, also ecological benefits are monetized. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the ecological benefit of noise reduction, which is valuated using a noise sensitivity depreciation index applied to real estate prices, is of major importance in determining the net present value of the case study. On the contrary, the impact of reducing CO2 emissions seems to be negligible when expressed in monetary terms. The results suggest that the PVNB as a whole and also its separate components \u2013i.e. the PV array and the noise barrier\u2013 can be profitable projects, when ecological benefits are included.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1997471698"}}

From a path breaking innovation, electricity has grown into one of the most important factors helping us to sustain civilization today. The entire world economy is dependent on technology today. Yet, certain remote areas are deprived of this basic amenity, either due to the lack of concern from the authorities or due to the unawareness about harvesting locally available resources. In this paper, the challenges faced by one such area are identified and the issue is solved by utilizing alternate energy source. This paper describes how rural electrification can be implemented in a cost-effective manner without compromising efficiency. The area under study is located farthest from the existing power grid and the high expenditure that has to be incurred in its electrification withdrew the authority from this task. However the project team formed under the Local Integrated Network of Kerala IEEE Students identified that the solar energy can be harvested in the area. All the project parameters were analyzed in detail and thorough research was done on the land and its inhabitants. Underground cables were chosen as the means of transmission.

The system modelling is carried out in MATLAB-SIMULINK where the PV array is formed by five series connected identical PV modules. Under uniform solar irradiance conditions, the PV module and the PV array present nonlinear P-V characteristic but the maximum power point (MPP) can be easily identified. However, when the PV array is under shaded conditions, the P-V characteristic becomes more complex with the present of multiple MPP. While the PV array operated at local MPP, the generated power is limited. Thus, the investigation on MPPT approach is carried out to maximize the PV generated power even when the PV array is under partially shaded conditions (PSC). Fuzzy logic is adopted into the conventional MPPT to form fuzzy logic based MPPT (FMPPT) for better performance. The developed MPPT and FMPPT are compared, particularly the performances on the transient response and the steady state response when the array is under various shaded conditions.

And a-Si BIPV case which is not used in any insulations is more effective to save cooling energy and bock the direct solar radiation than Clear double case. and if a-Si BIPV case with low-performance is applied to spandrel area, back-side surface temperature effectively maintain a low temperature.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2133606169"}}

The large module cells are replaced by small string modules and the highly specular materials are replaced with low-cost diffuse materials.Concentrating sunlight onto a solar module has an effect of hot-spot formation which reduces the fill factor and hence the efficiency of the photovoltaic system. To address this problem, diffuse reflectors with rolling marks either parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the module were tested in low Concentrating photovoltaic systems. The changes in the fill factor were monitored as different reflector materials were replaced within concentrator geometries. It was experimentally shown that diffuse reflectors gave better fill-factor than specular reflectors. It was further demonstrated that diffuse reflectors with rolling grooves aligned parallel to the plane of the module gave better fill-factor than diffuse reflectors with rolling grooves aligned perpendicular to the plane of the module surface. In particular, the power increased by a factor of 2 in all reflector materials studied but the drop in the fill factor was 28% for rolling marks parallel to the plane of the module as compared to 30% for rolling marks perpendicular to the plane of the module. The parallel rolling marks (horizontal grooves) gave improved fill factor. Probably the rolling marks scattered the solar flux within the concentrator geometry at large angles and hence evenly illuminated the solar cell module area. The vertical grooves on the other hand had low angle scattering of the solar flux and could not spread the solar flux along the plane of the module. The vertical orientation of the grooves had similar performance as specular reflectors. Furthermore, the performance of the CPC geometry with semi-diffuse aluminium foil was under estimated due to construction errors as compared with anodized aluminium which gave a better performance as it was used as the base material. It was also verified that anodized aluminium, miro and rolled aluminium foil respectively, were the best reflector materials that withstood the environmental conditions.However, due to its low cost, the rolled aluminium foil was preferred for use in low concentrating photovoltaic systems.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2621256948"}}

The shift from traditional fossil fuels to renewables is implying a diffusion of \u201cvisible\u201d PV modules in our buildings and landscapes. In contrast with traditional fossil fuels, which were hidden in the ground somewhere, far from the city life, renewable energy generation systems, and Photovoltaics (PV) in particular, are visible. This change is generally perceived as negative by the public, since the introduction of PV is evaluated as disturbing the pre-existing. Pre-existing can be understood as the landscape whose image the public is used to, at the small scale as well as at the large scale (buildings and natural or built landscapes). Research carried out in the past years has been done to solve the problem by integrating PV into buildings, that is trying to hide PV in shapes that the public already knows, without consuming additional ground surfaces. Nevertheless, the European and national policies are pushing towards an increasing use of PV, so that now its use is not limited at the building scale, but includes the landscape scale. How could landscapes look like to incorporate this energy source? How would these energy needs match the needs related to the preservation of our landscapes?

The production of electricity from renewable sources plays a strategic role in the future of energy because it helps to effectively manage climate change through an energy generation portfolio with lower emissions of greenhouse gases. Photovoltaic solar energy is safe and sustainable and is characterised by a growing trend with a cumulative installed capacity that has reached a total of 40 GW in 2010. In this paper, investigations are presented using multiple calculations: Energy Payback Time (EPBT), Greenhouse Gas per kilowatt hour (GHG/kWh), Energy Return on Investment (EROI), Greenhouse Gas Payback Time (GPBT) and Greenhouse Gas Return on Investment (GROI). These metrics make it possible to define the energy and environmental performances for a building-integrated photovoltaic system located in Italy. The module efficiency, the embodied energy and the annual solar irradiance are variables that play a strong role in this analysis. The key parameters include the type of solar cells (e.g., mono-crystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride) and the location where the system is installed (Milan, Rome and Palermo).

A Solar Wall Heating (SWH) system was developed to provide low cost space heating in traditional solid stone-walled tenement buildings in Scotland. The SWH system uses the internal solid walls to store the solar heat collected during the day and heat the bedrooms during the night. A physical laboratory model with attached solar hot water system and a computational model of it were developed to investigate the dynamic performance of the system in use and test the cost benefits of iterations of its modes of use. The temperatures throughout the wall structure were measured under the variant solar input of a 24-h cycle. An unsteady state CFD model was developed and validated using the measured data and setup to test a number of key variables of the solar wall heating system in use. These included optimisation control strategies and maximisation strategies for the collection and storage of solar heat under various conditions. This paper presents the modelled results of the solar thermal storage and optimisation system and strategies for internal solid stone walls in a typical Scottish tenement flat in the Scottish climate.

First, temperature in the air space, located between window layer and finishing layer of the spandrel area, can significantly increase by solar heat gain, because the space has a few air density relative to other spaces in building. Secondly, PV has a characteristics of decreased Voltage(Voc and Vmp) with the increased temperature on the PV cell. For these reasons, this research analyzed a direct interrelation between PV Cell temperature and electricity generation performance under different insulation conditions in the spandrel area. The different insulation conditions under consideration are 1) high insulated spandrel(HIS) 2) low insulated spandrel(LIS) 3) PV stand alone on the ground(SAG). As a result, in case of 1) HIS, PV temperature was increased and thus electricity generation efficiency was decreased more than other cases. To be specific, each cases` maximum temperature indicated that 1) HIS is , 2) LIS is , and 3) SAG is . Also, each cases yield electricity generation like that 1) HIS is 913.3kWh/kWp, 2) LIS is 942.8kWh/kWp, and 3) SAG is 981.3kWh/kWp. These result showed that it is needed for us to seek to the way how the PV Cell temperature would be decreased.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2000931303"}}

Solar panel systems placed either on building roofs or in the fields have become popular worldwide during the last decades since their contribution to environmental friendly energy production is remarkable. Their exposure to wind loads results to wind-induced loading which cannot be predicted efficiently because design standards and codes provide very little information. The main objective of this study is to determine and assess how different combination of parameters can affect the wind flow and thus the pressure distribution on the surface of the panels. For this purpose, wind tunnel tests were performed in the Building Aerodynamics laboratory of Concordia University.  Literature review was conducted demonstrating experimental results from previous studies for stand-alone panels and those attached to building roofs. A 1:200 scale model was fabricated consisting of a building and panels attached to the roof. The model was tested in the wind tunnel for different configurations, such as two different building heights and the case without the building, two panel locations and 4 panel inclinations for 13 angles of wind attack. The acquired data was transformed into mean and peak force, local and area-averaged pressure coefficients. Different configurations result in different pressure distribution indicating those parameters contributing to the most critical cases.

Solar heating and cooling (SHC) technologies exploit solar irradiation to either produce heat or, alternatively, provide air conditioning.

Solar collectors for heating can be divided into flat-plate or air collectors, evacuated tube collectors and unglazed panels. In the case of air conditioning, the dominant technologies being used today are: closed chillers, which use either liquid or solid sorption materials, and open cooling cycles. In this chapter, different analyses about technology trends and how cost can be close to conventional heating and cooling systems are exposed. Moreover, it is appreciated how solar cooling systems operate more efficiently than for heating since the peak energy demand closely coincides with the highest solar irradiation.

The concept of Net-Zero Energy in building refers to a building which has an annual balance of energy flow at the utility meter of zero. The concept implies that the building may consume energy from an external provider at times in order to satisfy the building demands, but at other times it must produce enough on-site energy to compensate for this energy. The use of renewable energy technologies is implicit as the source of energy to compensate for any energy used from an external provider. Solar photovoltaic is a proved technology for achieving Net-Zero Energy building but economic factors has limited its broad use. The design stage of a solar photovoltaic project is critical to make a project feasible. In the design stage, the equipment sizing must be optimized in order to reduce the initial capital cost and, therefore, improve the economics of the project. For houses, which is the focus of this paper, a stand-alone solar photovoltaic system must supply the house energy demand at all times since it is not connected to the electric grid. As a means to size the system, data of solar energy availability must be used to ensure that the system will provide enough energy to satisfy the energy demand as well as provide energy to charge the batteries that will provide the energy required when the solar energy is not available. In this paper, a methodology to optimize the size of the photovoltaic array and the battery bank is proposed. The methodology accounts for Typical Meteorological Year data (TMY3) to ensure that the system, based on accepted statistical data, will be able to satisfy the energy demand at all times.

SAC systems present a good alternative for reducing this consumption. Solar cooling systems are environmentally friendly as they use water and lithium bromide solution as the working fluid. The purpose of this work is to undertake a sensitivity analysis to identify parameters which have a significant influence on the SAC systems performances. The sensitivity analysis has been carried out on numerical models developed at the PIMENT laboratory and validated using RAFSOL experimental data (experimental plant is set up at the IUT in St-Pierre).

This paper describes the thermal performance of a new low-cost solar thermal micro-concentrating collector (MCT), which uses linear Fresnel reflectors, and is designed to operate at temperatures up to 220 \u00b0C.

Economics are discussed using a comparison of photovoltaic vapour-compression cooling against solar thermal cooling with an absorption chiller and a grid-connected reference chiller. A sensitivity analysis is presented including electricity price and PV panel cost. It was found that at current conditions (\u20ac0.12/kWhel) the PV-based cooling (PVS) has a lower cost than the solar thermal cooling system (STAC). The PVS system however has a higher cost than the REF system until the electricity price reaches \u20ac0.21/kWhel, then the PVS system has lower lifetime cost. Secondly, a solar thermal cooling system does not break even with a grid connected chiller until an electricity cost of \u20ac0.34/kWhel. Further, this paper discusses the current potential of energy and greenhouse gas savings by using alternative solar air-conditioning technologies. Market barriers and opportunities for solar driven air-conditioning systems in Europe are presented.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3035601834"}}

One of the main issues in incorporating weather dependent sustainable energy sources such as solar- and wind power, into the electrical grid, is the irregularity of power production. The peak hours of power consumption in society, rarely coincide with the peak hours of generation of sustainable energy. The full potential of sustainable energy sources is therefor seldom utilized. In this concern, solar thermal collectors are quite problematic. The need for heating and hot water is largest during the least radiant parts of the day \u2013 in the morning, evening and during the night. Most residential solar thermal collectors are connected to large water tanks, in which hot water is stored. These can however, rarely cover an entire households' heating needs, and are most often only used to cover hot water needs. The problem is even more obvious when observing the difference in the heat required and heat generated for an average danish house (built in the 1990's) during an average year, using 25 m2 of solar thermal collectors. Our hope is to prove, that it is possible create a system, which stores large quantities of surplus heat from daytime hours - and from periods with very varying weather conditions, which is more effective than systems using water as a heat storing medium. This is possible by utilizing phase changing materials, which can contain large amounts of latent heat energy, as mediums of heat storage. Using large tanks of for instance lauric acid (which is a naturally occurring lipid that melts at app. 44 oC) could potentially store approximately 2,5 times more usable thermal energy than equivalent water tanks. These tanks would be able to store some of the excess heat energy during peak hours, and provide heat energy when it is needed. In effect, a system such as this could be able to store more energy than water, thereby reducing the amount of wasted heat energy, available during peak hours, considerably. These systems could be effective in areas with large consumptions of residential hot water, such as Scandinavia, or in areas with very varying temperatures, such as deserts, mountain regions etc, ultimately making solar thermal collectors a more viable source of residential heating, reducing the amount of fossil fuels used for heating.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2601939513"}}

Places of large potentials of sustainable energy production and places of energy consumption are often very different and separated by large distances across the globe. This paper first discusses potentials of solar technology in terms of global availability using PV technology and actual energy production. Solar energy is widely under-used and one way to reduce this is to improve production in low-energy places with high demand: large cities. According to this option, about 40% of the electricity consumption in the built environment could be produced by solar PV systems. To reach this goal appropriate solar PV energy conversion devices and energy storage systems are needed. This paper discusses conditions in the built environment and functional and design qualities enabling an increased diffusion of the technologies. In a comparative analysis of PV technologies, the criteria taken into account encompass efficiency of the type of solar cell and commercial availability. Special attention is paid to the design features of different PV systems, like flexibility, colour and transparency that might help in their utilization as integrated in building material and ornaments in modern architecture.

Parameters studied include geometric shapes of individual units, their density in a neighborhood, and the site layout. The plan shapes of the housing units included in this study are rectangles and several variants of L shape. Site layouts studied are characterized by a straight road, a south-facing or a north-facing semi-circular road. Rectangular units and a site layout with straight road serve as reference for evaluating the effect of shape and site parameters. Results indicate that a significant increase in total electricity generation (up to 33%) can be achieved by the building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems of housing units of certain shape-site configurations, as compared to the reference. The energy load of a building is affected by its orientation and shape. Increased heating demand by L variants (by up to 8%) is more than offset by annual electricity production of their BIPV systems (by up to 35%). Heating and cooling loads depend significantly on unit density in a site; Attached units require up to 30% less cooling and 50% less heating than detached configurations of the same site. Variation of surface orientation, particularly in curved site layouts, enables the spread of peak electricity generation over up to 6 h. This effect may be beneficial to grid supply efficiency.

It is an onsite-distributed power source, offering advantages of size and scale variability, modularity and building integrability.

The operation of these plants, however, releases carbon dioxide and contributes to the problem of climate change. Furthermore, many of these countries rely on imports for their energy needs and the purchase of fossil fuel weakens their financial potential. Unlike hydrocarbon energies, renewable energy can be developed from resources which are constantly replenished and will never run out. These energies include: \uf0b7 Solar Power which utilizes the energy from sunlight either indirectly or directly. It can be used for heating and cooling, generating electricity, lighting, water desalination, and many other commercial and industrial uses. \uf0b7 Wind Power which captures the energy of the wind through wind turbines. \uf0b7 Biomass Energy which uses the energy from plants and plant-derived materials, such as wood, food crops, grassy and woody plants, residues from agriculture or forestry, and the organic component of municipal and industrial wastes. \uf0b7 Geothermal Energy which utilizes the heat from the earth, drawn from hot water or steam reservoirs in the earth\u2019s mantle located near the earth's surface. \uf0b7 Ocean Energy which traps thermal energy from the sun\u2019s heat and mechanical energy from the tides, underwater currents and waves. \uf0b7 Hydropower which captures the energy from flowing water to power machinery and produce electricity", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1589659852"}}

In this context, the BIPVs integration with the building envelope limits the costs by serving dual purposes. BIPVs have a great advantage compared to non-integrated systems because there is neither need for allocation of land nor stand-alone PV systems. This study seeks to outline various commercially available approaches to BIPVs and thus provides a state-of-the-art review. In addition, possible future research opportunities are explored. The various categories of BIPVs may be divided into photovoltaic foils, photovoltaic tiles, photovoltaic modules and solar cell glazings. Silicon materials are the most commonly used, and a distinction is made between wafer-based technologies and thin-film technologies. In addition, various non-silicon materials are available.

Gains by the heat pipe are not lost during cloud cover or periods of low irradiation. Simplified thermal resistance-based computer models were constructed to simulate the performance of direct gain, indirect gain, and integrated heat pipe passive solar systems in four different climates. The heat pipe system provided significantly higher solar fractions than the other passive options in all climates, but was particularly advantageous in cold and cloudy climates. Parametric sensitivity was evaluated for material and design features related to the collector cover, absorber plate, heat pipe, and water storage tank to determine a combination providing good thermal performance with diminishing returns for incremental parametric improvements.

Efficient heat rejection is crucial for the overall primary energy balance of sorption systems, as it dominates the auxiliary energy consumption. Low ratios of cooling power to auxiliary electricity of 3.0 or less are still common in sorption system, so that the primary energy efficiency is not always higher than for conventional compression chillers. Whereas dry heat rejection systems require electricity for fan operation, hybrid or wet cooling systems in addition need pumping energy for the cooling water and the water itself. The energy efficiency can be improved for heat rejection to the ground, where only pumping energy is needed for the geothermal heat exchange. Dynamic simulation models were used for a single effect absorption chiller powered by solar thermal collectors via a hot storage tank. The chiller models were coupled to a three dimensional numerical ground heat exchanger model or to cooling tower models. The models were validated with operating data of a 15 kW solar cooling system installed in an office building. Primary energy efficiency ratios were determined for different heat rejection systems and improved control strategies were developed. The installed system primary energy ratios varied between 1.1 and 2.2 for auxiliary heating and between 1.2 and 2.5 for auxiliary cooling depending on the heat rejection and control strategy chosen. The low electrical energy consumption of the geothermal heat rejection saves 30% of auxiliary electricity and results in an electrical coefficient of performance of 13.

Chilean energy policy goals attempts to promote efficiency and sustainability in the energy system. These objectives have been considered in recent modifications to the electricity generation laws by establishing that generation companies must reach a quota of up to a 10% from renewable energy sources by 2024. Concentrated solar power (CSP) is an interesting alternative to help achieve those objectives, as it is estimated that northern Chile has high radiation levels, coupled with the high values of the local clearness index and flat land availability. However, from the sustainability point of view it seems necessary to assess if a CSP plant is effectively an energy source. Here we propose a hybrid solar power plant lifecycle model which through a net energy analysis obtains and analyzes the plant energy sustainability attributes such as net energy, energy return over investment and energy payback time. The stages of construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning are considered in the lifecycle analysis. The model is then applied in order to determine good locations where to install a CSP plant in the Chilean Atacama Desert. Monthly means of solar radiation are used in order to estimate the solar fraction for a 100MW direct steam generation parabolic trough collector plant. The results indicate that solar power plants are effectively a net energy source for the analyzed locations, and that higher energy costs are related to the fossil fuel backup lifecycle. A relation is established between yearly radiation, energy return over investment and energy payback time. It is estimated that the net energy analysis is a useful tool for determining under which conditions a power plant becomes a net energy source and therefore a more convenient option from the sustainability point of view, and thus can be utilized in order to define best geographical locations and operation conditions for different renewable energy sources. The sustainability attributes are greatly enhanced when considering a solar-only operation mode, which highlights the advantages of using that configuration, and presents a case for the use of thermal energy storage systems rather than fossil fuel hybridization if a constant or dispatchable energy profile is required.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2008143888"}}

PVs are a truly elegant means of producing electricity on site, directly from the sun, without concern for energy supply or environmental harm. They represent a favorable case: easy and fast installation, low maintenance requirements and the ability to produce electricity on site within the urban built environment. In that sense, there is a growing consensus that PVs for individual buildings, known as building integrated or applied PVs (BIPVs or BAPVs, respectively), will be chief among the continuously widespread distributed PV applications. Still, they suffer from the disadvantage of their very high initial cost compared to other renewable and conventional energy technologies, although this has been steadily reduced during the last 5 years. It is therefore evident that without the support of suitable instruments, the expansion of solar electricity worldwide would not take place at a satisfactory pace. Various effective support mechanisms have been adopted, within which feed-in tariff (FiT) proved to be the most successful for PVs.

Peak electricity demand has been an issue in the Desert Southwest region of the US, due to extreme summer temperatures. To address this issue, a consortium was formed between the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Pulte Homes, and NV Energy. An energy efficient residential community was developed by the team in Las Vegas with approximately 200 homes to study substation-level peak reduction strategies. A summer peak reduction of more than 65%, between 1:00 PM and 7:00 PM, compared to code standard housing developments is the targeted goal of the project. Approximately 50 homes are already built and some are occupied. The energy performances of the homes have been monitored and are presented in this paper. Several peak electric load reduction strategies such as energy efficiency in buildings, roof integrated photovoltaics (PV) and direct load control have been applied. Though all the homes in the developed community are installed with 1.8 kWp PV systems, the orientation of the PV system depends on the building orientation. Focus of this paper is to find the impact of PV orientation on the peak load from a building. In addition, different time-of-use (TOU) energy pricing options are offered by the local electrical utility company. Hence it is important to find an optimal pricing option for each building. A computer model has been developed for one of the homes in the new development using building energy simulation code, ENERGY-10. Calculations on the PV orientations have shown that a south and 220\u00b0 (i.e. 40\u00b0 west of due south) orientations are economically optimal for homes enrolled to flat electricity pricing schedule and time of use pricing respectively. As predicted by the simulations, the energy efficiency methods in the home have decreased the total annual energy by 38% compared to a code standard home of the same size. Further, the energy efficiency methods in the building coupled with a 220\u00b0 oriented PV and 1.1 \u00b0C increase in thermostat temperature for three hours (from 3:00 to 6:00 PM) reduced the peak energy demand by 62% compared to a code standard building of the same size.

PV penetration in LV networks will certainly heighten in the coming years since BIPV will not only add aesthetic value to the buildings but users could actually sell the power produced back to the utility through the newly introduced Feed-in Tariff (FiT) in the country.

Parking lots in asphalt-rich cities have great solar potential because the panels can be oriented to maximize power production during summer afternoons when electricity is most valuable. Solar-powered parking lots can mitigate the substantial increase in peak-hour energy demand that major developments create, but few developers now install solar canopies over their parking lots. Although the demand for electricity peaks on days when the sun shines brightest, solar power accounts for less than 1 percent of our total electricity supply. How can cities increase power production from parking lots? They can incorporate solar power into their off-street parking requirements. Cities already specify a minimum number of parking spaces for every building, the minimum size of the spaces, and their landscaping. Cities could also specify that a share of these spaces be covered with solar panels to meet the increased peak-hour power demand created by new buildings. The rationale for requiring solar power in a parking lot resembles the rationale for requiring the parking lot itself. Because new buildings increase the demand for parking, cities require parking spaces to meet this demand. Similarly, new buildings increase the demand for electricity during peak hours, and a solar requirement for the parking spaces will help to meet this demand.

Parking lots in asphalt-rich cities have great solar potential because the panels can be oriented to maximize power production during summer afternoons when electricity is most valuable. Solar-powered parking lots can mitigate the substantial increase in peak-hour energy demand that major developments create, but few developers now install solar canopies over their parking lots. Although the demand for electricity peaks on days when the sun shines brightest, solar power accounts for less than 1 percent of our total electricity supply. How can cities increase power production from parking lots? They can incorporate solar power into their off-street parking requirements. Cities already specify a minimum number of parking spaces for every building, the minimum size of the spaces, and their landscaping. Cities could also specify that a share of these spaces be covered with solar panels to meet the increased peak-hour power demand created by new buildings. The rationale for requiring solar power in a parking lot resembles the rationale for requiring the parking lot itself. Because new buildings increase the demand for parking, cities require parking spaces to meet this demand. Similarly, new buildings increase the demand for electricity during peak hours, and a solar requirement for the parking spaces will help to meet this demand.

The aim of this paper is to study which of these two solar combisystem designs is suitable for different houses. The thermal performance of solar combisystems based on the two different heat storage types is compared. Design/methodology/approach The thermal performance of Low flow bikini solar combisystems and high flow tank\u2010in\u2010tank solar combisystems is calculated with the simulation program TRNSYS. Two different TRNSYS models based on measurements were developed and used.

The aim of the present thesis is the analysis of a grid connected photovoltaic system, which generates all its produced electrical power to the grid and has a nominal power of 100 kWp. In nowadays there is a significant rise in photovoltaic investments and the immediate future is expected to be more auspicious.  In the first chapter, there is a brief presentation of the global, European and Greek situation in the section of electricity generation.  In the second chapter, a detailed analysis of the photovoltaic technology is presented. There is a description of the materials and technologies used to manufacture solar cells. Moreover, the electrical properties of cells and modules are explained in detail and also the factors affecting their efficiency.  In the third chapter, the main parts of a photovoltaic system are presented in detail.  In the fourth chapter, there is a theoretical economic analysis. Specifically, basic economic terms are explained and tools for investment assessment are given.  In the fifth chapter, there is a detailed technical study of a grid connected photovoltaic system. All the electrical and mechanical equipment is concerned (pv modules, inverters, wiring, groundings, electrical protection equipment etc). Moreover, the annually produced electrical energy is being estimated.  In the sixth chapter, an economic study is presented and the economic sustainability of the investment is investigated.   In the seventh chapter, we use the program PSCAD in order to simulate and analyse the photovoltaic system in the computer. Firstly we analyse each part of the photovoltaic system separately and afterwards we compose all these parts together and we analyse the whole system. The system\u2019s response in normal operating conditions, the impact of changes in solar radiation and in cells\u2019 temperature, the harmonics and lastly the system\u2019s response in rapid change of solar irradiance, are all studied in this chapter.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W16377914"}}

To develop indigenous alternative and renewable energy resources, long-term subsidy programs (1986\u20131991 and 2000\u2013present) for solar water heaters have been enforced in Taiwan. By the end of 2010, the total installed area of solar collectors had exceeded 2 million square meters. However, over 98% of solar water heaters were used in residential systems for hot water production, with the areas of installed solar collector being less than 10 square meters. There were only 98 systems with area of solar collectors installed exceeding 100 square meters put into operation from 2001 to 2010. These systems were mainly installed for water heating in dormitories, swimming pools, restaurants, and manufacturing plants. In the present study, a comprehensive survey of these large-scale solar water heaters was conducted. The objectives of the survey were to assess the system performance and to collect feedback from individual users. It is found that lack of experience in system design and maintenance are the key factors affecting reliable operation of a system. Hourly, daily and long-term field measurements of a dormitory system were also examined to evaluate its thermal efficiencies. Results indicated that thermal efficiency of the system is associated with the daily solar radiation.

The conversion efficiency of solar cells depending on incident angle of light is important for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) applications. The quantum efficiency is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy shining on the solar cell. The analysis of angle dependence of quantum efficiencies give more information upon the variation of power output of a solar cell by the incident angle of light. The variations in power output of solar cells with increasing angle of incidence is different for the type of cell structures. In this study we present the results of the quantum efficiency measurement of single-crystalline silicon solar cells and a-Si:H thin-film solar cells with the angle of incidence of light. As a result, as the angle of incidence increases in single-crystalline silicon solar cells, quantum efficiency at all wavelength (300~1,100 nm) of light were reduced. But in case of a-Si:H thin-film solar cells, quantum efficiency was increased or maintained at the angle of incidence from 0 degree to about 40 degrees and dramatically decrease at more than 40 degrees in the range of visible light. This results of quantum efficiency with increasing incident angle were caused by haze and interference effects in thin-film structure. Thus, the structural optimization considering incident angle dependence of solar cells is expected to benefit BIPV.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1896134508"}}

This paper presents the life cycle impacts of the Solaire BIPV and extrapolates its performance to other fa\u00e7ade systems. Engineering diagrams, detailed material inventories and 5 years of irradiation and actual performance data in 15\u2010min intervals offer insights into current BIPV construction and performance. The Solaire BIPV employs waste\u2010stream monocrystalline silicon wafers. Correspondingly, zero energy input was allocated to this BIPV from wafer production, resulting to a very low energy payback time (EPBT) and global warming potential burden (0.8 years and \u221210.2 g CO 2 /kWh, respectively). A negative EPBT results from subtracting the impact of the thermally and structurally equivalent concrete and brick wall that the BIPV array replaced. Data from current photovoltaic\u2010dedicated Si wafer supply were also used; these resulted with an EPBT of 3.8 years and a global warming potential of 61 g CO 2 /kWh. The performance ratio and EPBT of the Solaire system were compared with those in the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Task 2 inventory database. The drawback of fa\u00e7ade BIPV is its vertical orientation, receiving lower incident irradiation than rooftop and ground installations. Nevertheless, BIPV offers two main advantages over such installations: it does not require any \u2018virgin\u2019 land for its operation, and it replaces structural units, thus avoiding the cost, embodied energy and corresponding emissions related to those. We detail herein how the replacement of traditional cladding materials can offset the performance drawback of BIPV, in terms of environmental burden and EPBT.

For the last two decades, economic development in Reunion Island has led to major structural changes. The latter have been characterized by an increase in energy demand per person. This demand is mostly related to a high population growth (1.55% per year). Reunion currently has 833,000 inhabitants. The population will rise to 1 million in 2030. Like most ultraperipheral regions of the European Union, Reunion is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels for its energy production. The total primary energy consumption amounted to 1352 ktep in 2009 and 87.1% is imported energy. The development of various renewable energies such as solar energy, biomass, ocean energy, etc. is thus of priority concern to aim to achieve energetic independence. Just like other French overseas territories, Reunion policies have widely invested in Renewable Energy Sources (RES) since 2000. This paper aims at presenting the current status, the major achievements of policies and the future objectives in the deployment of renewable energy programmes.

Integration of rooftop PVs in residential networks at moderate penetration levels is becoming a reality in many countries including Australia. However, the detrimental effects associated with the high penetrations levels of rooftop PVs are not fully explored to most power utilities. It is expected that the sophisticated structure and communication backbone of smart grid allow easy, safe and reliable integration of these distributed renewable energy resources at very high penetration levels in the residential networks populated with smart appliances. However, it could take several years before smart grid infrastructure is ready to support high perpetrations of distributed generations. Therefore, until smart grid communication becomes available, utilities need to explore how present-day residential networks will cope with the fast installations of rooftop PV systems. In particular, the burden on local distribution circuits such as transformers and cables, which are the critical links in distribution systems, must be investigated in the presence of PVs. This paper carries out an analysis into the impacts of rooftop PVs at different penetration levels on the performance of distribution transformers and residential networks. Such operation may lead to an overall reduction in the reliability and economy of future smart grids.

The proper sizing of the components of an active solar system is a complex problem that includes both predictable and unpredictable parameters. Predictable parameters are related to the performance characteristics of the collector and other components, and the unpredictable parameters mainly concern weather data (solar radiation, ambient temperature, wind speed, and direction). In the second part of this chapter, various design methods are presented as well as an overview of the simulation techniques and programs suitable for active solar heating and cooling systems. The design methods presented include the f-chart and utilizability methods. For more detailed results, modeling and simulation is used. The software programs described briefly in this chapter include F-chart, TRNSYS, and WATSUN.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2205589997"}}

The scientific evidence of climate change as a result of greenhouse gas emissions is becoming increasingly obvious. Arguably, fossil fuels are the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. In South Africa, more than 90% of the electricity is generated from fossil fuels and the building sector contributes about 23% of greenhouse gas emissions. The Integrated Resource Plan of 2010 envisages a 16% renewable energy contribution to the Country\u2019s energy mix and a 30% reduction in ghg emissions by 2030. This paper highlights South Africa\u2019s climate change situation and discusses the application of renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency measures in the residential sector as a means of mitigating climate change. A case study of a prototype energy efficient solar house that was designed and built at the University of Fort Hare is presented. The house has passive solar features, a solar water heater for hot water supply and a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) generator that supplies electrical power to the household appliances. An automated data acquisition system comprised of an outdoor weather station and a datalogger was installed. Thermal and electrical performance of the building integrated photovoltaic generator and indoor and outdoor ambient conditions were monitored. Energy performance data recorded over a year revealed that the energy efficient solar house has the potential to mitigate 12.41 tonnes of CO2e per annum.

In the time when the world is debating on climate change issues which is basically due to use of fossil fuel, the use of solar energy in various form is relevant. The existing buildings are responsible for use of large amount of energy for lighting, heating, cooling and use of various energy run equipments mostly powered by fossil energy. Today\u2019s intention should be to replace this fossil fuel by solar energy which is free and available in abundance.At the moment, solar technologies in the form of photovoltaics and thermal collectors are available in competitive prices. However, their use has not been to the expectation specially in building sector to replace the use of fossil fuels. The main reason for these technologies not being popular in building integration is the lack of good architectural quality rendered not meeting desired design considerations. Innovative approaches have to be explored in terms of design and implementation in order to match the modern technological components to the scale, proportion, material, colour scheme and balance of buildings. So, the objective of this thesis is to pave possible ways of integrating these technologies into buildings, both on existing and new constructions to add emphasis on the overall architectural expression in addition to producing energy. The intention here is to highlight design possibilities regarding the use of solar technologies into buildings with innovative approaches. Basic focus is on the appearance or aesthetics part of integration as this makes the major impact on the people. PVs and thermal collectors can deliberately be used as architectural design elements in a distinctive way.The development towards passive house, zero energy and zero emission buildings will cause a more frequent use of building integrated solar energy systems as a source of renewable energy. Due to the limitations in the integrability of such systems in relation to the design, colour and scale of the building envelope, their integration may ruin the final architectural quality of the building. Many solar systems do exist on the market, and with better and better energy performance. But, if they are not designed to be integrated into buildings to enhance the quality of architecture, probably no one will opt using these systems as a source of renewable energy generators. In this case, even though there will be more and more efficient PV or STC systems in the market, they won\u2019t be of use if aesthetic ways of integrating them is not sought. It looks like PV integration have brought about some improvements in the architectural quality of building integration, but the solar thermal collectors lacks on this part to some extent.While the technical development and energy performance improvements are always in progress, the actual use of these systems in buildings is not increasing as it could and should do. Existing buildings account for over 40% of the world\u2019s total primary energy use and 24% of greenhouse gas emissions (Wall, 2009). A combination of making buildings more energy-efficient and using a larger fraction of renewable energy is therefore a key issue to reduce the non-renewable energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. With this aim, integration of PV and solar thermal collector systems into buildings becomes very important.Integrating these PV and solar thermal collectors systems into buildings is not only for clean energy but also to use them as multifunctional elements where they replace the conventional building elements. With this, the economical viability of integration is met and most importantly, they become architectural components.So the possible ways of architectural integration of PV and solar thermal collector systems have been explored and analysed in the thesis with special focus made on the aesthetic part of integration. \u2018Integrability\u2019 of both the systems in terms of different integration requirements have been compared. In doing so, integration advantages of both the systems have been explored.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W260339341"}}

This work consists of three scientific journal articles on the subject building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), and was initiated by a student project work which consisted of a major revision and extension of an article on BIPVs (appendix A). BIPVs are photovoltaic materials that replace conventional building materials in parts of the building envelopes, such as the roof covering or facades. BIPV systems may represent a powerful and versatile tool for achieving the ever increasing demand for zero energy and zero emission buildings of the near future. In this respect BIPVs offer an aesthetical, economical and technical solution to integrate solar cells harvesting solar radiation to produce electricity within the climate envelopes of buildings. Firstly, this work summarises the current state-of-the-art of BIPVs, including BIPV foil, tile, module and solar cell glazing products (article 1). Secondly, this work addresses possible future research opportunities and pathways for the BIPVs of tomorrow (article 2). Thirdly, this work illustrates challenges linked to the building envelope properties of a BIPV system, and attempts to develop and evaluate relevant methods for testing the building envelope properties of BIPV systems (article 3). Based on this, a sample roof area with two BIPV modules was built and inserted in a turnable box for rain and wind tightness testing of sloping building surfaces with the purpose of investigating the rain tightness of the BIPV system, and observing how it withstood wind-driven rain at large-scale conditions. The BIPV sample roof went through testing with run-off water and wind-driven rain with incremental pulsating positive differential pressure (overpressure) over the sample at different inclinations. The BIPV sample roof was during testing constantly visually monitored, and various leakage points were detected. In order to prevent such water penetration, the steel fittings surrounding the BIPV modules should ideally be better adapted to the BIPV modules and constricted to some extent. It is however important to maintain a sufficient ventilation rate simultaneously.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W171022122"}}

Increased standards of living and indoor comfort demands have led to an increase in the demand for air-conditioning in buildings in South Africa. Conventional vapor compression systems use refrigerants that damage the ozone layer and contribute significantly to the global warming effect. Therefore, there is an urgent need to implement environmentally cleaner ways of satisfying this air-conditioning demand and absorption cooling systems have shown great potential to do so. This project is concerned with finding the technical and economic effectiveness of solar powered absorption cooling systems for South African climatic conditions. Solar cooling systems are made up of a solar collector array, water storage tank, absorption chiller and cooling tower for heat rejection. In this study, two complete systems, one utilizing an open wet cooling tower and another using a dry cooler were studied and their technical and economical performance analyzed. One system was installed at Netcare Moot Hospital in Pretoria and comprised of a solar collector array made up of 52 evacuated tube collectors, two 6000litre hot water storage tanks, 35kW LiBr-water absorption chiller, and a wet cooling tower. This system was coupled to an existing vapor compression chiller so that cooling is provided even when no solar energy is available. The installation controlled and remotely monitored through the internet and parameters logged through a Carel Building Management System. The other system is at Vodacom World in Midrand, Johannesburg and is an autonomous solar heating and cooling system aimed at maintaining the building environment at comfort conditions throughout the year. It is made up of a 116m evacuated tube collector array, a 6500litre hot water storage tank, 35kW LiBr-Water absorption chiller, 1m of cold water storage, a dry cooler for the chiller, and two underground rock storages to pre-cool the supply air to the building and the dry cooler respectively. Long term system performance studies were carried out by varying the system control strategy for the chiller, hot water storage tank, existing vapor compression chiller (in the case of the Moot Hospital installation) , hot water storage tank, dry cooler ( for the Vodacom installation) and the system Coefficient of Performances were calculated and life cycle cost analysis carried out. Due to the fact that solar availability and cooling demand are approximately in phase, solar powered absorption cooling presents a great opportunity for reducing peak electrical cooling energy", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1516689408"}}

The target for this assignment was to design a concept for a new line of unique and notable solar-light products. The new products had to be designed for a not yet existing brand which would extend the clients lines of 12 volt products with solar products. Because there was no target group defined at the start of the assignment, a plan of aproach was set up including researchquestions that would lead to a clear description of the target group. This description was used as starting point for the design. Also there were research questions formulated to explore the technical aspects. During the market research the products of the client; products of competitors and the current trends on garden and lighting were analysed and aspects like light effect, material, price range, application and function of the lamps were taken into account. The results were later presented to the client and in consultation a description for the target group was defined. The choices made were later substantiated with an external research from \u201cDe Tuinbranche Nederland\u201d and lead to the creation of a moodboard to visualise the group in mind. After this market research it was necessary to figure out the measurements, adjustable parameters and overall functioning of the (electrical) components. This was done by talking to the engineer at Techmar B.V. and consulting numerous sources and previously carried out studies. Also the technical specifications of the electronic components of some existing lamps were compared to get a solid support for the choice of components to be used in the new, yet to design, lamp. This technical research resulted in a design brief with requirements and wishes the new lamp had to meet. After the research phase was finished a form study started where several ideas were put on paper or in the computer. These sketches were then later grouped and presented during a meeting where both the client and UT-mentor were present. Resulting from this meeting and a discussion about the numerous sketches was a choice for the idea that would be further developed. During these developments an idea from the client about adding a dynamic element to the lamp was taken in to account, and several concepts were designed and later presented. It turned out that the moving components were difficult to realize in the current concept and eventually the lamp was further developed without the dynamic element. After the design of this lamp was finished, the process of designing three \u2018family\u2019 products, that could be presented together, was started. After another shape study 3 lamps were developed that fitted the first design. These new designs added 2 floor lamps and a smaller table lamp. The first model was engineered to the point of production ready but yet to optimalize 3D CAD model. With the other models, production was taken into account but the 3D CAD models were less far developed. All of the models were eventualy presented as renders that look as realistic as possible. With this de client has a concept that can be presented to sales or marketing departments.

Arriving in Cambodia in the first week of the new year I was picked up by one of the students already working for Kamworks. A nice and comfortable way to get your first impressions. The first 3 months of my internship I lived in the Solar Campus, very basic housing powered by solar energy. While the showering with a little bucket took some getting used to the life in the province was very nice. We had a fun group and worked together on our separate projects. I started my internship designing molds for the solar home system. The designs were send for manufacturing to Vietnam and I could pick them up some time later. A working trip to Saigon, an always welcome distraction and my first experience with the full blown craziness of south east Asia. From the iron mold we made the plastic molds for the Solar Home System and we pulled some nice quality products from the molds. It\u2019s a very good feeling to see that the things you design on your computer work out in practice. Kamworks advocates itself as a green company, but when arriving in the morning the slow stokes of the diesel generator can be heard from behind the building. A solution had to be found and with 40 donated solar panels some concrete and steel my next project was born. The next couple of months we worked hard in the burning sun to construct a solar roof to make Kamworks a true self supplying, green company. We dug deep foundation holes, poured concreted welded steel and constructed roof framing, a dream of every mechanical engineer. And the good thing here in Cambodia; no building permits required. You got the steel you got the tools, you can start building. The result was a fully operational solar array which can be spotted with Google earth. The last months I spend reviving a shelved project namely the Solar TV. A product with high potentiality since the people here in Cambodia all seem to want a cheap but good solution for watching TV. Since the solar TV runs on 12V it can work with the widely used car batteries and can also work together with the Solar Home System.

Solar photovoltaics (PV) have become an increasingly important part of the global energy landscape over the past several years. As jurisdictions around the world continue to encourage the deployment of PV systems, module costs have plummeted and vastly improved the competitiveness of PV. As a result, the PV market has grown immensely, reaching $93 billion in global revenues and surpassing 29GW of installed capacity in 2011. The total global capacity of PV installations now exceeds 69GW, with fairly robust growth expected in the future. However, prominent bankruptcy and restructuring cases point to the fact that the PV industry has entered a turbulent phase. As the market continues to mature and government support is ratcheted down, consolidation is expected to intensify and firms will need to innovate even more aggressively in order to succeed. Governments, attempting to promote industrial development, salvage fledgling domestic PV industries, and deploy clean energy systems, are now faced with navigating the challenges and opportunities presented by this rapidly shifting industrial landscape. It is within this context that innovative PV designs and technologies are emerging and prompting discussion around future system designs and appropriate policy support. Building-integrated PV (BIPV), in particular, is attracting increasing attention as a promising niche for further investment and development.This policy insight paper considers the public interest grounds for supporting the development of a Canadian BIPV industry. More precisely, this paper presents an overview of societal benefits relating to this technology as well as opportunities and challenges to deployment and industrial development. We conclude by providing broad policy insights for the development of an appropriate national strategy for unlocking the potential of BIPV.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2254110930"}}
