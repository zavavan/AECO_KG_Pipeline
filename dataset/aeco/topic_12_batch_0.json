Managing deep renovation projects is challenging due to the interactions with their surroundings, the issues of limited access and space, and the uncertainty around the composition and conditions of existing buildings. The interplay between the building areas, the building elements involved in the deep renovation, and the renovation scenarios and activities present challenging situations for managing safety risks. Research on enhancing safety in building projects using digital approaches such as BIM has mainly focussed on new construction works, yet limited research is available for deep building renovation projects. Using a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, this paper develops an ontology for representation and identification of hazards in deep building renovations, instantiates the ontology through the development of a digital tool, and demonstrates its usefulness in hazard representation and identification by performing tests with real industry data from deep renovation projects, as part of a Horizon Europe 2020 research project, called RINNO. The testing involved a multi-residence apartment case study and three different renovation scenarios and successfully demonstrated the ability to automatically identify potential hazards relating to a particular renovation strategy. While the proposed ontology can be used to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries in building retrofit projects, its main implication is in laying the foundation for future digitally enabled approaches for managing safety in building renovation projects.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391116287"}}

To address this issue, this study focuses on the research of lifting operation information management based on Dynamo. By integrating BIM, Dynamo and mobile information management servers, a comprehensive system for managing prefabricated component lifting operation information is created. First, the paper elaborates on the detailed process of prefabricated component lifting operation information management based on Dynamo, covering the construction preparation stage and the lifting construction stage. Subsequently, Dynamo is utilized to develop programs for information input and processing, component sorting, and component coding and QR code generation. Furthermore, a mobile information management server is employed to build an information management application. By scanning Dynamo-generated QR codes, workers can access basic information about components, as well as upload construction and quality inspection data. Furthermore, this application facilitates information sharing and real-time data collection. Finally, this method is tested in a case study involving the lifting operation of composite slabs.

Several approaches to deal with this issue were investigated in the manufacturing area, among which this paper looks at the holonic approach as one of the most promising strategies. This study first analyzes the more fragmented and dynamic nature of the construction industry as compared with the manufacturing one. Secondly, it suggests developing a process-based holonic construction management system based on building information modeling (BIM) and a conceptual architecture for manufacturing control called Product Resource Order Staff Architecture (PROSA). The process-based paradigm ensures exploiting the benefits of BIM towards the development of sustainable and efficient regeneration methods of the built environment. Subsequently, a first management system prototype was developed and tested for the purpose of renovation works management.

Likewise, several academic and research initiatives are reviewed. In this sense, this paper aims to establish an appropriate link between two agendas that the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, academia, and governments normally handle separately. By conducting several literature reviews (book, journals, and congresses) and extensive software tests (BIM software: Revit v2023, Archicad v27, Tekla, and wood plug-ins: AGACAD, Archiframe, Timber Framing 2015, WoodStud Frame, etc.), the state-of-the-art was assessed in both fields, and several cases linking BIM and wood are shown in detail and discussed. Various theoretical samples are modelled and shown, and the advantages and disadvantages of each technique and stage are explained.

Furthermore, since the appearance of materials such as steel and reinforced concrete, all software developments have focused on these materials, leaving aside the possibility of developing applications for use in wood projects. According to that previously discussed, it can be concluded that BIM for wood has been used more frequently in academia, that both fields have several common processes, and, in many cases, that only a few BIM-wood tools have been used, thus disregarding the high potential and high level of benefits that result with the application of these methodologies for the complete building life cycle (design, construction, and operation).", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4392041939"}}

The construction industry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is a significant sector in the Middle East, with annual expenditures exceeding USD 120 billion. It employs 15% of the workforce and consumes more than 14% of the country\u2019s energy resources. Despite the significant growth in the Saudi construction sector, it faces various challenges due to the rapid launch of mega projects, such as the Line project engaged with the NEOM project, as well as other new projects as part of the Saudi Vision 2030. The challenges might be limited to a shortage of skilled labourers, rising costs, construction disputes, and material shortages. This study aims to investigate claims management procedures under traditional practice and compare them with a proposed BIM package as an alternative solution to mitigate construction disputes. The objective of the study focuses on reducing the time consumed when analysing claims against the level of accuracy of claims values. The proposed BIM model improves and streamlines the claims process through automation. This study presents prospective and retrospective methods in delay analysis under an accepted programme. A questionnaire survey was conducted, and out of a total of 123 practitioners, 79 replied. The findings in tables in this article reveal that there are demands and a growing awareness of BIM in the KSA construction industry.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is extensively used in the construction industry due to its benefits throughout the Project Life Cycle (PLC). BIM can simulate buildings throughout PLC, detect and resolve problems, and improve building visualization that contributes to the representation of actual project details in the construction stage. BIM contributes to project management promotion by detecting problems that lead to conflicts, cost overruns, and time delays. This work aims to implement an effective BIM for the Iraqi construction projects\u2019 life cycle. The methodology used is a literature review to collect the most important factors contributing to the success of BIM implementation, interview the team of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) building, and strive to improve the BEP of the CBI building.

Purpose Previous studies have established to a great extent that regulatory frameworks and, in particular, procurement approaches \u2013 that are common in a particular context \u2013 have a major impact on the success of building information modelling (BIM) implementation in construction projects. Despite the close links between these two concepts, research on the effect of procurement approaches on BIM implementation is scarce. To address this gap, this paper aims to investigate the barriers that affect BIM implementation through the lens of procurement approaches. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method approach was adopted using a questionnaire survey ( n = 116) and interviews with key stakeholders ( n = 12) in Jordan. The outcomes of the quantitative parts were augmented with findings from interviews. Findings It was revealed that the deployment of unfavourable construction procurement approaches represents a major hurdle towards BIM implementation. Though essential for enhancing BIM implementation, it is revealed that a fundamental change from the common design-bid-build (DBB) to more collaborative procurement approaches remains infeasible in view of the realities that govern the construction industry.

In this sense, this paper aims to establish an appropriate link between two agendas that the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, academia, and governments normally handle separately. By conducting several literature reviews (book, journals, and congresses) and extensive software tests (BIM software: Revit, Archicad, Tekla, and Wood plug-ins: AGACAD, Archiframe, Timber Framing 2015, WoodStud Frame, etc.), the state-of-the-art was assessed in both fields, several cases linking BIM and wood are shown in detail and discussed, various theoretical samples are modelled and shown, and the advantages and disadvantages of each technique and stage are explained.

Abstract Companies in the construction sector need effective information management. In particular, the transmission of information within a company is key to improving its management and competitiveness. Currently, many companies in the construction sector are making a great effort to implement the building information modelling (BIM) methodology. Such implementation requires collaborative work through the Cloud between the different agents in the construction process of any project. In fact, information management in BIM projects is related to the creation, storage, transfer and efficient application of information within a three-dimensional (3D) virtual model of the project. The size of the project also determines the optimal management approach. The main problems resulting from poor information management may be a lack of coordination between actors, loss of information or misinterpretation of information. This work has two stated objectives. The first objective is to carry out a literature review of the applications of BIM technology and the importance of managing knowledge according to International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)- 19650. The second objective is to propose a disruptive method based on the Kanban tool to properly manage BIM information in the design and construction phases.

Firstly, the advantages of BIM based 3D computing were introduced. Subsequently, BIM based structural seismic analysis was proposed, and the structural analysis model based on Revit software was formed simultaneously with the creation of the structural geometric model. While creating the geometric model, the analytical model automatically connects at the nodes. The process of creating a geometric model is carried out in the order of layer by layer construction from low to high in the actual construction project.

ABSTRACTThe need to foster a strong relationship in the construction industry is vital due to the level of dependency among stakeholders in the sector. The social CRM system has been deployed as a relationship tool in most sectors, but its infusion in the construction industry is not resounding. Hence, the study investigates the barriers to Social Client Relationship Management application in fostering sustainable relationships among construction stakeholders. It models the relationships between the associated barriers between the client and the construction organisations affecting the implementation of social CRM systems. A quantitative research approach was adopted, and a face-to-face questionnaire survey was conducted on 200 construction experts selected from 40 construction projects in Lagos Island. The targeted construction experts were elicited for the survey using purposive sampling techniques. Data from the survey were analysed using SPSS 21 data analytics techniques like frequencies and percentages. Also, the study used SmartPLS (v.3.2.3) to develop the structural model. Findings from the study revealed a strong relationship between the significant factors associated with the clients and construction organisation hindering Social CRM system implementation in the built environment. The findings can assist built environment stakeholders in developing strategies to control the factors associated with the client and construction organisation militating against Social CRM implementation in the construction industry.KEYWORDS: Clientconstruction organisationPLS-SEMconstruction businessmodelbuilt environment Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4389009256"}}

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is now a widely accepted tool in the construction industry for designing and managing construction projects. However, converting a BIM model from one type of structure to another can be challenging. This case report aims to document the problems and challenges encountered when an engineer team attempted to create a precast concrete structural BIM model from an architectural BIM model that was initially designed to use a post and lintel system. The architect worked with the engineer team, facing several challenges when changing the structural system. One of the main challenges during the conversion process was redesigning structural elements as the structural behavior of the building changed significantly. The architectural layout and design of the building had to be altered to accommodate the new structural system. Additionally, the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems had to be planned for installation within the precast concrete structure. These changes required significant effort and coordination between the different teams involved in the project. In conclusion, the case study demonstrates that converting a BIM model from one type of structure to another can be a challenging task that requires significant effort, coordination, and planning. It also shows that BIM models are not just a design tool but also a powerful tool for construction management and coordination.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4388943436"}}

Building design is a broad and intensive collaborative process that involves a multitude of tasks and responsibilities that need to be accomplished in a timely and qualitative manner. The design process has a clearly expressed iterative nature - each solution is initially raised as a hypothesis, which is further discussed, analysed, calculated, checked, including compliance with normative requirements, and then final decisions are made after analysing several possible alternatives. This takes place in each team (discipline) of the project participants by comparing analysis results and anticipating the possible impact of decisions on the solutions and results of other design teams (disciplines). Therefore, it is very important to coordinate, synchronize, reconcile, and manage these decision making iterations in a collaborative environment. The Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology encourages the development of harmonized information production and management processes, creating preconditions for real collaboration between design partners in a unified model (the prototype of real building) environment and enables this model to be used for multivariate virtual testing. This feature is realized through the integration of modelling and analysis and computing systems, when the data transfer from one system to another system ensures the connection between the physical and the analysis model and the integrity of their data.

Purpose The implementation of smart maintenance (SM) has greatly benefited facility managers, construction project managers and other stakeholders within the built environment. Unfortunately, its actualization for stakeholders in the built environment in the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) era remains a challenge. To reduce the challenge, this study aims at conducting a bibliometric analysis to unearth the critical success factors supporting SM implementation. The future direction and practice of SM in the construction industry were also explored. Design/methodology/approach A bibliometric approach was adopted for reviewing articles extracted from the Scopus database. Keywords such as (\u201csmart maintenance\u201c) OR (\u201cintelligent maintenance\u201d) OR (\u201ctechnological maintenance\u201d) OR (\u201cautomated maintenance\u201d) OR (\u201ccomputerized maintenance\u201d) were used to extract articles from the Scopus database. The studies were restricted between 2006 and 2021 to capture the 4IR era. The initial extracted papers were 1,048; however, 288 papers were selected and analysed using VOSviewer software. Findings The findings revealed that the critical success factors supporting the implementation of SM in the 4IR era are collaboration, digital twin design, energy management system and decentralized data management system. Regarding the future practice of SM in the 4IR era, it was also revealed that SM is possible to evolve into maintenance 4.0. This will support the autonomous maintenance of infrastructures in the built environment. Research limitations/implications The use of a single database contributed to the limitation of the findings from this study. Practical implications Despite the limitations, the findings of this study contributed to practice and research by providing stakeholders in the built environment with the direction of SM practice. Originality/value Stakeholders in the built environment have clamoured to implement SM in the 4IR era. This study provided the critical success factors for adopting SM, guaranteeing the 4IR era. It also provides the research trends and direction of SM practice.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4387704694"}}

The introduction of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is changing the work environment in the AEC industry. Many countries require the AEC industry to submit building documentation using BIM. For example BIM is a requirement to obtain funds the from European Union (EU); England, Dubai and California also require BIM for some typologies of building projects, and most countries are moving towards BIM as a must. It is therefore necessary to introduce BIM into the Architecture, Construction and Engineering curricula. These skills, abilities and methodology will increase student opportunities.&#x0D; Nowadays each institution and faculty introduces BIM in its own way as there is very little scientific literature about how to go about it. There are many proceedings about offering introductory BIM courses and documentation of those experiences, but few scientific publications are available, as there are for the introduction of new information management processes applied in other fields of science.&#x0D; This educational research aims to be a first step to create a BIM introduction framework providing scientific data. For this thesis we focused on the introduction of BIM based on Autodesk products in the construction courses of the United Arab Emirates University. Whereas in Spain architectural curricula is broad spectrum, in the UAE, US and many other countries the architect is not overseeing the structure, MEP and HVAC, and must rely on engineers; this study of BIM is based on the fact that the design and construction processes of a building are multidisciplinary work and coordinated by many different professionals, therefore BIM is the right tool.&#x0D; In the course of our research we have studied student academic performance, motivation and satisfaction using surveys, comparison of exercises, grades and student interviews, as well as the feedback of the professors. The analyzed data helped us to determine introduction problems, behaviors to avoid, and elements to take into account when introducing BIM-Revit in construction courses. This thesis ends with the evaluation of two different methodologies to introduce BIM in construction courses and a first step towards a BIM introduction guide.&#x0D; In future studies from this research we will expand the study to other universities, starting with the American University of Ras Al-Khaimah (RAK) and working further to extend it further through the members of the Academic for Interoperability Coalition (AIC). We will also participate in other BIM introduction studies from the AIC research group, and based on our initial work here will develop a research project to create a guide for BIM implementation in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction curriculum. La implantaci\u00f3n del \u201cBuilding Information Modelling (BIM)\u201d en la industria de la construcci\u00f3n, es una realidad que esta cambiando el sistema de trabajo.

Este es el caso de todos los proyectos financiados con fondos p\u00fablicos UE, o Inglaterra, Dub\u00e1i y California, y una seria recomendaci\u00f3n en muchos otros. Es por tanto necesario que los alumnos de las Escuelas de Arquitectura o Facultades de Ingenier\u00eda de la Construcci\u00f3n, o grados equivalentes dispongan de las competencias y habilidades que esta metodolog\u00eda comporta para conseguir una f\u00e1cil incorporaci\u00f3n al mercado laboral.&#x0D; Nos encontramos en un momento en que cada centro, introduce BIM a su modo, con diferentes metodolog\u00edas, intensidades y con muy poca literatura cient\u00edfica, dado que estamos hablando en primer lugar de una herramienta, pero en el fondo es una nueva manera de gestionar toda la informaci\u00f3n que gira alrededor de los procesos de dise\u00f1o, construcci\u00f3n y mantenimiento de los edificios y ello depende mucho de cada caso particular y las personas que lo gestionan.&#x0D; En todo caso podemos encontrar referencias a experimentos docentes equivalentes a la hora de introducir nuevos procesos de gesti\u00f3n de la informaci\u00f3n aplicada en otros campos de las ciencias, pero muy pocos al del BIM.&#x0D; Este trabajo de investigaci\u00f3n educativa pretende ser un primer paso para la creaci\u00f3n de una estrategia de implantaci\u00f3n de BIM, aportando datos cient\u00edficos sobre los problemas que nos encontramos al introducirlas.

We are at a stage where Building Information Modelling (BIM) has reached a maturity level to be widely adopted by the professionals and organizations within the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. An industry which is highly fragmented and not advanced in terms of digitalization, making an effective collaboration hard to achieve. The advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have brought about the promise of improving collaborative procedure in a wide range of industries. The widespread adoption of BIM has paved the way for the introduction of ICT within the AEC sector. The reported benefits of BIM imply on its potential for contributing to a successful inter-disciplinary collaboration. This calls for attention from architects who shall consider how BIM allows the architectural practices to operate in truly novel ways to achieve new building efficiencies and organizations. This research was designed to investigate the crucial factors for an effective collaboration based on advanced ICT and enabled by BIM with respect to architectural practices. An effective inter-disciplinary collaboration allows architects as the authors of the projects to oversee the development and delivery of the projects more consistently with their design intends. The concerns about the move towards adopting BIM by architectural firms were reviewed and its influential factors and barriers were discussed. As we read about it, BIM is indicated by different terms to describe its essence: \u2018\u2019BIM methodology\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019BIM technology\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019BIM process\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019BIM systems\u2019\u2019 and etc. However, none of these terms can include all aspects of BIM. The term \u2018\u2019ecosystem\u2019\u2019 was adopted to describe the nature of BIM and the reason for which is described in this work. To further constitute the BIM ecosystem, its dimensions of People, Products and Processes were presented in detail with respect to collaborative procedures. It included the delineation of a number of BIM policies and protocols, tools and technologies, roles and skills which are all related to and suitable for architectural practices in their interdisciplinary collaboration. Through three case studies, the research questions and hypothesis were put into investigation. Based on the idea of change management and the socio-technical nature of BIM collaboration, a qualitative research approach was adopted. Various techniques were used to gather information to be analyzed through a coding process of the qualitative data. The codes were interpreted as the factors influencing collaboration and were grouped to form the crucial concepts contributing to effective BIM-enabled collaborative procedures. It was revealed that the \u201cjoint decision making\u201d factor is the most crucial one in this respect followed by \u201ccollaboration involvement\u201d and \u201cinteroperability\u201d. These findings were based on the frequency of the codes related to these factors in the data analysis. The crucial concepts in BIM-enabled collaboration were revealed to be \u201ccollaboration conditions\u201d followed by \u201csoftware capacity\u201d and \u201chuman resources organization\u201d. The findings confirm the research hypotheses that BIM implementation asks architects to assume a leadership role in collaborative procedures and that it allows for the integration of ICT into the technological pipeline of architectural practices. However, the validity of the two hypotheses is subject to certain conditions that are discussed in this work. The research finds the area of BIM education a place of great interest for future research work as the factor of \u201ctraining\u201d has a great influence on the overall success of BIM-enabled collaboration. Furthermore, it was revealed that the crucial factor of \u201cinteroperability\u201d needs more attention from both industry and academic sectors. The impacts of BIM implementation on existing and emerging roles within the industry is another area of great interest for future works and research. Estamos en una etapa en la que Building Information Modeling (BIM) ha alcanzado un nivel de madurez que ser\u00e1 ampliamente adoptado por el Profesionales y organizaciones dentro de la industria de Arquitectura, Ingenier\u00eda y Construcci\u00f3n (AIC). Una industria que es altamente fragmentado y no avanzado en t\u00e9rminos de digitalizaci\u00f3n, lo que hace que una colaboraci\u00f3n efectiva sea dif\u00edcil de lograr. Los avances en las Tecnolog\u00edas de la Informaci\u00f3n y la Comunicaci\u00f3n (TIC) han tra\u00eddo la promesa de mejorar la colaboraci\u00f3n Procedimiento en una amplia gama de industrias. La adopci\u00f3n generalizada de BIM ha allanado el camino para la introducci\u00f3n de las TIC en el sector de la AIC. Los beneficios reportados de BIM implican en su potencial para contribuir a un \u00e9xito interdisciplinario colaboraci\u00f3n. Esto requiere la atenci\u00f3n de arquitectos que deben considerar c\u00f3mo BIM permite que las pr\u00e1cticas arquitect\u00f3nicas operen en formas verdaderamente novedosas para lograr nuevas eficiencias de construcci\u00f3n y organizaciones. Esta investigaci\u00f3n fue dise\u00f1ada para investigar los factores cruciales para una colaboraci\u00f3n efectiva basada en TIC avanzadas y habilitado por BIM con respecto a las pr\u00e1cticas arquitect\u00f3nicas. Una colaboraci\u00f3n interdisciplinaria efectiva permite a los arquitectos como autores de los proyectos para supervisar el desarrollo y la entrega de los proyectos de manera m\u00e1s coherente con sus prop\u00f3sitos de dise\u00f1o. Se revisaron las preocupaciones sobre el movimiento hacia la adopci\u00f3n de BIM por parte de las empresas de arquitectura y sus factores influyentes y Se discutieron las barreras. A medida que leemos sobre esto, BIM se indica mediante diferentes t\u00e9rminos para describir su esencia: \"metodolog\u00eda BIM\", \"Tecnolog\u00eda BIM\", \"Proceso BIM\", \"Sistemas BIM\" y etc. Sin embargo, ninguno de estos t\u00e9rminos puede incluir todos los aspectos de BIM. El t\u00e9rmino \"ecosistema\" se adopt\u00f3 para describir la naturaleza de BIM y la raz\u00f3n por la cual se describe en este trabajo. A m\u00e1s constituyen el ecosistema BIM, sus dimensiones de Personas, Productos y Procesos se presentaron en detalle con respecto a procedimientos colaborativos. Inclu\u00eda la delineaci\u00f3n de una serie de pol\u00edticas y protocolos BIM, herramientas y tecnolog\u00edas, roles y habilidades que est\u00e1n relacionadas y son adecuadas para las pr\u00e1cticas arquitect\u00f3nicas en su colaboraci\u00f3n interdisciplinaria. A trav\u00e9s de tres estudios de caso, las preguntas de investigaci\u00f3n y la hip\u00f3tesis se pusieron en investigaci\u00f3n. Basado en la idea de cambio. La gesti\u00f3n y la naturaleza sociot\u00e9cnica de la colaboraci\u00f3n BIM, se adopt\u00f3 un enfoque de investigaci\u00f3n cualitativa. Varios se utilizaron t\u00e9cnicas para recopilar informaci\u00f3n para analizarla a trav\u00e9s de un proceso de codificaci\u00f3n de los datos cualitativos. Los codigos fueron interpretados como los factores que influyen en la colaboraci\u00f3n y se agruparon para formar los conceptos cruciales que contribuyen a la eficacia procedimientos colaborativos habilitados por BIM. Se revel\u00f3 que el factor de \"toma de decisiones conjunta\" es el m\u00e1s crucial en este sespeto seguido de \"participaci\u00f3n colaborativa\" e \"interoperabilidad\". Estos hallazgos se basaron en la frecuencia de c\u00f3digos relacionados con estos factores en el an\u00e1lisis de datos. Los conceptos cruciales en la colaboraci\u00f3n habilitada por BIM se revelaron como \"Condiciones de colaboraci\u00f3n\" seguidas de \"capacidad de software\" y \"organizaci\u00f3n de recursos humanos\". Los hallazgos confirman la investigar las hip\u00f3tesis de que la implementaci\u00f3n BIM les pide a los arquitectos que asuman un papel de liderazgo en los procedimientos de colaboraci\u00f3n y que permite la integraci\u00f3n de las TIC en la l\u00ednea tecnol\u00f3gica de las pr\u00e1cticas arquitect\u00f3nicas.

To scientifically improve the application possibilities of intelligent construction, it is necessary to identify and analyze the key factors influencing its application to prefabricated buildings. This study presents the overall functional architecture of an intelligent construction system for prefabricated buildings and identifies 19 parameters of four aspects from the prefabricated buildings life cycle. To identify the key factors and causal relationships, Decision-Making trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is employed, in conjunction with Interpretive Structure Modeling (ISM), to construct a multilevel progressive structure model that also clarifies the action pathways of these factors. The feasibility of the proposed methodology has been demonstrated through case analysis.

Conservative methods of developing projects for internal power supply systems of buildings and constructions of various functional purposes, to which various CAD systems can already be safely attributed, have been proven to be an effective tool for processes automation of creating and issuing project documentation, but not properly linked between various sections of technical solutions. Due to such a significant lack and the emergence of innovative technologies for creating digital models of buildings and constructions, the problem of developing an approach to the formation of projects for various engineering systems in the BIM environment (Building Information Model or Modeling) becomes relevant. This environment, previously used to develop predominantly architectural and constructive solutions, now allows creating digital twins of various elements for technical systems in the volume necessary for construction and operation. Due to the fact that these elements are equally detailed both geometrically and parametrically (the object is not a conditional geometric primitive, but is endowed with all the necessary physical properties appropriate to a real element), it is possible to form a full-fledged digital model of the engineering system for a building or construction by actions aimed at creating relationships between digital elements according to a certain principle. The most popular software for developing design solutions within the framework of BIM technologies is currently Revit software from Autodesk, which is the developer of the world's most popular CAD solution -AutoCad.

Conventional construction work has many weaknesses, so it takes the role of technology in the construction sector to make it more effective and efficient. This research focuses on implementing a management method in the construction industry, namely Building Information Modeling (BIM). Where this study aims to determine the volume of work (Quantity Take Off) of the structure, the duration of the 3D simulation of the work (Time Schedule), and the estimated budget. This study uses the simulation method (simulation research), where direct modeling is carried out using Autodesk Revit 2023 software for 3D and 5D BIM, as well as 4D scheduling using Microsoft Project 2020 and Autodesk Naviswork 2023 software. In the analysis process, this research requires detailed engineering design drawings, time schedules, and work unit prices. The results of this study indicate that the volume of concrete work is 4898.71m\u00b3 with an estimated cost of IDR 7,172,372,614.68 and for reinforcement volume of 1136750.2 kg with an estimated cost of IDR 18,615,421,275.20 with a total estimated structure work of IDR 25,787,793,889.88. The duration of the work obtained on the 4D BIM model is 289 days.

Introduction. Information modeling of buildings and structures (BIM) implies comprehensive examination of an object including studying engineering, technological and economic information about a building and all interrelations and 42 dependencies it has [1\u20132]. Such approach enables considering a building and all things referring to it as a single facility.Information modeling is an important tool to be used at various stages of the project implementation, including the design and construction stage [3]. Information modeling is used at each life cycle stage of a facility, including the investment stage, construction itself, and commissioning, which envisages maintenance of a building and management of the assets. Having the information model at this stage is a great advantage for the company managing a facility, due to reduction of the costs arising from the operational shortcomings. The aim of the research was to develop the facility\u2019s operation stage model in the information environment, as the most expensive stage of a building life cycle and supplement it with the calculation of the need-for-repairs indicators.Materials and Methods. During the research the data-analytical environment \u201cInformation and Analytical System for Housing and Communal Services\u201d (IAS \u0416\u041a\u0425) for forecasting the technical state of a constructed facility was studied. The method of creating the three models of a multi-storey residential building's operation stage at the pre-investment period was applied: a building undergoing natural depreciation; repairs of the main structural elements directly affecting the existence and functioning of a facility are carried out; regular repairs of all elements are performed.Results. Following the carried-out calculations, a rational model of building operation was approved, based on the period of efficient operation and the cost of repairs during this period.Discussion and Conclusions. The method of the constructed facility operation stage modeling allows examining various scenarios of the building life cycle after its construction and evaluating the relevance of one or another type of operation of a particular facility.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4384827458"}}

Building Information Modelling technology (BIM-T) continues to gain attention. Its adoption creates a platform that allows the built environment professionals to share project information through a common database. At the same time, there is an increased perception that implementing BIM on construction projects will positively influence building production throughout its lifecycle. Recent studies have revealed a low level of BIM implementation in the African construction industry. Currently, the utilisation of BIM for building production has received a significant acceptance rate in developed regions, while in African countries, it is still at an infant stage. Moreover, previous studies have established that BIM application comes with various barriers. These barriers contribute to its low adoption, application and implementation. Nevertheless, there are still some notable benefits and impacts on building production, which have been the main drivers for its continual adoption. Therefore, this study aimed to research BIM-T applications in African countries, focusing on the Nigerian and South African construction industries. The goals are to assess its level of awareness, usage, barriers hindering its application/implementation and benefits accruable with its adoption. BIM impacts the building production lifecycle and determines the strategies to promote its application among construction professionals for sustainable construction in developing countries. To achieve the objective of this research, an extensive review of the literature was conducted on usage, barriers to BIM adoption, application/implementation, benefits of adopting BIM, its impacts on building production, and strategies to promote its application/implementation. A structured questionnaire elicited constructive data from the Nigerian built environment professionals (NIA, NIOB, NIQS, and NSE) and the South African construction-related professionals (SACPCMP). The web-based (Google form) questionnaire was distributed online. According to the distribution among the professionals, 276 and 105 respondents indicated their willingness and availability to participate in the research from Nigeria and South Africa, respectively. The generated data was analysed using the following descriptive measures: mean item score (M.I.S), relative important index (RII), ranking and frequency and quantitative inferential analysis (factor analysis, pairwise comparison, one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis). It was found that there is a significant increase in the level of BIM awareness among Nigerian and South African construction professionals compared to previous findings. 98.55% and 96.19% of respondents, respectively affirmed that they are aware of BIM. Nevertheless, these findings established that there are still BIM-related barriers peculiar to both countries; the top common three barriers are low computer skills among some of the professionals, habitual resistance to change from the traditional style of design and build, and government's unwillingness to support BIM use. These barriers could be responsible for the professional\u2019s low level of BIM tool usage. The study also revealed that all 13 identified BIM benefits are significantly important in both countries. From this, it could be concluded that BIM application has significantly improved the production of buildings through its contribution to performing tasks from building design to post-construction stages. Finally, the respondents identified the need for foundational knowledge in an educational institution on BIM tool use and its applications as a critical area of focus that could assist the promotion of BIM. This study has extensively documented the various research contributions carried out in this study's area of focus. The preliminary survey result concludes that the findings will assist the professional body in making intelligent decisions and adequate measures to advance the adoption, application/implementation of BIM among their members. It will also inform the institutions about what is required from their construction graduates to improve their employability in the industry.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4383554067"}}

Building information modeling (BIM) technologies are used by most foreign and domestic CAD system vendors. At the other stages of the building's life cycle, digitalization has not been widely distributed, despite the fact that the operation stage is the longest and the trouble-free existence of building structures at this stage is the key to the economic and social efficiency of building ownership. Flat rolled roofs in our country are the most common type of roofs and at the same time the most susceptible to defect formation structural element of a building. The standard operation period of such roofs is 10 years, despite the fact that the actual period of trouble-free operation of flat rolled roofs rarely exceeds 7 years. The assessment of the technical condition of the roofs is carried out by a construction and technical expertise, performed, as a rule, after the occurrence of leaks. Assessment of the degree of damage, as well as the prevalence of defects, is carried out by an expert visually, often without the use of measuring equipment. Due to the fact that the assessment of damage by an expert is purely subjective, it is impossible to correctly assess the development of the defect over time. The proposed technology of automation of construction and technical expertise of flat rolled roofs of a building allows timely detection of defects, assess the degree of their danger and make forecasts of their development over time.

The construction industry is currently facing the challenges of intensifying global competition, increasing market volatility, increasing product differentiation, and shortening product life cycles. In this context, versatile production concepts with modular structures promise a better adaptation to these dynamic boundary conditions in terms of quantity production, product variety, and manufacturing location. Modular construction has significant advantages over traditional on-site construction in terms of material efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Therefore, specialized software for building design is one of the critical aspects of modular construction. This work presents the development of an online platform for the design of buildings using modular construction. The main features of this platform are the 2D home design with 3D visualization, using BIM approaches, the validation of architectural rules and system limits taking into consideration the design and legal framework, and the management of orders and workflows for sustainable construction. The validation of architecture rules and system limits allows the use of the platform by final clients to design their houses and obtain the budget and the construction viability based on modular construction.

Abstract A digital twin is the mapping of a physical twin between hybrid spaces. The lifecycle of digital and physical twins occurs through the concepts of foetal, child, and adult twins. This technology can be used to assist clients and designers with real-time data. The use of digital twin technology in architectural design can be realised at various stages, from design to operation. Designers will be able to gain knowledge of the past, present, and future using this technology. This will reveal possible design scenarios. In this study, a hypothetical scenario is designed, in which designers build a building while already having a digital twin template. To do this, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is used as a reference model for digital twins, along with the fidelity levels of digital twins and the level of detail-development of BIM. When designers want to design a new project related to their predecessors, they already use the same type of digital twin-building portfolio they can use for their new design. A digital twin will help optimise the new process. Therefore, the digital twin of a building with a similar building type can be used to extract relevant data for the design process.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4381185618"}}

Since the 1990s, mass timber constructions have become more and more popular. This type of construction has characteristics that are ideal for incorporating building information modeling (BIM). A mass timber structure implies offsite prefabrication at the factory, which generates modeling specificities. Although digitalization and BIM are becoming more and more common, and some studies have focused on BIM for mass timber construction, none of them focus on model checking for mass timber construction. In construction projects, there is still no general method that synthesizes the possibilities offered by BIM-based model checking in general, and research on the conformity of mass timber models in particular is almost non-existent. Our research objective is to provide a general step-by-step method summarizing the process of model compliance study with dedicated tools. To conduct this work, we first solidified our understanding of the problem by interviewing professionals from the mass timber construction industry. Next, we developed our method iteratively, supported by tools, and then validated it with three model-checking case studies. This method consists of five steps: checking the specifications, digital environment implementation, requirement deciphering, calculation, and compliance results\u2019 analysis. We then applied our method in three case studies. The results of the case studies are mixed: some audits were successful, while others were not, because barriers to auditing were encountered (missing information, impossible interpretation of data for the model properties, etc.).

Background: As a result of the rising costs of housing in Kuwait, several families find it increasingly challenging to purchase new homes. Typically, Kuwaitis carry out extensions of the existing housing spaces they possess, to accommodate their growing families. In the management and execution of house extension projects, construction planning and scheduling are complex albeit critical tasks. Building information modeling (BIM) and optimization techniques have become crucial tools for improving these two critical processes. Methods: This study aimed to integrate 4D BIM and multi- objective optimization using a genetic algorithm (MOGA) for construction planning and scheduling of a precast house extension. A case study was undertaken for a two-storey family house in Kuwait, which has been extended by two additional floors using the precast method. The extension of the house has its own foundation and support, with a design that adheres to Le Corbusier&apos;s five points of architecture. The Autodesk Revit software was used to generate a three-dimensional architectural model of the house extension. Results and Discussion: After running the MOGA based on the developed schedule, optimal results were obtained as a Pareto front with 70 combinations across workers&apos; cost and construction time. The preferred schedule was selected and fed into Autodesk Navisworks to generate a 4D BIM model. Navisworks was used to simulate the house extension, accompanied by its scheduling information.

However, PropTech applications are not extensively adopted yet, as many established companies are still doubtful about the added value of a digital transition, which encompasses significant investments.

The aim of the case study was to evaluate the effectiveness of remodelling the existing as-built documentation of a railway construction into a common BIM data environment (CDE), in which further subsequent construction agenda should be managed for the remaining period of its life cycle. Using the documentation for construction realization of the railway station \u0160umice, this 3D documentation was remodeled into the BIM data environment CDE and alternatively also into the 2D GIS environment. The BIM data standard developed by the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure was analyzed during the documentation reworking. An important parameter of the documentation rework was the use of a geodetic reference system fully compatible with the cadastral system in the Czech Republic. It turned out that the general data standard is only partially applicable for railway structures containing many special objects and many objects requiring individual classification. The remodelling of existing graphical data proved faster and more efficient in a GIS environment (layer oriented) compared to the need for 3D remodelling in a BIM CDE (object oriented). Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of remodelling underground technical infrastructure objects, while the visible surface situation is often more effectively captured by current progressive bulk data acquisition technologies.

The station is one of the important assets because passengers must access the station before boarding the train and must leave the station after arriving at their final destination. TTA is a unit that has one of the main tasks, namely collecting data, recording, validating, evaluating and controlling data on the Station Building assets. The main challenge in implementing an asset management strategy for buildings lies in the many types of assets that must be analyzed and categorized. Therefore, by adopting digital tools such as BIM, practitioners can improve the consistency of building information, computing capabilities, and coordination capabilities in managing assets. In the early stages, LOD is needed to determine the number and level of building information that needs to be placed in the BIM Model.The topic that will be presented in this paper is about proposing an LOD framework for station buildings managed by BUMN PT. Kereta Api Indonesia so as to improve the quality of asset management. Based on the research results, LOD contains 2 (two) key levels to identify a station building so that the resulting information becomes more structured when we want to build a BIM model. The first level is a component that is divided into several indicators such as roof components, walls, floors, doors, windows, ventilation, platforms, overcaping, rails, lighting and plumbing. The second level is elements which are divided into several descriptors such as geometry, position, dimensions, type, elevation, material, and finishing. So this paper proposes the LOD level to be applied to BIM so that it can explain station buildings from a simple model (LOD-S.KA. 0) to a detailed model (LOD-S.KA.4)", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4388910628"}}

Since the Korean government has decided to apply the policy of BIM (Building Information Modeling) to the entire construction industry, it has experienced a positive trend in adoption and utilization. BIM can reduce workloads by building model objects into libraries that conform to standards and enable consistent quality, data integrity, and compatibility. In the domestic architecture, civil engineering, and the overseas landscape architecture sectors, many BIM library standardization studies have been conducted, and guidelines have been established based on them. Currently, basic research and attempts to introduce BIM are being made in Korean landscape architecture field, but the diffusion has been delayed due to difficulties in application. This can be addressed by enhancing the efficiency of BIM work using standardized libraries. Therefore, this study aims to provide a starting point for discussions and present a classification system for objects and attribute information that can be referred to when creating landscape libraries in practice. The standardization of landscape BIM library was explored from two directions: object classification and attribute information items. First, the Korean construction information classification system, product inventory classification system, landscape design and construction standards, and BIM object classification of the NLA (Norwegian Association of Landscape Architects) were referred to classify landscape objects. As a result, the objects were divided into 12 subcategories, including \u2018trees\u2019, \u2018shrubs\u2019, \u2018ground cover and others\u2019, \u2018outdoor installation\u2019, \u2018outdoor lighting facility\u2019, \u2018stairs and ramp\u2019, \u2018outdoor wall\u2019, \u2018outdoor structure\u2019, \u2018pavement\u2019, \u2018curb\u2019, \u2018irrigation\u2019, and \u2018drainage\u2019 under five major categories: \u2018landscape plant\u2019, \u2018landscape facility\u2019, \u2018landscape structure\u2019, \u2018landscape pavement\u2019, and \u2018irrigation and drainage\u2019. Next, the attribute information for the objects was extracted and structured. To do this, the common attribute information items of the KBIMS (Korean BIM Standard) were included, and the object attribute information items that vary according to the type of objects were included by referring to the PDT (Product Data Template) of the LI (UK Landscape Institute). As a result, the common attributes included information on \u2018identification\u2019, \u2018distribution\u2019, \u2018classification\u2019, and \u2018manufacture and supply\u2019 information, while the object attributes included information on \u2018naming\u2019, \u2018specifications\u2019, \u2018installation or construction\u2019, \u2018performance\u2019, \u2018sustainability\u2019, and \u2018operations and maintenance\u2019.

Abstract The aging population is growing drastically all over the world. With the advent of the global era, universal design is garnering considerable interest, as the number of multicultural families is increasing, and various user classes are being created. In addition, with the advances in construction technology, architectural design is becoming more diverse, and convenience facilities are also getting distributed in various ways. As a result, more buildings need to apply universal design, indicating that various architectural information and universal design for the user class are required. Various data are needed for universal design evaluation, but there is a limit to evaluating with two-dimensional (2D) drawings. However, the limitations of 2D drawings can be overcome via building information modeling (BIM) combined with architectural data, which remarkably simplifies the universal design evaluation. This study was conducted with the aim to analyze architectural information by extracting architectural elements necessary for universal design evaluation from BIM data. It was confirmed that the calculations for universal design evaluation can be performed by 3D shape or attribute analysis using BIM data and computer programming. In order to create an automated evaluation algorithm for universal design, the evaluation methods were classified according to the universal design evaluation guide, based on building users and user diversity. In addition, even if the evaluation methods were the same by location, different points were classified by location, and evaluation items and information necessary for the evaluation were organized by category for each facility. Through this classification, we created an algorithm with seven types of methods for extracting the BIM data and comparing them by evaluation method for an automated analysis. In addition, an analysis was performed directly on the BIM design sample model using an automated evaluation algorithm. Although there were various architectural objects in the design data, evaluation was possible using algorithms. By applying the universal design evaluation and BIM data evaluation methods, we could confirm that the BIM-based universal design automation evaluation method prevents human error and is thus superior to the existing evaluation methods. Further, the automation evaluation method can contribute to BIM activation as the BIM data can be used in various studies such as design certification evaluation and automation analysis.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4323349506"}}

Considering the significant amount of time and money wasted yearly in fixing errors caused by miscommunication and inadequate information on project sites, relaying the knowledge of field experts through design software may reduce communication-based conflicts in projects. This study aimed to create a model to integrate human field expertise in the construction process with building information modeling (BIM) software. This study is based on the premise of the significance of human involvement in construction. Basement construction in Fargo, North Dakota, was the construction scenario selected for scrutiny in this study. Surveys and in-person interviews were conducted with local contractors to ascertain valuable recommendations and views on basement construction in Fargo. Information from these contractors was coded into models to offer warnings and recommendations on the assessed basement construction activities to help architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) professionals with design, planning, and other processes required before and during construction. Combining BIM (with all its proven strengths) with the human aspect of construction will significantly improve the construction process, especially in decision-making and risk mitigation.Practical ApplicationsThe models developed in this study can be a valuable asset to any construction personnel involved in planning, design, and other preconstruction processes. The models provide users with location-specific recommendations on building activities. Possession of this specialized knowledge can improve the decision-making process for risk mitigation.

In recent years, Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology has developed rapidly in the engineering architecture industry in China because of its great influence in enhancing efficiency and quality of design results. Under the trend of digitalization and informatization, landscape designers have also attempted to introduce landscape information modeling into their practical works. However, building BIM models in the landscape is relatively time-consuming and increases the designer's workload, preventing further application promotion. This paper collects problems landscape designers commonly encounter in using BIM software and then discovers, analyzes the reason, and provides plausible suggestions. It discovers that the problems are mainly caused by a combination of the drawing process, information format, and level of detail between professions. It summarises that standardization in the above aspects is necessary for the subsequent development of BIM in landscape architecture.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4318596152"}}

Among them, the structural design of building engineering is the key link of building engineering, and its safety design directly affects the construction quality and service life of the whole building engineering. At present, the fundamental reason for the frequent occurrence of safety accidents in construction projects is not only the ineffective human supervision in the construction process, but also the inability of traditional structural design methods to avoid and predict potential safety hazards in advance, resulting in endless safety design problems. Based on this, this paper will face the structural design stage of architectural engineering and realize the transformation of the structural design mode of architectural engineering with the help of BIM technology.

In the paper, the authors considered a concept for creating a distributed WEB-server based on the language of mathematical logic of Horn\u2019s clauses (Prolog). The built WEB-server allows you to perform logical processing of 3D products created by the designer. The presented concept consists of seven types of servers, four of which are independent of the designed product and three servers that depend on it. Each of the servers implements logic based on the facts and rules of the Prolog language. The purpose of this work is to create a distributed WEB-server for automatic verification and modification of the algorithm for assembling 3D products based on the proposed concept. All interaction between servers occurs through the main server, which makes it possible to ensure the scalability of the system. The general principle of operation: when receiving the algorithm from the client, the main server sends the data to the verification server. Based on the results of its work, either it is transferred back to the client (if verification was successful or modification is impossible), or it is transferred to the modification server. Also, the verification server uses a database server of available assembly parts, which makes it possible to determine the possibility of modification. The modification server transforms the assembly algorithm in accordance with the rules received from the verification module. The result of the modification module is sent to the client. This approach allows parallel processing of several clients at the same time, identifying them by the header in the packets that are transmitted between servers. An example of the implementation of a self-modification module for transforming the sequence of operations when assembling a 3D structure is presented.

In the modern construction and survey industry, BIM technologies are becoming an integral part of the production process. BIM technologies include: 3d design, information modeling (IM) of existing objects and process control. When creating a BIM model, as a rule, information about aboveground structures is used, less often aboveground and underground objects, and in some cases aboveground, underground objects and a geological 3d model. The close integration of BIM into the industry has a positive effect at all stages ofproject implementation, which is expressed in reducing the time, cost and improving the overall quality of work. Such a trend leads to an increase in the number of software products that support activities in the BIM environment, which, however, may cause the problem of choosing the most optimal software that meets all the needs of the user within his professional tasks. In the Russian market, geologists and designers use a fairly large number of programs for building volumetric engineering and geological models and transmitting this information to the project.

In the construction project, the temporary work is the construction work, which is installed temporarily for the construction of main structure and removed after its completion. Even though it is a temporary facility used and demolished only during the construction phase, it accounts for about 10% of the total construction cost. In addition, it is an important work directly connected to the cost and quality of construction, so that the completeness of the building depends on the technology of the temporary work. Therefore, it is necessary to manage it through systematic quality inspection activities. In order to perform a systematic quality inspection, it is essential that detailed and specific inspection activities, such as inspecting the conformity of the design and construction and its compliance with relevant standards based on construction inspection information, such as drawings, specifications, and checklists, are carried out. However, most of the construction inspection information about the temporary work does not include any specific information in documents (drawings, specifications, etc.). Additionally, the direct temporary work among the temporary works is treated as an auxiliary work of the main structure work in the construction site, although it is the construction work based on the work breakdown structure. Accordingly, the quality control engineer must manually check only the contents of the temporary work among the construction inspection information that covers the overall construction work. Additionally, the probability of human error is increased, as the quality control engineer manually carries out the quality inspection tasks, such as preparing the inspection-related materials and checklist and writing the inspection result report. This leads to inefficiency and problems such as re-provisioning for inspection and re-inspection. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a business process that can efficiently carry out the quality inspection work by complementing and improving the above problems involving the temporary work, which is performed most inefficiently. In this study, a BIM-based quality inspection system prototype for temporary works was developed that can automate tasks and systematically store and manage various types of inspection information for each of the temporary facilities in order to improve the efficiency of the quality inspection carried out by the quality control engineer. As a result, a process designed to improve the quality inspection of the temporary work, which can perform the quality inspection work, is proposed. Additionally, the quality of the works related to quality control is improved through improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of the works and simplification of the existing manual work procedures through the proposed business improvement process.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4308870385"}}

The management of buildings should be efficient during their life cycle, with a sustainable way of considering the new challenges of the Europe Union (EU): resilience and digital transition. Facility management (FM) contributes to achieving these goals, involving multidisciplinary activities and relying on different technologies. The recent concern about an effective digital transition in FM offers an excellent opportunity to improve facility information management in existing buildings through robust data analysis, machine learning, and simulation tools, such as interoperable building information modelling (BIM) platforms. Within this scenario, gathering and structuring in-service information for FM is crucial to boost digital transition in buildings management. This paper discusses the approaches with potential and higher impact in FM and the related steps that should be considered regarding product data template, data collection, and optimisation models.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4311169514"}}

Abstract Prefabrication construction has gained popularity in the construction industry during the last few years. Due to the complexity of prefabrication design, building information modelling (BIM) is adopted in the design stage to improve efficiency and accuracy. Many previous studies have examined the adoption of BIM in the design stage and explored the current practice of BIM adoption in prefabrication construction, however fewer first-hand investigations are made on assessing the adoption of BIM. This study aims to identify the opportunities and challenges of utilizing BIM technology in the design stage of prefabrication construction from the perspective of designers. A semi-structured interview was conducted for qualitative data collection and the data are analysed by thematic analysis. A total of eight designers from Chinese prefabrication construction projects were interviewed. The research identified 8 opportunities and 15 challenges of BIM adoption in prefabrication construction. The top four challenges are: (1) inaccurate prefabrication production drawings generated by BIM software, (2) late adoption of BIM in the design stage, (3) lack of communication platform for different designers, and (4) lack of sharing the updated design model among designers, manufacturers, and onsite engineers. These findings provide directions for improving BIM adoption in the design of prefabrication construction.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4310837994"}}

Abstract: Designers and builders can simulate a physical environment using BIM, a type of digital technology, before starting actual construction. When developing and building things, various disciplines must work closely together. Each discipline is responsible for providing a unique contribution to the overall design. The objects from other disciplines may, however, occupy the same position in space or the same orientation when the incomplete designs are merged known as 'clash'. A collision of this nature is frequently discovered during construction, necessitating a significant amount of extra time and price. To avoid clashes in the final design, early collaboration is essential. BIM automation techniques can do this and perhaps reduce clashes by coordination of 3D Models. A case study that comprised clash detection between architectural, structural, and MEP BIM models was used to conduct the inquiry. The current study used Autodesk Navisworks Manage and Autodesk Revit as BIM tools to design capabilities to streamline and automatically discover clashes. The analysis of the case study data showed that BIM is a useful tool for identifying conflicts between building components. And an investigative study was done to know the reason why these clashes are created during modeling based on the questioners answered by BIM Modelers. The findings emphasize the need for greater transparency in partnerships where designers from varied backgrounds can work on projects simultaneously.

The whole process of building is based on the modular design and assembly idea. The primary structure was constructed using the modular steel buildings (MSBs) concept to suit emergency structures\u2019 functional qualities and quick construction needs. An intelligent operation and maintenance management platform was built utilizing 5G, AI, IoT (IoT), cloud, big data, an d other technologies. A BIM model was created to evaluate and compare the construction plan, develop the combined section and connection node plan, and complete the detailed design of assembled steel structures. On-site modularization of fundamental structural components and accessories is utilized in a flowing operating mode, where the housing and supporting installation are closely coordinated. The research results show that information and data interaction is the key to speedy building design and construction, with digital simulation in one stage and on-site assembly in a crammed way. The study findings may be used to build comparable structures faster, utilizing modular building techniques.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4294958061"}}

Digitalization in the construction industry continues to advance and, together with the increasing dissemination and further development of hardware and software, is steadily opening up further opportunities for innovative ways of working. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is currently becoming the standard for new construction, but has not yet been optimized for use in existing buildings. Therefore, the Institute of Building Materials Research at RWTH Aachen University (ibac) is researching new methods and possibilities for BIM-based building preservation. In this paper, the vision of digitalized building preservation, the state of research so far and the planned further steps are presented. It highlights what information needs to be available in the BIM model for digitalized maintenance planning, and shows how this data can be implemented in a way that is machine-readable and suitable for automated evaluation. The goal is the digital availability and linking of all inspection results, so that various operations such as lifetime prognoses or calculation of concrete removal can be performed in the BIM model. The findings to date show that making BIM models usable beyond the planning and execution phase is an essential step for the digitalization of building maintenance and holds great potential for effective building diagnoses and efficient service life management.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4316661945"}}

Recently, housing renovation support has been strengthened to improve the residential environment of elderly households through integrated community care projects. Although the support is mainly concentrated on the disadvantaged in housing, it is evaluated as a desirable effort in terms of reinforcing the welfare system to provide aging residents with housing remodeling support, and revitalizing the housing recycling industry through these projects. However, the housing renovation support has very low accessibility due to the lack of public relation efforts, limited eligibility, and the insecurity and uncertainty of the system. The most efficient way to increase its accessibility can be an approach using actual cases. However, as few cases have been recorded to date and there is a limitation in face-to-face contact with all eligible residents, access via an online virtual experience can be an effective alternative. This study therefore focused on collective housing buildings where the majority of the elderly currently reside and spatial information can be easily acquired. The objectification process used to construct a Building Information Model (BIM) was performed by reflecting the physical obstacles and body functions of the elderly specific to each lifestyle. A simulation system based on this model was established by setting and applying views by space. This would enable the system to generate comparative images of the conditions before and after the construction to enhance the user\u2019s understanding as well as the drawings and details of the construction. Since construction details are also part of object information, estimates can be created by linking them with unit price information.

Focusing on the wood construction industry, BIM is becoming a necessity; this is due to its high level of prefabrication and complex digital procedures using wood sawing machines and sophisticated cuttings. However, the full implementation of BIM is still far from reality. The main objective of this paper is to explore the barriers affecting BIM implementation in the Swedish construction industry. An extensive literature review was conducted to extract barriers hindering the implementation of BIM in the construction industry. Secondly, barriers to the implementation of BIM in the wood construction industry in Sweden were extracted using the grounded theory methodology to analyse expert input on the phenomenon of low BIM implementation in the wood construction industry in Sweden. Thirty-four barriers were identified. The analysis of this study also led to the development of a conceptual model that recommended solutions to overcome the barriers identified to help maximise BIM implementation within the wood construction industry.

Urban planning is a valuable tool for growth control and city development, both to maintain the local urban identity and provide life quality for inhabitants. To regulate it, local governments have defined standards for a proper city\u2019s growth through municipal and detailed urban plans. Such instruments identify a set of rules which constructions and buildings must fulfil for a careful and smooth integration within the urban areas. New projects are required to comply with such rules, and designers must adapt and guarantee that their projects fulfil all the local urban requirements. However, the verification process of construction projects is still a manual procedure and often a time-consuming process, with high possibilities for inaccurate measures. Thus, this paper aims to streamline the verification procedure of construction projects\u2019 code compliance to enhance project design efficiency and save designers time. To do so, the Building Information Modelling (BIM) method will be used through the Dynamo programming software. By creating a Dynamo routine to check the building code and urban plan compliance from Brazilian municipalities, specific BIM models will be automatically analysed to detect and evaluate if it is according to local urban legislation. Results have provided a real-time decision support tool, where designers can assess if their buildings are complying with local urban codes at any time of the design stage, making it easy to innovate and integrate innovative design options, as well as to precisely communicate their buildings\u2019 code compliance.

A building\u2019s functionality and cost are two significant factors affecting its design of spaces. Achieving highest space utilization for building users increases concrete and reinforcement requirements; thus, increases cost. But a building\u2019s floor could have numerous possible space division combinations that satisfy the architectural and functional requirements. It would be inefficient to conduct structural studies and estimate the cost of each of them manually to select the optimal design. The literature shows different optimization approaches for the architectural and the structural aspects of projects. However, there is a gap in the literature in defining the possible integration between architectural and structural limits to reach optimized approaches which will be beneficial for the cost and quality aspects. A conceptual digital framework was developed to present the possible optimization of the structural elements of projects with optimum utilization of the functionality of the architectural design. The purpose of this research is to develop an automated optimization framework for integrating architectural and structural design of buildings to reach optimum utilization of the functionality of the architectural design and savings in the structural design. The developed framework works in a grid system; where users define the overall floor dimension limits, the number of spaces in the floor and the function of each space, the relative proximity of spaces, and the acceptable dimension limits of such spaces. The model then runs evolutionary optimization algorithms to find the optimal architectural (floor plan) and structural (concrete and steel) design of the building with the objective function of minimizing cost. The framework incorporates the solid slabs structural systems in its operation. The framework is developed using BIM Environment which makes it generic and applicable to any architectural plan.

The traditional building code compliance checking process mainly relies on design reviewers to review design documents or models manually. The intensive manual effort needed makes this process time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. Automated compliance checking (ACC) could be a promising upgrade of the traditional manual code compliance checking. With a reduced workload on design reviewers, ACC is cheaper, faster, and immune to human errors. To support ACC, building code requirements need to be represented in a computer-processable format to enable automated reasoning, which will in turn allow an automated assessment of the building design's compliance status with building codes. A major limitation of many existing ACC systems/methods is their limited range of checkable building code requirements. To address that, the state of the art uses pattern matching-based rules to transform building code requirements into computable formats automatically, but the ruleset was developed and tested only on a few chapters of building code requirements. An efficient ruleset expansion method is needed to increase its range of checkable building code requirements at a low cost, to bring ACC systems closer to full deployment. In this paper, the authors proposed a new regulatory information transformation ruleset expansion method for expanding an existing ruleset. This method can expand the range of checkable code requirements of ACC systems without significant manual effort. The proposed ruleset expansion method takes an iterative approach to ensure the generality and validity of new pattern matching-based rules and the quality of information transformation results. The expanded ruleset was tested on generating logic clauses from Chapter 5 of the International Building Code 2015.

The construction industry is the material basis for national economic development. Since the reform and opening up, the construction industry in China has been in a state of continuous expansion to promote economic and social development. However, the traditional mode of building construction in China is rather crude, which not only fails to meet the needs of rapid urban development, but also causes serious environmental pollution and resource shortage. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct relevant technological updates and industrial restructuring to solve these problems, so as to achieve sustainable development. With the advantages of energy saving, low carbon, and short construction cycle, assembled buildings have become a new direction for the transformation of the construction industry. However, China\u2019s assembled buildings are still in the promotion stage, and the technical level is relatively backward. Especially in the construction process, there is a lack of management mechanisms adapted to assembled buildings. Hence, some new technologies need to be introduced to promote the development of assembled construction in China. In recent years, with the increasing popularity of assembled construction in China, the technology of assembled construction has also been improving. Also, the interface between assembled construction and modern technology has become more and more obvious. In particular, the application of BIM and VR technologies has been of great help to the development of assembled buildings. To be specific, the combination of these two technologies allows for better control of all aspects of the construction site, thus making the construction project easier to manage. In addition, the application of BIM and VR technologies can not only improve the efficiency of project management, but also improve the quality of construction of assembled buildings, thereby reducing the environmental pollution caused by construction. As a result, the application of BIM and VR technologies has greatly promoted the development of project management of assembled buildings.

This is due to the fact that the construction project comprises numerous stakeholders, such as consulting firms, architects, engineers, building surveyors, and quantity surveyors, to name a few. AutoCAD(Automatic computer-aided design) is the current technology in use in the construction sector. AutoCAD is a commercial software tool developed by Autodesk for 2D and 3D computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting. Generally, all AutoCAD drawing designs would be exchanged in the form of paper among the stakeholders. The majority of the information they transmit is in the form of documents and drawings. This technique leads to errors because most documents and drawings are in a paper-based format that isn't well-managed, resulting in miscommunication. Because information is one of the most crucial construction components in a construction project, having incorrect information during the construction process could hinder project production.

At the same time, Structural Optimization (SO) has received a lot of attention in the construction industry to reduce material and to enhance structural performance. However, the lack of communication between structural engineer and architect is a well-known problem discussed in the literature. This can lead to inefficient projects, thus increasing cost and time. The purpose of this work, thus, is to understand how SO can be inserted in a BIM project, specifically analysing the information exchanges between architects and structural engineers, to mitigate the problem related to lack of communication. The investigation included a systematic literature review to comprehend the current scientific scenario in these areas. It identified that there is still a research gap related to the adoption of SO to facilitate the communication between architects and structural engineers in a BIM environment. To help answer this question, an Information Delivery Manual (IDM) structure was developed which maps the information flow to connect architects and engineers through SO in a BIM environment, aiming to optimize the information exchanges. By applying the methodology to three experiments of increasing complexity, the proposed framework proved to improve the collaboration issue beyond other project benefits, such as reduction of material consumption, improvement of sustainability indexes, and structural performance.

The end product of efficiently applying industrialisation to the construction domain is not a completed building but an Industrialised Building System (IBS): a set of integrated parts & tools where the same standardised details & processes are configured to generate individualised buildings. Four strategies are available to meet such a standardised and individualised paradox: Flexibility of the product, Flexibility of the tool, Multipurpose framework and Combinability. Building Information Modelling (BIM), which serves as a catalyzer for innovation in the otherwise notoriously conservative construction industry, offers the appropriate platform to implement those strategies in symbiosis with IBS. Giving a new, positive impulse to the off-site fabrication, it supports the four strategies for individualisation by providing unambiguous communication among all project stakeholders, simulation of manufacturing processes, and solution space exploration to customers.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4293087802"}}

The domain area of the article is buildings life cycle, where the object of research is the formalization of technologies for automating the construction objects life cycle. The processes of the life cycle stages are technologically different, and if the general purpose of the project documentation content is to create a safe, healthy and comfortable living environment for people, then the main semantic attribute of the life cycle stages is the activity of decision makers on the management of these processes. Their activities are always object-oriented and supported by appropriate technologies at all stages. The structure of stages in the life cycle of buildings and structures contains various domain areas of activity for these specialists. The article proposes the development of a methodology for constructing automated technologies for managing of the construction objects life cycle stages, based on the practical application of the Markov algorithms theory conclusions, formulated as a Constructive Direction. This Direction asserts that any virtual or material object always has a Constructive Process implementing it. \"Digitalization\" as the basis for \"Big Data\" collection and accumulation, \"artificial intelligence\" as the rules for generating constructive objects, business processes automation as the practical implementation of for Constructive Process technologies and particular construction objects generation, are based on the concept of Constructive Direction. It is proposed to formally represent any automated Constructive Process (K-process) as the structure of a generative grammar model. Based on the formulated conceptual and methodological approaches for the lifecycle stages, a schematic diagram for building of automated K-process technologies models is proposed. This will reduce risks and costs, increase the development efficiency of lifecycle automated technologies.

For a decade the construction industry has been on its all-time low in productivity due to its lack of adaptability to the digitization of society. In comparison, the manufacturing and production industries have been able to successfully integrate computer applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT) into their processes. As a result, their economic progression has received a significant uplift. Digitization and automation in the construction industry is a relatively young sector with a lot of opportunities for research and innovation. An excellent instrument for surveying resources and operations is a digital environment for monitoring the construction supply chain management framework (CSCM). For infrastructure projects, building information modeling and geographic information systems are strongly encouraged for improved productivity and better coordination. The convergence of BIM and GIS creates a complete digital representation of the physical environment. BIM may be used to produce, manage, and exchange operational data of building structures, whereas GIS could be used to handle the logistic aspect of the construction project and store, organize, and analyze data representing the horizontally spread urban environment. As a result, the unified utilization of BIM and GIS is crucial in Urban Sustainability applications that require data from both facilities and the urban environment. Because BIM has only been around for around ten years, and combined BIM and GIS applications have only been around for an even shorter time, there is no solid framework on the latter for individuals who are just getting started with BIM and GIS in Civil Engineering.

Originating from a standard dedicated to design (BS 1192:2007) and although its concept has been extended to information management in general: Capex (strategy, project, construction: PAS 1192-2) and Opex (exercise: PAS 1192-3), the CDE, as it is understood today in common practice, is still very much affected by the original link with the design and the design phase (and in particular the design in the new building). All this according to an information flow that is still very linear and sequential: client, designer, builder, manager, user; more than circular, as the so-called BIM methodology would like. The risk, therefore, is that the commercial software market is affected by this CDE approach, which is also useful for the very rich real estate market of the emerging economies, neglecting the construction market of the more consolidated economies (Europe for before), very built up, and aimed more at housing quality, sustainability, reuse, and renewal of the existing heritage rather than the new one. It is consequently necessary to define new information flows and a new type of information management environment (CDE) for the phases of use, conservation, and renovation of buildings for the European market. The need arises for a specific BIM Management System (BIMMS, overcoming the classic CDE) for asset management and their enhancement that collects information from the buildings themselves and its users (Digital Twins, IoT, sensors, etc.). A new CDE / BIMMS that uses semantics and open dialogue, via API, with multiple Tools rather than acting as a repository of files and models.

With the big data of social development, the development of my country\u2019s construction industry has gradually transitioned from a development model that simply pursues scale and speed to a new stage that focuses on urban development and people\u2019s needs. The traditional way of expressing buildings in two-dimensional planes can no longer meet people\u2019s needs for integrated interior design of buildings. In this regard, the purpose of this article is to conduct innovative research on architectural interior design models in the context of big data. This article first starts from reality, combs the representative domestic and international architectural interior design planning theories, and explores architectural interior design models suitable for domestic project construction. This paper proposes an integrated model of building interior design based on big data technology. This paper aims at the expression of the three-dimensional model of the building interior, combined with BIM technology, designing the architectural spatial information model from the perspective of concept and logic. For the designed building space information model, this paper starts from the traditional plane CAD data, and conducts big data research on the simplified algorithm of CAD data. Secondly, it builds the model of the special building components of the research object, and then realizes the interior design model Construct. Experimental results show that the architectural interior design model proposed in this paper can effectively manage and analyze interior design, and people\u2019s satisfaction with design has increased by about 25%, meeting people\u2019s needs, and providing an important reference for architectural interior design.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4205395926"}}

This technology has been well received by the Malaysian construction industry but has not been implemented in construction project management. The key goals of this study were to identify problems and challenges experienced in the implementation of BIM in the affordable housing construction industry and to identify possible solution for the affordable housing construction industry in Johor Bahru to introduce BIM. Using survey questionnaire, the approach adopted for this study was quantitative method. Around 180 of the building player respondents were interested in this analysis. Sampling was used where respondents were recommended by experts and experienced company/company contractors. The results concluded that problems and difficulties, and high information technology costs were the top rated and the respondents preferred reduced construction time and expenses as the best options for the possible solutions. From this study, it can be concluded that the respondents of the construction industry are primarily concerned with perception of time, cost and quality related with building projects.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4312640926"}}

For this, from the design phase, the first stage of the construction process, the creating of information of the building design is being built with 3D-based digital data. Architectural design BIM application can be used to improve drawing consistency, quantity calculation, and visualization of complex building parts, and these could be effective. Also, it seems to be an important to build a BIM model so that safe environments such as crime prevention analysis and daylight analysis can be reviewed in advance in apartment housing design. However, compared to the increasing BIM project list, the direct BIM-based design performance has not increased yet. This study is to analyze the factors that prevent direct BIM-based design from proceeding, and the architectural design environmental aspects and the BIM project process for D company s apartment house design were analyzed. Through this, the relationship between additional work scopes and fees in the design phase was confirmed. And although the BIM design project was ordered, the schedule and process focused on the 2D-based method could be confirmed. In addition, the lack of understanding of BIM design characteristics of project participants, that is, designers and clients, was also having an impact. In order to improve this issue, it was inferred that institutional supplementation for each type of work, especially the process and architectural design information creation results that can be directly utilized by architectural designers, is necessary.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4225988026"}}

The built buildings perform poorly in terms of energy usage and energy conservation. The study expects to explore the potential safety hazards of prefabricated buildings during the construction process. On this basis, a modelling study of the construction process is carried out. The study uses Digital Twins (DTs) technology and prefabricated Building Information Modelling (BIM) to conduct in-depth modelling research on the building construction process. The prefabricated building construction system oriented to DTs technology can well solve the problems of structural damage and deformation in the production, transportation, and assembly process of building components. Especially in prefabricated buildings, it can monitor and accurately predict the damage of building components that may occur in the entire system due to structural problems and material problems in real time. Regarding the building information model, the study uses third-party software to transfer the assembly information to the network cloud to further realize the display of the BIM. The study shows that the maximum value of the effective risk cases selected is 130, and its effective rate is 100%; after processing the data, it is found that the initial value is always stable, and its value is 1; the extracted value is always changing, the maximum value is 0.86, and the minimum is 0.75.

Abstract. Land subdivision represents a complex procedure which leads to the construction of a set of buildings and utilities necessary for the viability of the project: Roads, sewerage network, water network, electricity network and telecommunication networks. The techniques adopted so far to carry out land subdivision projects in Morocco have certain limitations. Several stakeholders are necessary for the realization of a land subdivision and many 2D plans and documents are used. These plans and documents are independently produced and carried out by the various trades involved in the project. If a change is made to one element of the project, which often happens, several documents and plans are affected and must be updated. This can be a source of errors and conflicts and can lead to an increase in the time and cost of the hall project. This study proposes the development of a Building Information Modelling (BIM) infrastructure workflow adapted to land subdivision projects in Morocco. The integration of BIM in this type of project is an innovation in the Moroccan context. It will improve the design, simplify communication and collaboration between the various stakeholders and facilitate the management and the monitoring of the project. The resulting digital BIM model can be used to produce 2D and 3D construction plans, take measurements and plan work. It constitutes the basic platform to perform calculations and simulations at any stage of the infrastructure life cycle and to detect and resolve interferences in a collaborative environment.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4200286301"}}

Building Information Modeling (BIM), in the last couple of decades, has emerged as a technology that can be used in combination with different methodologies in the fields of architecture, engineering, and construction industry as a digital model to facilitate the planning and design process, construction and maintenance. Using the tools of BIM, the stakeholders generate the digital models that can help them to identify the problems. A total of 24 conference papers, referenced journal articles, and other academic sources were analyzed based on their relevance and research focus areas. This article provides a review on the integration of building information modeling with different methodologies for seismic retrofitting of both structural and non-structural components of buildings. Pre-seismic and post-seismic applications of Building Information Modeling with the integration of different methodologies have been reviewed overbuilding life cycles with a view of addressing the challenges and recommending the future research perspectives. In the end, by stating the possibilities of integration of BIM tools with different methodologies mainly using Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering as a paradigm which is fully probabilistic, this paper concludes that the implication of the Building Information Modeling with the integration of different methodologies isnt merely the inclusion of the certain conditions, but also of the numerical integration of all the possible uncertainties.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3184169010"}}

Building information modelling promises model-based collaboration between stakeholders in the project design stage. However, data exchange between physical and analytical building models used for architectural design and structural analysis respectively rarely takes place due to numerous differences in building element representation, especially the representation of geometry. This paper presents the realization of a novel data exchange framework between architectural design and structural analysis building models, based on open interpretations on central storage. The exchange is achieved with a new system architecture, where the program redDim was developed to perform the interpretations, including the most challenging transformations of geometry. We deliver a proof of concept for the novel framework with a prototype building model and verify it on two further building models. Results show that structural-analysis models can be correctly automatically created by reducing dimensionality and reconnecting building elements. The proposed data exchange provides a base for missing standardization of interpretations, which facilitates the non-proprietary automated conversion between physical and analytical models.

Autodesk Revit software is software found in the Building Information Modeling (BIM) method which is used to design a construction project. The BIM method is a new approach in construction design. This is because this method not only facilitates digital presentation for the design but also provides all the information needed for each construction project. The use of Building Information Modeling method was introduced for the first time in Malaysia in 2007 by the Director of the Public Works Department (JKR). The introduction of this method was extended when the government realized that the use of BIM has many benefits to the country. This is because the use of BIM can overcome the problem of project construction at an early stage. The use of BIM can usually be distinguished by material consumption, construction period and marketing cost. The BIM method uses several types of software such as Revit Architecture and Inventor from Autodesk. The use of Autodesk Revit software which is one of the applications in the BIM method can help facility management to plan, collect information and manage a facility more effectively. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the implementation of Autodesk Revit software in the construction industry in Malaysia.

Presently, it is assessed by conventional site observation, labour-intensive data collection, and manual data analysis before designing a building mass, plan, fa\u00e7ade, openings, and interior space. City Information Model (CIM), with its capabilities to store, visualize, and analyze a wealth of site-related information, has a great potential to support an automated view assessment. However, its realization is nascent, and it has not integrated with architectural space planning in either research or practice. This research, therefore, aims to develop a model through which CIM can be extended to assist view assessment in architectural space planning. By literature review, brainstorming, prototyping, and case study, this research corroborates that by harnessing the power of CIM, the conventional view evaluation can be transformed from qualitative to mix-used. It helps practitioners assess a view and design a space in a more precise and rapid manner. This research also provides the integrated model for view evaluation in architectural space planning with three stages to support the real-world practice.

There has been a growing interest in integrating vegetation into the built environment in order to ameliorate the negative effects of increasing urbanisation. In Singapore, government policies encourage the inclusion of skyrise greenery into new and existing buildings. To further streamline workflows, statutory BIM (Building Information Modelling) submissions in architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries have been mandated. However, landscape plans are still excluded from these BIM submissions due to the lack of a centralised vegetation database and the absence of a standardised BIM format for landscape architectural submissions. This paper presents a streamlined methodology for creating and using a centralised vegetation library for landscape architects. The workflow leverages off the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard for data exchange regardless of the BIM authoring software used and provides a framework of four operational modules: an expandable and low-maintenance species-level vegetation library, a BIM authoring workflow that allows inclusion of vegetation objects, an IFC interface, and a lightweight 3D vegetation model generator. This paper also showcases a use-case of embedding information-enriched 3D vegetation objects into a simulated landscape plan. The proposed workflow, when adopted in AEC industries, will enable governing agencies to track diverse greening efforts by the industry and to potentially include other measurements such as cooling performance or maintainability.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3203804106"}}

Background: A site layout plan is one of the important decisions to be made in the planning phase of each construction project as it can significantly impact on-site transportation, construction logistics, and safety. This decision could be complicated owing to the uncertainties inherent in construction projects and the complex relationships between the influencing factors and decision variables. Methods: To improve site layout planning, this study aims to develop a simulation-based decision support tool (DST) that enables planners to consider the following: (1) construction uncertainties, (2) construction resources (i.e., material, equipment, and workers), (3) site layout constraints, and (4) mutual impacts between site layout and construction plan variables, for site layout planning of construction projects. Results: The developed DST visualizes the site layout plan within a simulation environment and provides seamless interactions between the site layout model and the simulation model. These capabilities facilitate planning construction site layout using simulation by establishing two-way information flows between the site layout and simulation components, which can further promote application of simulation in construction site layout planning.

Abstract The construction industry has often been described as stagnant and out-of-date due to the lack of innovation and innovative work methods to improve the industry (WEF, 2016; Ostravik, 2015). The adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) within the construction industry has been relatively slow (Cao et al., 2017), particularly in the South African Construction and Built Environment (CBE) (Allen, Smallwood &amp; Emuze, 2012). The purpose of this study was to determine the critical factors influencing the adoption of BIM in the South African CBE, specifically from a quantity surveyor\u2019s perspective, including the practical implications. The study used a qualitative research approach grounded in a theoretical framework. A survey questionnaire was applied to correlate the interpretation of the theory with the data collected (Naoum, 2007). The study was limited to professionals within the South African CBE. The study highlighted that the slow adoption of BIM within the South African CBE was mainly due to a lack of incentives and subsequent lack of investment towards the BIM adoption. The study concluded that the South African CBE operated mainly in silos without centralised coordination. The BIM adoption was only organic. Project teams were mostly project orientated, seeking immediate solutions, and adopted the most appropriate technologies for the team\u2019s composition. The study implies that the South African CBE, particularly the Quantity Surveying profession, still depends heavily on other role-players in producing information-rich 3D models.

However, when property information is stored by room and registered by different businesses, the corresponding building information may be inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Therefore, entity resolution using a rule-based method is insufficient and requires extensive manual post-processing. This study proposes an entity resolution method for apartment properties using neural networks with inputs containing traditional property attributes and new attributes obtained from the phonetic and semantic pre-processing of building names. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves entity resolution accuracy.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3205397582"}}

The integration of BIM with other analytical algorithms also allows optimization of designs, such as the generative design that can parametrize the design. This study proposes a generative design approach that utilizes the optimization of the drywall installation layout to improve overall project efficiency. The framework includes a decision support module that considers environmental, cost, and aesthetic aspects to identify the optimal layout. The framework\u2019s practical applicability has been successfully demonstrated through a case study. After implementation, three \u201cbest\u201d design alternatives were found according to the decision aspects. The design improvements achieved were 37.5%, 7%, and 54% for the environmental, cost, and aesthetic factors, respectively. Accordingly, practitioners can make better decisions on planning drywall projects. This approach has proven effective in planning drywall installation and can be applied in similar design scenarios for other prefabricated construction processes.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3180630644"}}

Architectural constraints do not require the subject to be aware of them and automatically enforce by preempting behavior. This feature leads to efficient governance, but previous research pointed out concerns caused by the \u201cUnnecessity of Awareness\u201d of architecture. This concern should be avoided by visualizing architectural constraints. However, a concrete visualization method has not been proposed. We propose a method to visualize the relationship between regulations and architectural constraints in accordance with ISO/IEC/IEEE42010:2011. System engineers use this method to reveal the constraints faced by users owing to the architecture and verify that there is no deviation from the regulations.

This article examines the difference between digital counterparts and BIM technologies in terms of their role in design and construction, and their interaction with the environment. The features of the technologies are analyzed, as well as the sources of the effectiveness of the use of digital doubles in housing and communal services are considered. Building information modeling (BIM) is a technology that is based on the collection and processing of data on the architectural and planning, structural, economic, technological, and operational characteristics of an object. All the data embedded in the model interact and are connected to each other. This technology is an important step in the development of the digital, construction and economic industries. Allows you to focus on each section of the project in the information field and contributes to the improvement of the object management system. A digital double is a digital model that allows you to optimize your business, reflect the entire structure of the model, the technical condition, and also, through the use of analysis of physical and mathematical models, get a general idea of the construction object. In fact, a digital double is defined as an integrated virtual model of an object, obtained in the course of mathematical, physical, and intellectual analysis, which reflects the physical and technical condition of the object, its performance, and this together allows you to optimize the efficiency of financial investments. The creation of digital doubles is an integral part of the digital transformation of the Russian industry. This is quite a complex task, which involves solving serious financial costs, with painstaking selection and analysis of the results, comparing them with the costs. The economic effects of implementing implementation projects are manifested in the effective distribution and use of financial, material, technical and human resources and are achieved in several areas at once.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4377836186"}}

This paper takes a complex project as an example to carry out the whole process of BIM application in prefabricated building design and construction, which makes the building realize the integrated innovative design of structural system, electromechanical system and prefabricated construction. The maximal adaptability to the space of the complex building is created, resulting in a high quality construction that adds significant value.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3170433324"}}

Abstract In recent years, prefabricated construction has been widely concerned with its significant advantages of high efficiency, environmental protection and energy saving. However, the prefabricated construction in China is in the initial stage, with more theoretical research than practical cases. Even with strong policy support, the development of prefabricated buildings is relatively slow. There are many reasons for this. The main reason is that the cost of prefabricated construction is too high for most developers to bear. This paper attempts to study the effect of BIM Technology on the whole process of cost management, aiming to solve the problem of cost compression in the implementation stage of prefabricated construction project and overcome the bottleneck of prefabricated construction development.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3162954545"}}

Offsite construction (OSC) is attracting increasing attention from both industry and academia due to its benefits, such as improved productivity and quality, as well as reduced waste. However, the current building panelization design in OSC is a time-consuming and experience-based manual process, and the generated panelization design may result in unbalanced manufacturing processes. One reason is that the prefabrication of building components involves a highly variable product mix and there is a lack of a computational framework to evaluate panelization design. The objective of this research is, thus, to propose a BIM-based generative framework that automatically generates the design of production components with the aim of improving production productivity. This framework consists of a building information extraction module, a generative design algorithm, and a simulation-based performance evaluation model. The building information extraction module is designed to extract building component information from a BIM model and classify building components into different production groups in accordance with functionalities and materials. The generative design algorithm is then developed to formulate panelization design alternatives in consideration of the structural, production, and logistics constraints. On this basis, the generated panelization designs are quantitatively assessed by a simulation-based evaluation model in terms of productivity. A case study was used to verify and validate the framework. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by a computational framework of building panelization design, which leverages the generative design algorithm and BIM-simulation integration for optimized panelization design.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3158653109"}}

In the pipeline engineering of construction equipment pipeline construction, whether from the construction efficiency, construction quality or performance, 3D simulation technology has immeasurable role and far-reaching practical significance, and also has the intuitive nature of construction projects. In the construction equipment pipeline engineering, the problem of insufficient space gap and pipeline crossing is the most common problem in the construction equipment pipeline design industry and the actual workers in the construction. Using three-dimensional simulation technology, we can establish a relatively complete three-dimensional model of building pipeline information, and timely find the unreasonable actual situation and disadvantages in the process of building implementation. This cost can be cancelled before the actual construction, saving money, improving efficiency and shortening the construction period. With the continuous development of construction, the requirements of construction enterprises for construction efficiency have been improved, and the requirements of construction units for project quality and appearance have also been improved. In such a big environment, we put forward more requirements for the construction of building pipeline system. In order to better develop and adapt to the requirements of the times, the construction units of building pipeline should increase the application and promotion of new technologies, and use all kinds of new technologies to improve their production efficiency and quality.

Abstract The main objective of the process of the interior architecture education is to prepare an efficient and skillful designer with the ability to practice the profession and compete at the local and international job markets. A look at the actual practice of interior architecture education in Egypt and the Arab world shows that it is based solely on the use of (CAD) technology, which creates only two or three-dimensional lines and shapes. Building Information Modeling (BIM), however, is a smart technology that deals with parameteric information elements, not just solid lines and forms. The present study identifies the possibilities, significance and methodology of using (BIM) technology to enhance the education of interior architecture. Integrating (BIM) technology into the educational process will improve it and improve students' knowledge and designing and creative skills, which will in turn promote the profession in general. This field study followed the descriptive, analytical and applied method to show some of (BIM)'s various options and capabilities beneficial to both students and designers. The study confirmed the importance of using (BIM) technology in interior architecture education and highlighted some conclusions, suggestions, solutions and recommendations that emphasize the role of building information modeling in enhancing interior architecture education.

A quantitative research methodology was adopted involving the use of questionnaire survey to collect primary data. The data were obtained from private real estate developers in Lagos State. The self-administered questionnaire was distributed to all the 72 active real estate developers in the study area, and the response rate was 62.5%. The collected data were analysed using statistical tools such as frequency and percentages, mean rating and chi-square. The results revealed a low level of awareness and usage of the transformative and contemporary BIM technology (6D BIM version) by real estate developers. It was established that the 2D and 3D BIM traditional versions were the most utilised across the phases of real estate development process. It was also found that the level of BIM utilisation has a significant relationship with the age and asset base of the real estate developers. The chapter concludes by advocating increase in the asset base and organisational profile of real estate developers to enhance BIM adoption, especially, the 6D BIM, which could facilitate sustainable real estate development.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3137463921"}}

This study focuses on the custom home building segment of residential construction in the United States because of the unique and complex nature of each project. These project characteristics may assist in the realization of some purported benefits of BIM implementation, like those experienced in commercial applications. Utilizing the Delphi method, industry experts identified and achieved consensus on the most common uses, benefits, and challenges they faced in their implementation of BIM. The primary uses of BIM in residential construction identified by this expert panel were design and visualization, the creation of construction documents, and quantity takeoffs. The leading benefits identified were client visualization, plan accuracy, improved client communication, and ease of plan revisions. The leading challenges identified by the panel were high software costs, the steep learning curve when training employees, and the time-consuming nature of creating and maintaining models correctly.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2781789850"}}

In recent years, the requirement for landscaping has become increasingly stringent as large-scale bridge construction continues in China, and a conventional bridge scheme creation process has the disadvantage of having too many factors to consider and being difficult to coordinate and inefficient to collaborate. Faced by the current situation of short scheme creating period, bridge engineers should strengthen their role as designers and be able to perform scheme creation and design independently and efficiently. Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology can provide bridge engineers with advanced technical means and design process. This paper mainly studies how to apply BIM technology to improve the efficiency, cost control and quality of bridge scheme creation, using the Minjiang Bridge in Meishan City, Sichuan Province as an example. From the discussion it can be seen that: (1) the efficiency of scheme creation, presentation and scheme selection can be improved with the aid of the new process and approach together with the Parameterized Scheme Library; (2) the all-in-one process of scheme creation and design led by the bridge designer effectively simplifies communication and iteration; (3) compared with the conventional approach, the new method greatly improves the efficiency and quality of scheme creation.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3138171224"}}

The construction industry is undergoing a digital revolution due to the emergence of new technologies. A significant trend is that construction projects have been transformed and upgraded to the digital and smart mode in the whole life cycle. As a critical technology for the construction industry\u2019s innovative development, building information modeling (BIM) is widely adopted in building design, construction, and operation. BIM has gained much interest in the research field of smart buildings in recent years. However, the dimensions of BIM and smart building applications have not been explored thoroughly so far. With an in-depth review of related journal articles published from 1996 to July 2020 on the BIM applications for smart buildings, this paper provides a comprehensive understanding and critical thinking about the nexus of BIM and smart buildings. This paper proposes a framework with three dimensions for the nexus of BIM application in smart buildings, including BIM attributes, project phases, and smart attributes. According to the three dimensions, this paper elaborates on (1) the advantages of BIM for achieving various smartness; (2) applications of BIM in multiple phases of smart buildings; and (3) smart building functions that be achieved with BIM. Based on the analysis of the literature in three dimensions, this paper presents the cross-analysis of the nexus of BIM and smart buildings. Lastly, this paper proposes the critical insights and implications about the research gaps and research trends: (1) enhancing the interoperability of BIM software; (2) further exploring the role of BIM in the operation and refurbishment phase of smart buildings; (3) paying attention to BIM technology in the field of transportation infrastructure; (4) clarifying the economic benefits of BIM projects; and (5) integrating BIM and other technologies.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3135652008"}}

In takt production, production must be monitored frequently to make sure that the production follows the takt schedule. However, takt production monitoring methods have not been discussed in literature. In this study, a digital monitoring solution for takt production is developed and tested in a case apartment renovation project in Finland. At first, the production monitoring in the case project was done in paper format. This monitoring form was then developed into a digital monitoring application. The progression of production tasks was entered into the application manually. These entries were then automatically compared with a digital takt schedule. As a result, production status can be analyzed automatically and provide diverse information for the construction foremen. This information can be automatically visualized and used as a detailed status report for site meetings.

Abstract Innovative technologies help automate the work of the designer. A 3D model of the building can be used to calculate the required values. This will also allow you to create associative sections that, when changing the geometry of the 3D model, automatically adjust the drawn elements on the resulting 2D drawing. Information technologies enable participants from all over the world to work on one project and, thanks to the BIM (building information modelling) method, to design buildings during their life cycle more efficiently. At present, critical studies are published on interoper-ability in BIM and its lack of coordination or amount of information that is misinterpreted, etc. However, working in BIM is the most effective way to use computer technology to design buildings. There is a lot of information about the building in the 3D model itself, which can also be used for purposes other than construction (building management, reconstruction). But how to process a large amount of information in a 3D model? Many buildings already have their 3D models shared on cloud platforms, these contain information that could help, for example, find solutions for green construction using artificial intelligence (AI).

Taking a indemnificatory housing project as an example, this paper studies the application of BIM Technology in the deepening design and construction of steel structure. Aiming at the creation of complete BIM, this paper proposes an integrated BIM construction framework for the whole life cycle of buildings. By studying the basic structure, modeling process, application architecture and key modeling technologies of integrated BIM, a prototype system of BIM data integration and service platform is developed. The feasibility and applicability of bimisp are verified through the practical application of affordable housing project. In the application of BIM Technology, multiple BIM software and data fusion technology are used to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The test results show that: using BIM platform to give full play to the advantages of the software, improve the efficiency of in-depth design and on-site installation of steel structure project, which can provide reference for the application of BIM Technology in prefabricated buildings in the future.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3167083624"}}

In the construction field, the Building Information Modeling (BIM) methodology is becoming increasingly predominant and the standardization of its use is now an essential operation. This method has become widespread in recent years, thanks to the advantages provided in the framework of project management and interoperability. Hoping for its complete dissemination, it is unthinkable to use it only for new construction interventions. Many are experiencing what happens with the so-called Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM); that is, how BIM interfaces with Architectural Heritage or simply with historical buildings. This article aims to deal with the principles and working methodologies behind BIM/HBIM and modeling. The aim is to outline the themes on which to base a new approach to the instrument. In this way, it can be adapted to the needs and characteristics of each type of building. Going into the detail of standards, the text also contains a first study regarding the classification of moldable elements.

Natural environment, construction, transportation and other factors have a great impact on the construction process of modern residential buildings. The interaction of these factors is the reason for the uncertainty of concrete dam pouring environment, but the traditional method is not suitable for this uncertainty. Therefore, discrete event simulation (DES) is widely used in construction simulation, rather than actual construction. This is because most simulation models are created by professionals and require manpower and material resources. Even if there is a small change in the simulation process, it should be introduced into the simulation model to adjust in order to adapt to the new environment. With the help of DES technology based on BIM to construct the framework of concrete dam, this paper fully studies the relationship between concrete structure and BIM and the two-dimensional code technology, solves the problem of information expression, and plays an important role in the application of simulation technology in the research of construction progress and reasonable design of construction scheme.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3130412676"}}

Abstract Each construction work has its volume to be built. The use of traditional 2D methods in the breakdown and management of high-rise building construction volume has recently faced quite a few challenges; for instance, some projects construction has been prolonged or project-cost estimates are unsound due to duplicated or omitted calculation. This happens because the quantity surveyor (QS) manages the construction volume manually and relies on 2D design drawings for calculations. For this to be solved, the adoption of BIM technology in construction volume management should be an irresistible choice. BIM technology empowers the breakdown and management of work volume by automating the calculation of volumes and updating structure parameters as well as integrating design, progress and cost data into a single 3D model.

Existing studies have discussed these barriers extensively, but the research on the barriers to the implementation of BIM amid building industrialization in China is inadequate. In this study, 23 barriers were identified through literature review. A questionnaire survey approach was used to collect data from various parties. Factor analysis methods were used to process and rank barrier factors for BIM applications in the context of industrialized building. Based on the analysis of each factor, analytic hierarchy process was adopted to identify the key barriers to the implementation of BIM for industrialized building construction. The study concluded that the main barriers for BIM implementation for industrialized building were capital-related factors and the lack of support from owners.

Currently, the digitalization of construction projects is becoming a reality. The energy model of a build-ing (BEM) is being introduced into the design practice, which does not allow directly solving the prob-lems of designing engineering systems of a building. There is a gap in approaches to building a digital building information model. On the one hand, there is the maximum use of information from the digital model during design calculations. On the other hand, there is a simplification of mathematical models for solving problems related to the design of engineering systems. Many important tasks of design and op-eration of engineering systems are not solved in conjunction with the premises of the building. It is pro-posed to use the representation of the building as a graph, which will allow you to solve the problems of design and operation of engineering systems correctly. Most of the necessary information is already pre-sent in the building information model and can be extracted from it automatically. As an example of con-verting information from a digital model, the problem of determining the heat loss of premises was cho-sen. This task is a mandatory part of any project. Existing software products do not allow you to automat-ically determine the dimensions of the enclosing structures of the room that are necessary for solving the problem, and do not take into account the relative location of the premises. These reasons determine the need to develop the application.&#x0D; Materials and methods: To solve the problems of design and operation of engineering systems of a building, it is proposed to use a topological model of a building, which is a connected graph, the compo-nents of which are a base subgraph describing the connections between the premises of the building and subgraphs of engineering systems. The data structure and algorithm for forming a basic building sub-graph based on a digital building model are presented&#x0D; Results: The software application that implements the proposed algorithm was tested on the calculation of heat loss in the premises of a building. A 3D model of a 10-storey residential building was used as the object of the experiment. As a result of the experiment, a reduction in the time required for the prepara-tion of the initial information and for the calculation was revealed from 8 hours to 20 minutes..&#x0D; Conclusions: Taking into account the relative location of building premises and life support systems in the topological model of the building allows solving problems of environmental and fire safety, optimiz-ing design solutions for supply, exhaust, smoke ventilation systems and other tasks. The developed soft-ware module designed for calculating the heat loss of premises is the first step in the development of software products that use a digital model of a building as the initial information for building a topologi-cal model.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3144305290"}}

In this study, attempts are made to review the state-of-the-art BIM applications on design and prefabrication automation of industrialized buildings, with more emphasis on the recent achievement in concrete 3D printing technology. Following this, a BIM method is proposed to support the detailed geometry design and digital fabrication of modular housings. A program interfaced within BIM is developed and demonstrated through discussions on its capacity in generating the geometry details of 3D-printed modules. In addition, robotic simulation of 3D printing is performed to explore a flexible plan in producing the 3D-printed modules or components. The lessons learned from the study are discussed to highlight the future research challenges and opportunities. First, as current Industry Foundation Classes-based BIM model provides limited support to prefabrication, research on BIM open standards demands more attentions to interoperate the computerized design and computer-aided manufacturing. Moreover, today\u2019s industrialized buildings consist of sophisticated architectural, structural, and mechanical systems that are intervened across the whole life cycle, more research on the interdependent building systems is needed (via digital twins) to optimize the life cycle performance. When moving towards data-driven decision making, there are research needs to expand Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence to collect the big data from prefabrication, perform predictive analysis, and optimize the control decisions for manufacturing facilities operations.

However, due to lack of BIM application in landscape filed, limited researches could be found on how many excessive works could be prevented by BIM and its ecological value in protecting local environment, especially for those hillside areas with relatively vulnerable ecosystem, which covers over two thirds of the land in China. This paper aims to set up a BIM-based landscape design workflow and examine its effectiveness in reducing construction waste produced in design process. One project case of hillside residential district planning design was carried out by applying the established BIM workflow, showing that earthworks were reduced significantly, and the final net cut/fill volume was controlled at 32.45m3 after project completion.

Design plays a leading role in architectural design, which determines the quality of construction projects. At present, most of the prefabricated constructures are designed according to the principle of cast-in-place construction, and the structural system basically follows the mode of cast-in-place structure. The advantages of prefabricated industrialization have not been reflected in the system of prefabricated construction structure and design. Due to various factors, it has become highly difficult to design prefabricated buildings, making it impossible to complete the design with the help of traditional design tools. Instead, it needs to rely on BIM Technology to complete the prefabricated construction design so as to make the construction projects visible, controllable and informationalized. Moreover, the design information from various parties concerned can be highly integrated and coordinated, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of construction projects and enhancing buildings' quality [1] .", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3176047042"}}

In the initial phase, the case-study building in Basmane with the surrounding environment was digitally modeled for the following analyses. Several programs apart from BIM have been utilized for the daylight zones and wind simulations. The daylight areas affecting the surface of the studied building were marked schematically per the simulation data. Subsequently, the area of the curtain wall, material type, preliminary building unit cost (assembly/labor and material cost), the height of storey, the density of elements, and fixed shading devices parameters were tested via optimization thru generative design methodology and provide potential design solutions by utilization of BIM tools.Findings The findings of this study could be boiled down to a single comprehensive objective of generating outputs of assorted design solutions thru a generative design approach. When the output data set is visualized via parallel coordinate graphs, it could be well articulated that the classification of rule-based relationships and the criteria interrelations were based on the designer's decisions.Research Limitations/Implications This study was examined on a case basis by an experimental approach. It shall be considered that the curtain wall construction encompasses diverse materials, connection details, and construction techniques that affect the final cost thus this research was conducted at the preliminary design stage and might not reflect actual costs.Social/Practical Implications Albeit the technical aspect of the curtain walls is not included in this case study, it helps generative design culture by demonstrating the extent of the opportunities it offers to designers in the preliminary design stage.Originality/Value This study is a show-case of a preliminary design for an actual building stock in the vicinity of Basmane focusing on the building envelope design process with multiple parameters and should be regarded as an opportunity to understand how innovative solutions alike are put forward for the use of designers.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3116064112"}}

Abstract Many floor plans are proposed during the early stage of an apartment housing remodeling project as it involves a multitude of entities with different stakes. Consequently, the process to converge the opinions per the individual's preference on an agreed remodeling floor plan becomes repetitive and time consuming. For these reasons, structural evaluation of each proposed conceptual plan is often bypassed and postponed until a finalized floor plan is determined. An automated structural evaluation application for architectural floor plans of apartment housing with the load-bearing wall system is developed on this necessity. The application reads the conceptual drawings and returns various supportive information regarding structural performance, almost instantly. The outputs from the application include the amount of removed, remaining, and new bearing walls, 3D views of each wall component overlaid on the floor plans and their dimensions, area moment of inertia (AMOI) of the walls, torsional resistance of the floor plans, and other supportive indices. For easy and intuitive communication with the users, an abstract and simple quantitative value, structural index (SI), is suggested and included as one of the outputs in the application. In order to validate the developed automated application, a case study is conducted with an ongoing remodeling project, and the results, accuracy, and processing time are compared with the conventional hand calculation method. The application is accurate with errors of less than 1.3%, while the processing speed is nearly seven times faster. With the developed application, the designers could evaluate their conceptual drawings in almost real time. In addition, the stakeholders would communicate in a more straightforward language with the outputs of the application, such as the AMOI evaluation and SI results. Consequently, it is anticipated that the decision-making process during the early stage of a remodeling project would be expedited with the help of the developed automated application.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3115489575"}}

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is becoming an integral part of the design, architecture, and construction process, as it can integrate all building data in an accessible digital representation that can be viewed in a 3D environment prior to construction. This supports the capability of evaluating a model against building codes or design rules to ensure that the building meets the relevant functional and safety requirements for occupants. However, building regulations are typically represented in natural language and, to date, they have not been created with regard to the digital BIM design process. To automate the design evaluation of a building model, this paper describes a simple, yet extendable, domain-specific language for computationally representing building interior design rules and a method for evaluating rules in this language against a BIM model. Furthermore, previous language-based model-checking approaches have not explored the applicability of their proposed languages beyond model-design evaluation. This paper demonstrates the use of our language in a second, more complex, use case, namely the automated generation of multiple valid alternative model interior designs, compliant to a set of design rules expressed in our language. We have evaluated the usefulness of our language in two generative-design case studies, namely kitchen layouts using a set of real-world kitchen design rules provided by an commercial partner, and living-room layouts using rules put forward in earlier automated-design research. Therefore, this research bridges the concepts of automated model checking and generative design relying on the same rule language.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3082354722"}}

The current paper concentrates not only on the construction of 3D buildings with extrusions but also compares the various levels of details in two different BIM based 3D softwares namely ESRI City Engine and Revit Architecture. A 3D building object can be represented basically with four LOD levels at each stage of the building construction. The focal point of the current study also reflects the creation of building interiors and their corresponding attribute information to each element of the building. In City Engine software developed by ESRI, CGA codes are modified and customized to enhance the advancement in the building construction such as generation of building mass, segments, Roofs, Facade Creation, and other Architectural elements. These basic blocks of the building are produced by using Rule based pseudo codes in City Engine. The study illustrates a sample building and incorporates these codes to generate the 3D Building and the interiors are designed with more detailed components in Revit software.

The article shows that in all the significant successes of using BIM in large infrastructure projects, the influence of the state, both legislative and scientific forces, is great. The participation of the state is explained by the fact that BIM is a technology of a new technological order based on the digitalization of the economy, and the possibilities of competition and development of states are determined by their ability to keep up with the technological race. The first part of the article is devoted to the analysis of public-private partnerships in the development of BIM technology on the example of large infrastructure projects. The second part of the article is focused on the analysis of the achieved level of development of BIM technology. It is concluded that BIM is a new paradigm - a drawingless technology for creating and managing engineering data in the life cycle of a construction object.

The development of a detailed electronic three-dimensional plan is a valuable virtual base that allows you to create, display and use for engineering purposes models of various types of engineering, telecommunications and computer networks, plan their construction, modernization and replacement. Connecting external databases to the electronic model allows you get a full specification of buildings, networks and any other objects, display a time record of repairs, replacements, etc. in addition, the 3D model allows you to enter the color differentiation of objects, which can give additional information, for example, the allocation of dangerous equipment (fire, explosive, etc.) in red or other color on the three-dimensional plan of the building. AutoCAD was selected to build a 3D model of the branched multi-storey building of one of the buildings of a modern University, which allows you to get accurate 3D models, has the means of obtaining sections and sections, and also provides a fairly realistic visualization. To obtain a 3D model of the University buildings, all the work was divided into the following stages: building two-dimensional electronic plans of each floor; building three-dimensional models of each floor; combining floor models into a common 3D model of the building. Models of buildings were created on separate layers, which makes it easy to turn off a particular layer, and to study the internal structure of buildings. The 3D model has real dimensions and is easily scaled. Engineering networks and other equipment items can be attached to the model elements in the future, and other tasks will also be solved, such as the location of fire-fighting equipment, escape routes, emergency exits, etc. When creating 3D models, we used the color differentiation of objects.

The availability of current and accurate data has been recognized as a key to improving productivity in construction. Building information modeling (BIM) is expected to meet this need. Public-sector organizations procure construction projects, mostly using the traditional project delivery method (the lowest responsible and responsive bidder approach) that hinders the early collaboration of the designers and contractors, and hence the use of BIM. This lack of communication often results in adversely affecting the accuracy and completeness of scope, schedule, and cost of the project. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of using BIM on projects procured using design-bid-build (DBB) delivery method in Pakistan. The issue of BIM model development and its ownership were investigated. A survey and a case study were carried out to explore this topic. Of 60 respondents, 70 percent of respondents agreed that BIM could contribute to improved constructability, 70 percent thought that the primary designers should develop the model, and 63 percent of the total respondents felt that the BIM model should be updated by the contractor during project execution. Conversely, only 14 percent of the respondents thought that the contractor should create a three-dimensional (3D) model based on two dimensional (2D) traditional blueprints (in order to gain the benefits of BIM on-site). The experts who were interviewed mentioned that the cost of implementation and shortage of BIM trained professionals are significant barriers. Moreover, existing contract conditions do not accommodate BIM usage, and hence, the contractual obligations of each stakeholder need to be spelled out to facilitate the use of BIM. In the case study, a significant discrepancy of material quantities was found when a BIM model was retroactively created; for example, 20 percent more square footage for the ceiling systems, while 20 percent less in reinforcing steel quantity mostly due to missing information, errors in 2D plans, and errors in quantity calculations.

As popular as BIM has become with general contractors (GC) and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) trades in project delivery today, the drywall industry has seemed to lag behind the rest. Metal stud framing in drywall construction is a crucial constituent of project coordination in various project types such as healthcare, institutional, and general commercial projects. It could significantly affect MEP trades and overall project coordination efforts due to critical framing arrangement required at the interfacing between metal studs and MEP components. Poor design and construction coordination of metal stud framing often lead to an increase in costs, materials, and time. Currently in the Central Valley, very few drywall and metal framing contractors are involved in BIM-facilitated project coordination process, attributed to either a lack of technological sophistication of BIM, or uncertainty in perceived value of investing in BIM by the specialty contractors. This paper attempts to explore the cost benefit of implementing BIM from the perspective of a well-established local drywall and metal framing specialty contractor. A cost benefit analysis was conducted with historical project cost data to compare potential cost savings and business benefits should the specialty contractor had in-house talent for BIM-facilitated metal stud framing design and coordination. The analysis considered major cost factors including investment in BIM hardware, software and training, BIM employee\u2019s salary, as well as potential benefits from avoided coordination mistake costs, savings of reduced construction rework and change order, and potential new business opportunity due to capacity in BIM-facilitated metal stud framing design and coordination.

The use of technologies will not only improve productivity in the construction of future built environments but will also enhance their operation and maintenance as they become smart cities. These latter stages in the built asset project life cycle are impacted by Construction 4.0 technologies able to both automate and optimise their operations, thus bringing benefits for facility management while also linking the built environment fabric to wider societal and governmental systems. However, there is growing concern that Construction 4.0 is directing the industry towards a \u2018smart dystopia\u2019, a situation with as much vulnerability as resilience, without due consideration or challenge. For example, the automation of operational processes arguably increases vulnerabilities to cyberattacks, corruptions of data or energy loss, while the constant collection of worker and citizen data by smart buildings and infrastructures raises concerns around surveillance and privacy, as well as issues of exclusion. Although Construction 4.0 has the potential to enable the industry to support the delivery, operation and maintenance of an e-topia, such ethical and social challenges should perhaps be considered before its technologies are unquestioningly embedded within built assets for use throughout the duration of their life cycles.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3029632014"}}

Abstract One of the main reasons for introducing BIM into existing buildings is cost savings in the construction management and maintenance phase (operating phase). Operational phases have the biggest impact on the total life cycle costs. The introduction of BIM and the creation of a building information model, albeit at a higher price, will be counterbalanced several times by a more efficient way of managing the building during its life cycle, the possibility of creating a healthier indoor environment for building users and better access to necessary information, for example in the case of changes to completed buildings. The BIM model is a digital equivalent of a real construction \u2013 real digital twin. It contains geometric data in the form of a 3D model and non-geometry data, including construction management and support documents. The BIM model allows access to building usage information. The information obtained is more accurate. It keeps building element information up to date, enabling more informed decisions. It supports comparison of different solutions and their energy needs. Renovation can be done more efficiently. Construction information is up-to-date, so we can use the time needed to process different solutions instead of finding the necessary information about the construction.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3109880650"}}

A Conceptual Model for Transformation of Bill of Materials from Offsite Manufacturing to Onsite Construction in Industrialized House-building Raafat Hussamadin, Mikael Viklund Tallgren and Gustav Jansson Pages 1106-1113 (2020 Proceedings of the 37th ISARC, Kitakyushu, Japan, ISBN 978-952-94-3634-7) Abstract: Lending inspiration from the manufacturing industry, industrialized house-builders have adopted some of its characteristics such as high standardization of configurable products and manufacturing processes. Standardization of product and information flow within industrialized house-building has shown to beneficially increase offsite manufacturing efficiency. They have however not been able to transfer the increase in efficiency to onsite construction, leading to it being one of the key issues resulting in delays. For offsite manufacturing, previous research has suggested Bill of Material (BOM) as a structure to define information for in manufacturing phases. However, due to the variation in workflow between offsite manufacturing and onsite construction, the structure of a BOM for offsite manufacturing cannot be reused in onsite construction, ultimately resulting in increased data redundancy and recreation. A conceptual model of a BOM for onsite construction has been developed inspired by Bill of Materials (BOM), Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Location Breakdown Structure (LBS), Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and Work Instructions (WI). The conceptual model utilizes space structure LBS to link spaces with SOPs. Furthermore, it also utilizes WBS to link SOPs with WIs. The BOM for onsite construction is generated by a transformation from offsite manufacturing P-BOM. Streamlining the information flow and transformation between manufacturing and construction phases open the possibility to develop IT-solutions for industrialized house-builders. By developing existing IT-systems to reduce data redundancy, the fragmentation between offsite manufacturing and construction sites could be utilized by reusing existing data. The conceptual model supports multiple information views and allows for information filtering determined by the performed work and project.

A comprehensive construction company that receives orders for construction works is being constructed by subcontracting to a discontinued company when finishing work for civil engineering, beauty, and furniture. In addition, design details are often changed during the finishing construction phase due to reduced construction costs and design changes depending on the site situation before sub-contractor work. This leads to frequent meetings among finishing construction officials, wasting time and manpower to change drawings. As a way to prevent such problems in advance, architectural design is being carried out by applying BIM processes that virtually model facilities from planning, designing, engineering (structure, equipment, electricity, etc.) to construction, maintenance, and disposal of multi-dimensional virtual space, and the Public Procurement Service and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport are recommending mandatory for activating BIM. The BIM has many studies in the construction industry that have been combined with the fourth industrial technology to improve such problems as the delay of the schedule of subsequent processes due to construction errors, and the increase in construction costs. I would like to propose a system using existing BIM and fourth industrial technology as a way to utilize it in the closing construction stage. In this study, the theory and prior study of 3D Scanning, the fourth industrial technology, and the applicable support system at the finishing stage were reviewed in this study, and based on this, the process of XR cooperation system for finishing construction at the construction stage was established. Based on trends in current use of BIM and 3D Scanning, 3D Scanning technology can be used to convert 3D information collected at the site into BIM data and extract comparative data in conjunction with existing BIM data to detect errors related to site dimensions and construction location of the process prior to the finishing work, as well as to change the design of walls, columns, floors, furniture, etc. In addition, after converting all data into XR data, construction simulation can be checked in conjunction with XR equipment. The 3D Scanning data converted to BIM data is a system that can modify and check actual construction information such as design change and changed materials, quantity, and dimensions in advance through the system, and we want to grasp the construction status stage information and suggest a scenario for smooth communication among finishing construction workers.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3089090125"}}

Abstract Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a powerful tool that is widely utilized in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries in the United States for the design and construction of buildings, and is becoming prevalent worldwide. The BIM model can be used not only for architectural design, but also to analyze, design, and monitor multiple systems within a building. The structural engineer will keep a BIM model up-to-date with structural information as part of the design team requirements, but they must also model the building structure in separate programs for the purpose of structural analysis and design. This requirement for modeling the building twice is an inefficient use of resources, especially since a BIM model has the capabilities of aiding the structural design process through interfacing with those same programs. Utilizing a BIM model for the purpose of structural analysis and design is a topic that needs to be explored to understand its limits of application, and how it can be taught to students who will become part of the AEC industry upon graduation. With each new version of a BIM program, its interface with other programs related to the building systems analysis and design is enhanced and should be studied. Research on this topic will allow for discoveries on how and what to teach students, as well as what industry feels the new graduates should know pertaining to the subject. This paper will explore the use of BIM in the structural design process for Architectural Engineering programs.

The implications of BIM for AEC curriculums are discussed and strategies for integrating content related to BIM in AEC coursework are proposed. Introduction Parametric object-based design tools have become standard in architectural CAD applications and the ability to utilize parametric control of geometry and dimensional relationships has become an expectation 1. While the design flexibility and productivity afforded by parametric modeling positively impacts the role of computing in architectural design, the adoption of parametric computer modeling does not in itself dramatically alter the design process. However, this is not the case with the current generation of OOP-based architectural CAD applications which utilize Building Information Modeling (BIM). BIM applications integrate 3D-2D operations, which expands the conceptualization of computer modeling from an assembly of 3D geometry to that of a repository of project information and introduce a fully model-centric design process. The concept underlying BIM is using digital technologies to integrate all project data in order \u201cto build a building virtually prior to building it physically, in order to work out problems, and simulate and analyze potential impacts\u201d 2. Definitions of BIM vary, but common to most is an emphasis on the integration of project data. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) defined BIM as \u201ca model-based technology linked with a database of project information\u201d 3. More specifically, BIM has been defined as a combination of graphical project data such as 2D and 3D drawings and non-graphical information including specifications and cost data 4. Gallaher, O\u2019Connor, Detbar, and Gilday proposed a definition that is somewhat broader in that it considered the project in terms of post construction. They defined BIM as utilizing \u201ccutting edge digital technology to establish a computable representation of all the physical and functional characteristics of a facility and its related project/life-cycle information, and is intended to be a repository of information for the facility owner/operator to use and maintain throughout the life-cycle of a facility\u201d 4. The National Institute of Building Sciences published the following definition: \u201cBuilding information models, or BIMs (are) digital, easily managed and shared representations of physical and functional data that define buildings throughout their life cycles\u2014are increasingly seen throughout the public and private real estate and construction sectors as a way to control cost and performance problems associated with inaccurate and incomplete communications\u201d 5.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2735106246"}}

Among the digitalization processes which are being raised in Europe and in the world, the building permit process is seen as one of the priorities by municipalities, governmental institutions and standardization organizations. However, in current practice, the building permit issuing as well as the integration of geoinformation with BIM (GeoBIM) suffers from a number of complex sub-issues. These issues still remain and prevent the development of successful methodologies. In this paper, the building permit use case is explored within a project in close collaboration with the municipality of Rotterdam. A very specific case study in Rotterdam was selected as a starting point, which allowed us to develop the needed methodology for the implementation of an effective tool. In this paper we highlight the interpretation and formalization of regulation for building height, overhang and tower ratio. While these rules are specific to a zoning plan in Rotterdam, we believe that the methodology and encountered issues in formalizing the rules, applying the rules on delivered models and integrating various data sources (BIM and GIS specifically) are general to most building codes.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3083636892"}}

Abstract NOTE: The first page of text has been automatically extracted and included below in lieu of an abstract Building Information Modeling: A New Frontier for Construction Engineering Education Building Information Models (BIM\u2019s) are 3D parametric, virtual representations of the built environment. These models can contain the same amount of information as present in an actual building. They are also capable of representing specific details to facilitate extended analysis as needed ahead of construction. For example, all the performance parameters of specific materials such as concrete masonry units or fabricated structural steel are linked to particular installations within the BIM. This allows for the possibility of integrated engineering design such as finite element analysis. Consequently, as BIM technology progresses and improves, it has important implications for the practical and educational aspects of construction engineering. This paper explores the link between BIM implementation and onsite construction activity as experienced in a classroom setting. Starting with the design of a 36-unit multifamily residential project, students used BIM software to avoid conflict and enhance coordination ahead of actual construction. Live cost data were used to guide and inform the design process. This allowed students to make changes to building assemblies and components with an understanding of overall cost and schedule impact. Importantly, cross-discipline integration between design and construction dramatically decreased the time needed for cost estimating, planning and scheduling. It also facilitated reductions in consultant billings for specific civil, structural, and MEP design services. Through a case study approach, this paper validates the use of Building Information Modeling as an integrated format for construction education. It demonstrates the advantage which a comprehensive interface can provide to an engineering student; one which depicts the integration between design and construction services. In such an environment, students are able to simultaneously comprehend both how the building is designed, and how it will be constructed. While additional research regarding the use of BIM\u2019s is underway by the authors, the findings contained herein point towards a larger role for its use in future projects and education. Introduction For centuries, the roles of architect and constructor were intertwined as \u2018master builder\u2019. The knowledge of building materials and methods was implicit in the process of design. Indeed, innovations in buildings stemmed as much from creating new means of construction as they did from new building forms. Invariably, this tradition continued until the renaissance when the use of perspective representation and orthographic drawing was introduced. With these new forms of communicating information about buildings, the processes of building became increasingly legalistic, codified, complex and adversarial. In fact, today\u2019s standard AIA contracts state that \u201cthe architect will not be responsible for construction means, methods, techniques or procedures.\u201d1 Fortunately, the introduction of Building Information Modeling (BIM) holds promise for ending the disassociation between constructing and designing, thereby paving the way for an increase in building innovations and the potential return of the \u2018master builder\u2019 role. Software that allows for the three dimensional (3D) construction of a virtual building (i.e., BIM) will increasingly impact project delivery and the resulting interaction between architects,", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2562662773"}}

The article is dedicated to creation of 3D libraries of building construction elements with customized annotations, analytical and other necessary parameters for interior walls, doors, windows, exterior walls, floor slabs, roof, ceiling and floor elements in REVIT software. The aim of the work is to develop a database of families of parameterized components of buildings and structures in REVIT. The research was conducted using the method of generalization, systematic approach and statistical analysis. The matter of creating families of digital components of the virtual model of construction projects in accordance to the state norms and technical requirements is relevant now. Issues of creation and application of families of digital parameterized components according to requirements of current regulatory documents, interior and exterior components, as well as the structural component of each created element are described in the article. Some of the created families conform to the specified requirements, are universal and having an ability to replace types families.

The authors present the outcomes of the large-scale project BIM4INFRA2020 initiated by the government that helped to pave the way towards the German BIM mandate through a number of measures, including the precise definition of the BIM implementation on the basis of well-defined use cases, the guidance and supervision of a number of carefully selected pilot projects, the creation of extensive guidelines and handouts, and the formulation of measures to be taken by industry and government to overcome yet existing hurdles.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3042298566"}}

Japan has long-term automation experience in several manufacturing industries. Recently, players of the real estate and building sector have turned strategic attention and research investments to the automation of building operations, aware of the business relevance of the occupancy phase of facilities. This investigation analyzed R&D programs and experimental projects in Japan to foresee the role of BIM in the automation of building operations. A survey of disclosed information helped to understand the trends in automation research with the adoption of digital technologies for immediate and future use. Appliances from electronics manufacturers have been incorporated into complex cyber-physical systems to communicate with the built facility through a BIM-IoT framework. The evolution of ICT has influenced building management systems attributes which require new definitions of the set of data to be delivered and maintained by project players. There is recent evidence of efforts to turn BIM as the platform that creates, manages and also stores information for future BIM-FM uses, even though the integration with BAS/BEMS is not fully solved.

The analysis is based on the selection of the possible land and the review of the urbanistic laws that determine the legal parameters for the study of the implantation and the volume of the enterprise on the selected land. Therefore, it aims to use Building Information Modeling (BIM) as a tool to automate the process of feasibility analysis of legal parameters, such as the verification of land use and occupation law. Thereby, a volumetric model of the building in BIM will be built, followed by the modeling of the chosen land and finally, the normative and legal parameters will be assigned through the graphical programming tool, using Dynamo, a programming software to automate work on Revit. The project will be deployed to each selected land with its respective parameters.

The use of 4D BIM has been spreading, with significant scientific production in the area. The advantages of using it are notorious and well documented, highlighting the visualization of the work execution, increasing the comprehension and reliability of the planning. However, the need for 4D BIM support in the correct use of usual planning methods and techniques has been little emphasized and demonstrated in the literature. The study of 4D BIM applications in strategic construction planning has also been poorly documented, with simpler modelling and without the need for significant changes in the usual hiring processes for projects. This article aims to: demonstrate that the use of 4D BIM requires a consistent and reliable planning basis; to propose, based on the context of the Brazilian residential real estate market, a 4D BIM modelling method to support strategic construction planning decisions. In order to meet these objectives, a literature review was made, as well as basic concepts and the presentation of a case study. The case study is the planning of executing a residential complex with three towers of multiple floors, typical of real estate developments in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. Two plans of attack regarding the execution of the work are simulated and visualized. The results are analysed and discussed based on the literature and conceptual considerations presented. The conclusion was by the feasibility and utility of applying the 4D BIM, considering the adopted assumptions, method and tools used. The main difficulty is the modelling time. This stems not only from the project as a whole, but also from the increase resulting from the modelling of complementary activities, such as wood forms, scaffolding, protection screens, and others. Limitations of the application used were identified. Even so, the expenditure of work is compatible with the final quality of the visualization and the benefits provided to planning and decision making. The method could be used without the need for significant changes in the usual project and planning contracting processes in the real estate market in Brazil. It was confirmed that 4D BIM requires the correct use of the usual planning techniques and tools However, it requires training the planner in 3D modelling and 4D BIM.

Fire safety regulations impose very strict requirements on building design, especially for buildings built with combustible materials. It is believed that it is possible to improve the management of these regulations with a better integration of fire protection aspects in the building information modeling (BIM) approach. A new BIM-based domain is emerging, the automated code checking, with its growing number of dedicated approaches. However, only very few of these works have been dedicated to managing the compliance to fire safety regulations in timber buildings. In this paper, the applicability to fire safety in the Canadian context is studied by constituting and executing a complete method from the regulations text through code-checking construction to result analysis. A design science approach is used to propose a code-checking method with a detailed analysis of the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) in order to obtain the required information. The method starts by retrieving information from the regulation text, leading to a compliance check of an architectural building model. Then, the method is tested on a set of fire safety regulations and validated on a building model from a real project. The selected fire safety rules set a solid basis for further development of checking rules for the field of fire safety. This study shows that the main challenges for rule checking are the modeling standards and the elements\u2019 required levels of detail. The implementation of the method was successful for geometrical as well as non-geometrical requirements, although further work is needed for more advanced geometrical studies, such as sprinkler or fire dampers positioning.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3042131196"}}

At the present moment, building designs in Thailand tend to encounter many delays due to the design process.\u00a0 Redundant work results in a much longer working period which then results in a waste of human resources and time. This can also cause mistakes in the construction of a contractor\u2019s building. Studying building information modeling, or BIM, is a cost-effective solution for the design process. Powerful tools, (coupled with a 3D Printer) during the design process will assist in removing redundant tasks and also provide more accuracy in modeling. We can also remove the error of overlooking and miscalculating material costs by using some obtained data to compare values, worth, construction times and also check for correct implementation of construction standards. We can also translate our files to be used with 3D printers to further our data analysis of a particular construction.\u00a0 Research also shows that designing a building the time for BIM and is much more accurate than strictly using physical human resources. Additionally, we can implement BIM data into Revit to create /design 3D buildings at a much faster rate. Construction of a 3D model also will allow us to break our building / design into parts that can be assembled or disassembled to further see details of a building which can be used in correlation of construction standards and also to see floor plan layouts in a more structured order. A 3D model allows for us to check for consistency and accuracy by producing a small-scale version of a project without the need to start a construct only to find out flaws and miscalculations which would result in possible losses of value, time and human resources.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3043699835"}}

Construction architectures draw a new world pattern. Designing innovative shapes and their building cost a fortune and investors expect the relevant return in money and population benefits. Some of the representative examples of expensive constructive creativity are wide highways, bridges, skyscrapers, grand halls, malls, tall flats, etc. Each newly started or finalized construction must operate with a smart fault-tolerant risk management mechanism because the world has been a witness of many construction failures. They lead to additional reversible and irreversible damages, some of which cost people's lives. In 2018 the road viaduct in Genoa collapsed. As a result of the tragedy, at least thirty-eight people died, thirty-five cars and three trucks fall. In the basement of that collapse are a wrong construction project, the neglected need for reconstruction and the lack of a system to inform citizens about the bridge condition. Such accidents bear the question of how to prevent similar situations in advanced. Bridge engineering is difficult for standardization, therefore there is a need for a new technique to handle the issue. The authors of the report examine the way modern information and communication technologies impact quality control. The researchers make a relevant scientific literature review. They explore qualitative, quantitative and statistical methods of evaluation and apply computer comparison and modelling to create a new form for measuring and controlling the quality and strength of bridges.

Despite the advancements in digital technologies, the current building design examination practice is 2D and paper-based, and a large number of 2D plans and drawings need to be collated and interpreted to examine if the proposed designs comply with building regulations. Subsequently, it is prone to human errors that make sustainable and consistent design difficult. Although Building Information Modelling (BIM) is recognised as a means to transform the current practice into a more sustainable and productive practice, BIM has rarely been adopted in building design examination. This research aims to identify the reasons for the low uptake of BIM and to examine the feasibility of BIM for building design examination through a focus group interview and workshop. A lack of proper BIM training is identified as the most critical barrier to adopting BIM. Building design examiners indicate that BIM adoption requires consistent efforts with empirical errors, since the existing work processes are not flexible enough to embrace BIM instantly without proper BIM training. An average of three days can be saved by using BIM for a building regulations check.

Maintainability is not traditionally considered in the design of buildings. This is partly because design tools seldom facilitate the involvement of facility managers. They do not have rules for checking maintainability either. Consequently, buildings often have components or systems that are challenging to access for maintenance. To access the components, maintenance personnel suffer from falls, bruises, and cuts. This paper presents the development of an automated system for capturing the inputs of facility managers regarding the accessibility of building components for maintenance. The system integrates building information models, Microsoft azure and virtual reality for engaging facility managers in the design phase. The functionality and usability of the system are presented with an example of lighting and air-conditioning systems. The system provides a platform for mining and extracting knowledge from feedbacks provided by facility managers, which is significant for improving building design tools.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3013622000"}}

The grounded propositions in this study hold that the limited opportunities for inductive reasoning and reflective assessment of workflows in projects can press project parties into identifying alternative workflows through cognitive search and abductive reasoning.

Engineering design review is the process of assessing a design against codes and standards requirements to validate the accuracy and quality of the design and detecting problems before manufacturing and assembly begin. Building design regulations are normally in the form of texts, charts, tables, and mathematical expressions. These regulations and guidelines usually have legal status. Nevertheless, the cognitive and logical ability of the people is dissimilar to anything executed in computing machines. Consequently, the computerization of this process represents an actual challenge to the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Most of the cited methods for automated rules compliance auditing are either based on proprietary, domain-specific, or hard-coded rule-based representations, which may be useful in their specific applications. However, these methods have the disadvantages of being costly to maintain, cumbersome to modify, and lacking a comprehensive schema of rules and regulations modeling that can adapt to different domains, and thus don\u2019t support an open data standard.

Maintenance of each building along with every component and its facilities is needed to provide smooth and comfortable activities in the building. Often the building maintenance process/activity has not been able to run properly due to a lot of information such as maintenance records, work drawings (as-built drawings), types of assets, specifications, repair, and maintenance history that have not been recorded or stored properly. Most building maintenance systems currently only focus on existing information or records. The proposed information system is to utilize 3D modeling techniques namely BIM (Building Information Modeling), which through this BIM will be able to capture relevant information according to the data in the building. The technology used is the BIM (Building Information Modeling) technology using the SketchUp program. This method is by making a model of the building and its facilities. Modeling is done by giving visual data in 3D (three dimensions) to resemble the original object. The benefit of 3D (three-dimensional) modeling is that it provides clearer information because the visualization displayed is the same as the original object at the location, so just looking at the 3D model is quite the same as seeing the original object at the location. This research resulted in an information system in the form of three-dimensional visual model images that can be accessed easily. This concludes that an integrated Building Information Modeling (BIM) based system can provide useful functions in building maintenance quickly and accurately.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3090593063"}}

In recent years, due to the advantages of high construction efficiency and less environmental pollution, prefabricated housing has been of increasing interest and vigorously promoted. However at present, most prefabricated houses simply pursue an increase in assembly rate, and the floor plan design still continues to follow the traditional design method of housing, which does not meet the requirements of industrialization and cannot achieve the goal of product diversification. This paper puts forward a method for floor plan designs of prefabricated houses whose core is building plane module libraries. The modules in module libraries all conform to standardized and refined designs. A new residential floor plan can be obtained by selecting and recombining modules in module libraries. The richer the module library, the more diverse the results will be under the same combinatorial logic, which can greatly improve design efficiency. In addition, this paper probes the method of creation and applications of plane module libraries in detail, so as to provide a new idea for floor plan designs of prefabricated houses.

Introduction. When designing buildings and installations, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is spread more and more widely. The adoption of national and international standards and classifications is of great importance for the implementation of information technology. Application of the BIM-technologies for constructing public buildings, in the first turn, medical ones, seems to be very promising. The paper discusses the problems of developing indigenous parametric blocks (families) and preparatory activities in using the BIM-technology.&#x0D; Materials and methods. One of the information technology tasks is to develop equipment specifications and transfer them through the technological chain of the construction facility life cycle. The creation and application of classifiers are necessary to prepare for using the BIM-technologies.&#x0D; Results. A project of an academic health science centre with an extensive equipment range is analysed. The project of a modern medical building contains a description of several hundreds of specific medical equipment types. The specifications should contain information, including denominations and quantities of the equipment units, data on overall dimensions and weights of the units, connection interfaces to the power supply, water supply, water drainage. When creating parametric blocks, the international classifiers Uniclass-2015 and OmniClass are often used. However, they do not cover the necessary equipment range and contradict the domestic practice of purchasing equipment and services for state demand.&#x0D; Conclusions. The cost of preparing for the design process as creating parametric blocks can make a total of tens or hundreds of man-days that should be taken into account when planning design activities. In terms of procurement for state and municipal demand, it is necessary to make design specifications following the available range of medical equipment.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3005971505"}}

BIM is also being pushed by European governments; it is already a requirement for public projects in several countries, such as the United Kingdom or Denmark among others. In Spain, BIM is required for architectural projects since 2018 and it will be compulsory for all infrastructure projects in 2019. When applying the BIM methodology to MEP (Mechanical Electrical and Plumbing) projects, it makes maintenance easier, as it is a digital model of the installation that considers the operation period.

It contains different structure types of buildings and infrastructures including water, refuse, electricity, gas, communication utilities, roads, railways, bridges, ports and tunnels. The application of BIM in the building industry is relatively widespread while the development of BIM method in the domain of infrastructure is yet in infancy. In this research, we would like to study the compatibility of BIM in modeling the bridge by using Autodesk Revit. In this chapter, two data exchanging open standards that are mostly used in BIM, in the field of bridge modeling, including IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) and CityGML (Geography Markup Language) are reviewed. A parametric 3D bridge model is established with Autodesk Revit in order to carry out an experiment on bridge information modeling. The Raymond Barre Bridge in Lyon, France is used as case study. We have divided the process of modeling the bridge to two steps. The first step is structuring the bridge elements, which means to generate the different parts of the bridge including the foundations, deck parts, diaphragms and bowstring; and the next step is to assemble the deck parts and placement of bridge elements. In the modeling process, a large number of customer families are created to represent the missing bridge entities that could result in the information loss in IFC file. We show that the current IFC is not well developed for bridges and it is needed to define specific entities dedicated to the bridge domain. We also refer to the other research in this domain and their suggestions for extending IFC for bridges such as bridge data dictionary, information delivery manual, missing concepts and new entities for IFC-bridge.

The construction industry has in general been rather slow in its implementation of new digital solutions compared to other industries. To date, only a handful of material suppliers are offering a service of so-called digital BIM-objects of their products. These 'digital product copies' can be utilized in projects' BIM-models for several purposes, being favorable to the design team and contractors. The advantages related to digitalization in connection to material suppliers have not been studied to a greater degree; hence this fact forms a ground for this study. The purpose of this study is to challenge the analog methods and processes that traditionally have been, and are still practiced widely. In a broader perspective, this study aims to encourage more material suppliers to create digital BIM-objects by answering how this could be a competitive strategy. This study is designed as a collective case study, including four different material suppliers on the Swedish market being at the forefront of digitalization. Their digital journey and experiences constitute a great resource to share within the construction industry. Each case in this collective case study represents a type of building component, namely; windows (1), profile and ventilation sheets (2), facade systems (3), and doors (4). Empirical data was collected through semi-structured interviews. Except from the material suppliers in the collective cases, also a selection of their partners participated. A total of nine interviews were performed, resulting in a total of 12 interviewees. The interviews' raw data was used to generate a thematic structure. This structure organized the empirics to simplify the after-coming interpretation and analysis. This study shows that users to the digital BIM-objects, such as digitalized designers and contractors, tend to work toward those material suppliers who can offer continuously developed and well-supported digital BIM-object. Also, combining digital BIM-objects with close relations could potentially generate invitations to an early phase of projects where the material supplier in question is later being procured in a somewhat streamlined and digital process. This manner still relies on innovative pilot-projects since analog methods are in the majority. However, efforts today could ensure the material suppliers not be out-of-competition for future projects as arising new digital and open mindsets pave the way.

Design-Build-Relocate (DBR) projects refer to architecture that presents temporality in its existence. Buildings that are created to be dismantled, disassembled, moved, relocated, reused. Buildings that, from the moment of their concept idea, are designed directly connected to the sense of a limited useful lifetime. Therefore, they must be designed to be deconstructed. Advances and progress in the History of Architecture are reflected in the experimentation of design for temporary buildings. In the contemporary digital era in which we live in, technological advances are an ideal scenario to innovate and experiment new solutions for DBR projects. These types of constructions must allow high levels of flexibility and versatility throughout advanced and automated technological responses, in a world where changes and innovations must have a strong focus on the economy of resources, lean concepts for waste management, and reuse and recycle principles.

The implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry has significantly amplified the responsibility of designers in creating reliable and accurate BIM models. Fundamentally, the BIM models must comply with the fire safety regulations to provide minimum protection for building occupants and property. Since fire safety regulations are known to be complex and rigid, the manual compliance checking process could lead to inaccuracies, especially in a BIM-based environment. Hence, this study developed an automated BIM-based fire regulations compliance checking system for Malaysian\u2019s AEC industry. In order to establish the rules and BIM properties necessary for fire regulations compliance checking process, 256 clauses from Parts VII and VIII of Selangor Uniform Building (Amendment) (No. 2) By-Laws 2012 were selected to create a BIM model using Revit\u00ae based on two-dimensional drawings of a completed 17-storey institutional building. Three investigations were conducted to structure the representation of the rules and BIM properties. First, the fire safety clauses were formalised through a classification technique, semantic mark-up requirement, applicability, selection, exception (RASE) methodology, and interviewing two fire engineers and a representative from the Fire and Rescue Department Malaysia (JBPM). Secondly, the BIM properties consisting of 54 families and their respective parameters in Revit\u00ae were identified for the compliance checking process. Lastly, pseudocodes and architecture of the automated system were developed to establish the relationship between the formalised clauses and BIM properties. Dynamo\u00ae scripts were used to develop a prototype of an automated fire regulations compliance checking system which could automatically check for fire doors and staircases in Revit\u00ae. The representative from JBPM, three fire engineers and architect validated the proposed architecture while the prototype was validated by three architects, two structural engineers, one mechanical engineer, and two civil engineers. This study contributed to a semi-automated rule translation process which combined existing approaches in this field of study. The classification technique and semantic mark-up RASE methodology were refined in this research by developing flowcharts to provide specific guidelines in formalising the clauses.

Available research papers about integration of BIM into the process of real construction are analyzed and the urgency and necessity of development of the given industry in the modern world are proved. Results. Application of information model in reconstruction of architectural engineering sites is investigated. The technique of real model scanning of a building for the creation of information model is presented. The examples of nanosensors use for synchronization of the real construction site with its information model are given. The importance of orientation in the building using GIS and BIM communication has been established. In this review, I would like to show the importance of information modeling for Russia. Conclusions. The opportunity to combine such technologies as photogrammetry, laser scanning and ReCap software features with automated monitoring of images taken from various devices is presented.

We are at a stage where Building Information Modelling (BIM) has reached a maturity level to be widely adopted by the professionals and organizations within the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. An industry which is highly fragmented and not advanced in terms of digitalization, making an effective collaboration hard to achieve. The advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have brought about the promise of improving collaborative procedure in a wide range of industries. The widespread adoption of BIM has paved the way for the introduction of ICT within the AEC sector. The reported benefits of BIM imply on its potential for contributing to a successful inter-disciplinary collaboration. This calls for attention from architects who shall consider how BIM allows the architectural practices to operate in truly novel ways to achieve new building efficiencies and organizations. This research was designed to investigate the crucial factors for an effective collaboration based on advanced ICT and enabled by BIM with respect to architectural practices. An effective inter-disciplinary collaboration allows architects as the authors of the projects to oversee the development and delivery of the projects more consistently with their design intends. The concerns about the move towards adopting BIM by architectural firms were reviewed and its influential factors and barriers were discussed. As we read about it, BIM is indicated by different terms to describe its essence: \u2018\u2019BIM methodology\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019BIM technology\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019BIM process\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019BIM systems\u2019\u2019 and etc. However, none of these terms can include all aspects of BIM. The term \u2018\u2019ecosystem\u2019\u2019 was adopted to describe the nature of BIM and the reason for which is described in this work. To further constitute the BIM ecosystem, its dimensions of People, Products and Processes were presented in detail with respect to collaborative procedures. It included the delineation of a number of BIM policies and protocols, tools and technologies, roles and skills which are all related to and suitable for architectural practices in their interdisciplinary collaboration. Through three case studies, the research questions and hypothesis were put into investigation. Based on the idea of change management and the socio-technical nature of BIM collaboration, a qualitative research approach was adopted. Various techniques were used to gather information to be analyzed through a coding process of the qualitative data. The codes were interpreted as the factors influencing collaboration and were grouped to form the crucial concepts contributing to effective BIM-enabled collaborative procedures. It was revealed that the \u201cjoint decision making\u201d factor is the most crucial one in this respect followed by \u201ccollaboration involvement\u201d and \u201cinteroperability\u201d. These findings were based on the frequency of the codes related to these factors in the data analysis. The crucial concepts in BIM-enabled collaboration were revealed to be \u201ccollaboration conditions\u201d followed by \u201csoftware capacity\u201d and \u201chuman resources organization\u201d. The findings confirm the research hypotheses that BIM implementation asks architects to assume a leadership role in collaborative procedures and that it allows for the integration of ICT into the technological pipeline of architectural practices. However, the validity of the two hypotheses is subject to certain conditions that are discussed in this work. The research finds the area of BIM education a place of great interest for future research work as the factor of \u201ctraining\u201d has a great influence on the overall success of BIM-enabled collaboration.

Disruptive innovations of the 4th industrial revolution are now starting to make an impact on construction. Although construction has lagged behind some of the other industries in embracing this revolution, recent years have seen a concentrated effort to drive change in construction processes and practices. The 4th industrial revolution is characterised by technologies such as digitisation, optimisation, and customisation of production, automation and adaptation; as well as processes such as human machine interaction; value-added services and businesses, and automatic data exchange and communication. In construction, the applications of Industry 4.0 include 3D printing of building components, autonomous construction vehicles, the use of drones for site and building surveying, advanced offsite manufacturing facilities etc. The application of technologies, processes associated with Industry 4.0 is seen to be already making an impact on construction, and reshaping the future of built environment. This new digital era of construction, fuelled by Industry 4.0, has significant potential to enhance disaster resilience practices in the built environment. Knowledge on resilience of the built environment including preparedness, response and recovery has advanced significantly over the recent years and we are now in an era where resilience is seen as a key constituent of the built environment. But the recurring and devastating impacts of disasters constantly challenge us to improve our practices and seek ways of achieving greater heights in our quest of achieving a resilient built environment. It is often proposed that the innovations associated with Industry 4.0 joined by IoTs and sensors can be exploited to enhance the ability of the built environment to prepare for and adapt to climate change and withstand and recover rapidly from the impacts of disasters. This integration of cyber physical systems through IoTs needs a holistic view of disaster resilience. Often, the focus is on benefits individual technologies can offer. However, the ability to integrate different aspects of disaster resilience using a range of new technologies promise to deliver wider benefits beyond and above what individual technologies can offer. For instance, an integrated digital twin allows to bring together advanced risk modelling, big data, cloud computing, internet of things, advanced off-site manufacturing, etc. together to deliver a resilient built environment. This requires careful planning and extensive research on the complexities surrounding disaster resilience related aspects and the use of related data. The ultimate objective of any new innovation, including Industry 4.0, should ideally be to benefit the society. The society that we live today is often disrupted by natural hazard induced disasters, whether it be floods, cyclones, earthquakes, landslides or tsunamis. The challenge that is in front of us is to effectively utilise new innovations driven by digital information to enhance disaster resilience in our buildings, communities, cities and regions. However, unlike earlier industrial revolutions, digital revolution is not easy to control. We must ensure that the fundamental values such as freedom, openness and pluralism are inbuilt in these new technologies. This is an uncharted territory for us. In addition to addressing complexities and challenges of using Industry 4.0 technologies, we also need to have policies and guidelines on the use of information. There should be a balance between innovation and regulation. We are confident that by bringing together researchers, practitioners and policy-makers alike from relevant disciplines we can deliver realistic benefits to transform our disaster resilience practices and policies, and make the built environment we live in more resilient.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2992050200"}}

These computer simulations challenged the existing practice of representing a building through plan, section and elevation, proposing that one computational model could create a more efficient way of building. The history of BIM explorations and applications, while hardly linear, can be traced back to developments in computing since the post-war period. This article maps some of these histories by examining how the computational model became an organisational infrastructure, collecting data about design and building parameters, and facilitating knowledge transfer across industries.

Off-site construction and building information model (BIM) technology bring benefits to the construction industry in many respects, such as reduced material waste, and lead to solutions towards sustainable construction. Nevertheless, despite the uptake of off-site construction methods and BIM, massive construction waste in terms of sheathing material (e.g., oriented strand board) is still yielded in the light-frame building industry. This research thus presents an automated BIM-based approach to reducing sheathing material waste by enabling a proactive design and planning of roof sheathing installation for prefabricated buildings. Specifically, a BIM-based sheathing layout design algorithm, which incorporates trades know-how, is developed to achieve the construction design automation. A hybrid algorithm integrating greedy algorithm and particle swarm algorithm is applied in connection with the design algorithm to optimize material cutting plans for the generated layout with the objective of minimizing sheathing material waste. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of roof sheathing material waste reduction.

The article describes a new approach for the design of a construction object.Information modeling of a building is an approach to design, construction, equipping, ensuring responsible operation and repair of a building (to control the life cycle of an object), which consists in accumulation and complex processing in the process of designing all architectural-design, technological, economic and other information about a building with all its interconnections and dependencies, when the building and the objects of its life support are considered as a single system.A three-dimensional model of a building or other construction object associated with a database in which each element of the model can be assigned all the necessary attributes. The peculiarity of this approach is that the construction object is designed in fact as a single whole: The change of any of its parameters automatically changes in its parameters and objects, up to drawings, visualization, specifications and calendar graphics.The use of the information model goes beyond the planning and design phase of the project, covering the entire life cycle of the building and supporting all processes, including cost management, construction management, project management, site operation and environmental management.\u0412IM is a process of optimization of design and construction.

Therefore, a feasibility study has been carried out including the surveying of real-world landscape objects like terrain, buildings, ways and paths, playgrounds, and retaining walls, in order to use actual existing objects instead of idealized, theoretical elements. The aim was to develop and evaluate a workflow from the surveying over the modeling in BIM-able software to the export of an IFC data file.

The study adopted a quantitative research design using a structured empirical questionnaire survey. Also, a comparative analysis of the perceptions of the respondents\u2019 groupings was conducted. The major barriers to BIM adoption are related to the inherent resistance to change by construction stakeholders, inadequate organizational support and structure to execute BIM, and lack of BIM industry standards in Hong Kong.

Abstract Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a technology designed to improve and integrate all engineering aspects in the construction design process. Tools that incorporate the idea of BIM are becoming more advanced and also more popular. Available software solutions have already reached an assumable high level of development, but still are not as widespread and used on nearly as many construction projects as could be expected. Therefore the aim of this paper is to show the advantages and limitations of BIM by looking at projects of small and middle sized buildings from the conventional (2D) and BIM approach perspective. The study was based on the present projects executed in Poland and first-hand experience. In addition, the paper also presents a literature review and the results of a survey on the level of knowledge and scope of BIM technology application in Pomerania (Poland). The results of the study indicate that, against common opinion, BIM software is not only useful for large investments, but can also be recommended for the design of small and middle sized buildings. Presented case study reveals, that the use of BIM in smaller projects also provides significant advantages, especially in the context of time consumed for the design process.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2973723071"}}

The authors use the data of in-depth process analysis to assess a defined catalogue of basic requirements for BIM methodology in the building permit process. As a result, the analysed BIM-integrated approach enables an early-stage identification of approval compliance, which can be evaluated in the building permit process.

Therefore, this study aims to develop a low-cost and efficient mobile laser scanning method that can be integrated with 5D BIM to realize indoor mapping and digital modelling for maintenance cost estimation and planning of building fabric components under the indoor environment of a typical case study in China. In this study, the low-cost and efficient mobile laser scanning method is developed based on an integration of two common indoor positioning techniques - the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) system with an inexpensive and portable 2D laser scanner. By using developed algorithmic solutions, a motion trajectory provided by the indoor positioning techniques can be combined with 2D scan profiles from the laser scanner to generate a 3D point cloud, which shows reality captures from building fabric components existing in the indoor environment. This developed mobile laser scanning method can make a significant contribution to discovering the real conditions of fabric components for better maintenance planning. In addition, through the empirical investigations of BIM-based workflows for design coordination and impact factors influencing both construction process and maintenance management, a knowledge link between the O&M phase with design and construction phases also has been discovered to help explore solutions for improving the performances and productivities throughout the project lifecycle in the future.  As there are a few studies that focus on the BIM applications in the cost estimation and planning for the maintenance purpose of building fabric components, even there are rare case studies about indoor mapping and digital modelling applied into building fabric maintenance, this PhD study realizes significant achievements to narrow the knowledge gap between the global BIM development and China\u2019s local BIM development through the heterogeneous integration of laser scanning with 5D BIM particularly for digitalization of building fabric maintenance in China. Meanwhile it organically establishes a consistent knowledge link between facility O&M phase with design and construction phases to implement a sustainable project lifecycle management. Therefore, the novelty of the study has been guaranteed and its value to relevant research domains including 3D imaging and facility management also has been proved in the thesis. Future improvements and research work based on the outcome of this study also have been discussed.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2955689564"}}

The construction industry is also facing a severe test while it is developing rapidly. As the most sought-after application technology in the area of engineering construction, BIM is receiving more and more attention and practice. Today, the application of BIM technology in architecture has matured, but the application in landscape design is still in the exploration stage. BIM technology mainly emphasizes the complete life cycle of planning, design, construction, completion operation, and demolition and update, the construction information of each stage is built into 3D virtual through the structure of 3D information model.

The process of building design is a means of meeting client expectations for a building, followed by a set of comprehensive standards and codes relating to the design, construction, and maintenance of buildings. The rapidly rising volume of data along with increasing client expectations inspired many researchers to develop new computerized techniques to automate building design process. These techniques can be broken down into two broad categories: automated computer-aided design tools (e.g., development of building information modeling or BIM) and measuring or modeling client expectations (e.g., use of facial expressions to find psychological expectations of the client). Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have made possible new approaches to the automation of design. This represents a shift from a focus on client-designer or designer-technology relationships to a more intelligent and independent client-technology communication. In this paper, a novel AI system called intelligent designer is proposed to understand (or learn) the client's need and expectations and generate valid designs. The design environment (i.e., the interaction between the client and the design) is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and a mathematical framework is provided for making design decisions in situations where new designs are partly random (as they are influenced by the client's feedback) and partly under the control of the computer (as they are influenced by the regulations, standards, and guidelines).

Previous research efforts have sought to address the inherent lack of efficiency and productivity through various tools and techniques. This article proposes a framework that could facilitate the effective coordination of building services during the design, development, and review stages in building projects in Saudi Arabia. The framework was developed based on an investigation of the current professional practices in building services coordination. The developed framework model consists of five sequential processes: (1) develop the conceptual project design; (2) develop the preliminary design; (3) prepare the developed design of the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) services; (4) prepare the detailed design of MEP services; and (5) prepare the construction documents of MEP services. The framework was developed in the integrated definition for function modeling (IDEF0) graphical format.

Building Information Modeling Technology offers state-of-the-art solutions that allow the design of a building to create in many variants a realistically time-consuming development process and, by virtue of an almost fully automatic assessment of the variants, choose the most appropriate one according to the required criteria. Such a design of the building assumes its optimal behavior according to the criteria required by the investor, the user and other stakeholders, but also helps to keep the construction towards the sustainable development goals. There are many existing buildings that have obsolete properties. The management and durability of such buildings is very costly. Such buildings should be refurbished to meet the properties and imitations of new building behavior. 3D scanning technology goes hand in hand with the building sector digitization and outputs from 3D scanning technology serves as a useful basis for further working with data using BIM technology.

Still, automated code compliance checking has not yet been fully realized, as there is no standardized method for rule interpretation and building model preparation for code compliance. Manual verification of design code compliance, meanwhile, requires significant effort and time and is error-prone, while uncertainty and inconsistency in assessment lead to delays in the construction process. In this paper, the development of a prototype to automate municipal bylaw and wall framing code compliance checking for residential building is presented. The building rules have been classified into three groups based on the complexity involved in translation into computer-readable format and complexity in retrieving the required information, and they are represented based on building objects, which makes the regulations easier to understand and assists in translating the regulations into a computer-readable format. By creating a model view based on the required element\u0092s parameters extracted from a model for checking purposes, the prototype application offers automated code compliance checking functionality to validate designs based on building code requirements and construction engineering specifications. The implementation of the prototype and its benefits compared to manual checking is demonstrated.

Building information modelling (BIM) technology has the potential to improve communication among multiple stakeholders and to streamline construction projects. In order for the BIM model to be fit for use in the construction field generally and in modular construction projects specifically, it needs to be designed with sufficient construction details. However, in current practice, this requirement necessitates substantial manual modelling efforts, which limits the use of BIM in the construction field. In this context, the objective of this research is to automate BIM of construction details for modular construction (i.e., manufacturing-centric BIM) with a focus on the wood-framing design and modelling processes. Specifically, this paper presents a portion of the research undertaken at the University of Alberta to develop FrameX, an Autodesk Revit add-on under development for the purpose of automating the framing design of light-frame wood structures. It represents a rule-based modelling approach that is capable of analyzing and designing building frames automatically in accordance with building codes, transportation regulations for modular components, and industry-wide best practices. Various best practice scenarios described in this paper represent ways the industry is seeking to reduce the material, time, and effort required to manufacture prefabricated building panels. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the rule-based modelling approach and the prototyped system, FrameX. The results reveal that the prototype system, FrameX, can automatically output manufacturing-centric BIM model and shop drawings in accordance with formalized rules, to assist field specialists from the outset of a given construction project.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2954896328"}}

Even considering the specific context of pre-fabrication and modularization, it was just in recent years, with increasing adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) processes, that the challenge, albeit in a virtual environment, begins to be really addressed. With the advent of the Digitization phenomena in Construction, and the advances in Machine Learning techniques to cope with uncertainties of different natures in modelling real processes, it seems that the use of computational tools to simulate off-site production should be reconsidered. In this article, it is adopted an approach in viewing BIM as in a development stage to become an implementation of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) for Construction. Towards this end, it is identified the lack of representation of the entire dynamics of production processes inside BIM models. The proposition of using Petri Nets with stochastic transitions to represent and simulate those processes are presented, altogether with the use of real RFID data, to adjust the model parameters, collected from a case study with a Brazilian company that pre-fabricate wood-framing houses. The probability distributions are derived based on the Mixture of Gaussians algorithm, and considers parameters of the design of wall panels \u0096 so it could be used to extrapolated performance for new designs. Following the presented approach, it is expected that, with more data, the simulation process could be a good feedback to architects in evaluating the impact of its design options in production.

However, low adoption outside the design phase entails that handling information in production is in many cases manual and paper-based, which increases vulnerability for upstream errors materialising downstream in production. Furthermore, issues with interoperability surround many areas when managing digital information. For industrialised house-builders, the transmitter and receiver of information are in many cases integrated within the same company or based on long-term collaboration. This affects their ability to manage information and utilise design information, which implies that their strategy for digital information management (DIM) might benefit from being addressed differently compared to more traditional BIM-based approaches. In this paper, we describe and discuss an implemented DIM-solution at an industrialised house-builder in order to address the benefits and challenges with DIM when managing information from design to production. The results imply that in order for several different functions within the company to reap benefits, a customised DIM-solution adapted after the company\u0092s specific needs is a well-suited approach forward to avoid sacrificing functionality when utilising design information.

First, what are the unique barriers facing the use of BIM in China's prefabricated construction? Second, how do these barriers interrelate with one another? This research aims to address these two questions. Conducting a two-round literature review and a questionnaire survey ascertained twelve barriers acutely affecting the Chinese experience of applying BIM to prefabricated construction. In addition, Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) was used to identify interrelationships among these barriers. The exercise found that, compared with the cost-related issues suggested by previous studies that focused on general BIM implementation barriers, the lack of research about BIM in China and the absence of standards and domestic-oriented tools are likely the biggest hindrances to the practical application of BIM in China's prefabricated construction. This study contributes to the knowledge body by revealing major barriers to BIM implementation in China's prefabricated construction and crafting a corresponding three-level strategy to facilitate the possible implementation. The findings of this study can thus act as a practical reference for future research attempting to provide technological and managerial solutions to improve BIM implementation in China's prefabricated construction.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2914732162"}}

Historical buildings are always at risk to great danger strike by fire, flood and other potential disasters affecting the building conditions. Thus positive and continuous actions need to be taken to preserve the heritage buildings or else a country might lose its cultural heritage value. In managing historic buildings, managers are often faced with complex decision-making process due to limited or unavailability of reliable information. The absence of such information influenced the way decision making and problem-solving made by the managers. This paper aims to highlight the potentials of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a decision support system for cultural heritage management. An embedded case study was conducted on Istana Balai Besar Kota Bharu, focusing on the changes of the historical building's layout to demonstrate the ontology. A measured drawing dated back in 1976 was used together with the terrestrial laser scanning activity performed presently on the physical building in creating a model in BIM environment. The result gives an overview about tracking information on changes within a historical building as part of cultural heritage management. This paper finds that by modelling the data captured by the 3D laser scanner and utilizing the existing data, BIM is capable of helping managers to retrieve, analyze and store important information in a more efficient and productive process. This exploration is substantial as a precursor to a much broader study on BIM for cultural heritage in the Malaysian context. As BIM is set to drive the construction industry, the finding made would be a catalyst for creating awareness to support the development of BIM for cultural heritage management in Malaysia.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2943407869"}}

The use and dissemination of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in architectural projects requires a new understanding of design, construction and management of the built environment. For an educator in architecture, teaching BIM requires a pedagogical approach to the use of parametric objects that go beyond the simpler 3D CAD model and contain data related with time, cost and life cycle management. A deeper understanding of the ways in which the use of BIM can influence the architectural practice can help us with mapping the strategies to integrate BIM in architectural education. In architectural practice, the use of BIM software brings a series of advantages that are easily identified, notably the use of 3D libraries to save time and the creation of a 3D BIM model to allow powerful visualisation. The use of BIM in architectural education may help students with acquiring a more holistic perspective of the discipline and with understanding the different areas of an architectural design project. However, the framework of BIM is probably too complex for a novice and can become detrimental in an early stage of architectural education. By the end of their undergraduate studies students are expected to contribute actively to architectural practice and respond to the needs of a rapid technological changes. Therefore, we need to carefully consider the best way to introduce and to integrate BIM in the curricula by using different design methods to experience all the dimensions of BIM without compromising the architectural design performance: \u2022 Live projects \u2013 the use BIM models to control costs, check the compliance with the design standards and sustainability analysis, \u2022 Post-Occupancy evaluation projects \u2013 the use BIM models to inform building performance, track maintenance experience and inform future projects, \u2022 Crossdisciplinarity projects \u2013 the use of BIM model to identify major clashes between different pieces of design and understand the different design responsibilities.

ABSTRACT Evaluating the structural integrity of curtain walls during the life cycle of a building project can assist architects in developing better designs, help contractors establish better installation methods, and allow facility managers make informed maintenance decisions. This paper presents an effort to develop a process which combines three types of technologies: 3D laser scanning, Building Information Modeling (BIM), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA), to evaluate the structural integrity of a curtain wall. In a case study, a 3D laser scanner was used to scan the curtain wall, the resulting set of point clouds was used to create an actual as-built BIM model. This \u201cas-is\u201d BIM model is different than a construction as-built BIM model in that the former model captures existing deformations developed during construction, installation, and maintenance phases. Then further analysis was completed using simulation with FEA using the BIM model to potentially predict any future structural issues. Wind loads on the building fa\u00e7ade and their effect on unintentional stresses built into the glass panel were studied. The final results inform of deformities in the curtain wall and show the amount of wind load the structure can support before there is a risk of structural damage. The contribution of this study is that the harmonious three-step technique quickens the entire process of identifying the risks to a building element. An additional use for these common software packages would be beneficial to all the stakeholders involved in the life cycle of the building, especially those concerned with the facilities management and the building life cycle.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2982423053"}}

At present, an increasing number of researchers and specialists in the construction industry come to the opinion that it is advisable to use a number of technologies (BIM, Smart City, Big Data, IOT and others) in the practice of construction (in the broad sense of this concept), which are united by the concept of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The result of the implementation of these technologies in the construction should be the transition to the widespread use of cyber-physical systems. The problem of using information technologies in construction today is not due to the lack of this process as such, but to the lack of consistency and consistency in it. Fragmentary nature of the application, inconsistency of the applied technologies at different levels of management and at different stages of the life cycle of construction projects sharply reduce the potential positive effect of informatization and building automation. At the same time, the concept of cyber-physical systems, that is, the integration at the system level of physical processes and controls has proven effective in industrial production. The approaches to ensuring the processes of designing cyber-physical building systems through the development and application of General mathematical models for the processes of data exchange and management are considered.

The BIM (Building Information Modeling) method is a new solution for the civil construction sector. In it, the designer is able to model the building as a whole in all its project stages, to compatibilize, to predict costs and prevent errors. Therefore, it reduces the deadlines and costs in the enterprise. The present work aims to compare two methods of project development: the BIM platform and the traditional method. It seeks to evaluate the advantages and limitations of the first method over the second. To this purpose, a residential building project was developed using the BIM platform. The architectural, electrical, plumbing and structural projects of a two-storey one-family house were carried out. After completion, the present project was compared with another professional who developed the same one, but in the traditional way. Subsequently, we investigated the advantages and challenges encountered during each stage. When comparing the projects, it was possible to find several projection errors, mostly human errors, caused by lack of attention or conference. Already in the compatibilization stage, one can perceive errors due to lack of initial communication among the project disciplines. With this comparison, it was possible to evaluate the advantages that BIM provides, as well as the points that still need development. In a second moment, it was possible to observe the potentiality of the use of BIM for the improvement of university teaching and Civil Construction projects as a whole.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3000190054"}}

Whereas over time in the current market the cost of each work is analyzed more closely, being a determining step for its realization. To be done more accurately and in a shorter time, civil engineering professionals who carry out projects and budgets are using new technologies and tools like BIM to achieve better results. In the present work, a comparison was made between three items of quantitative surveys performed by the conventional method and the method using the BIM model through the Revit program, being the items: masonry, roughcast and plaster. For this it was used the budget of a project already completed where the conventional quantitative survey was used. To make the comparison were modeled the structure, masonry, roughcast and plaster of the same project in the Revit program. With this it was possible to generate the quantitative survey through the BIM methodology.

The building construction industry is responsible for 60 percent of the raw materials extracted from the lithosphere. Raw materials are scarce but limited and must therefore be well documented so that they remain unlimited. With the help of the material passport, materials get an identity, which means that they can never disappear in anonymity as waste. In this research the central question was how a material passport in Madaster can be generated from a BIM-model and be kept up-to-date during the operation and maintenance phase of a building. Madaster is a platform were material passport can be generated from BIM-models. To study this question first the requirements of Madaster were compared to the specifications of BIM modeling standards. Secondly, data about the process of generating a material passport is collected with the help of interviews. The respondents of the interviews are employees of companies that have experience with generating a material passport in Madaster and an employee of Madaster. The results of this study showed that the input BIM-models for Madaster often lack data which means they do not meet the requirements of Madaster. Generating a material passport in Madaster from a BIMmodel should be an automatic process. However, there are some manually steps that needs to be taken. This study provides some optimization strategies to reduce the manually work needed to create a material passport and keep it up-to-date. Currently there is no motivation to keep a material passport up-to-date during the operation and maintenance phase. Certification and legislation of a material passport could increase the use of a material passport and make it common practice. Firstly, from this research appeared to generate a material passport in Madaster the BIM-models need to meet the requirements of Madaster which is often not the case. Secondly from this study appeared to keep a material passport up-to-date it is important that there are motivations such as tax deductions or legislations to motivate property owners to keep the material passport up-to-date. Generating material passport from the data in the BIM-models will give the materials in a building an identity, which means the materials cannot be treated as waste.

Thus, by considering appropriate timing and detail levels when applying construction knowledge, this study proposes a process for integrating constructability activities related to temporary work into the design phase in high-rise concrete buildings. Through an investigation of information-dependency relationships, 22 constructability activities were linked with 33 design activities. Further, these activities' implementation processes were constructed based on optimized information flows from a partitioned dependency structure matrix.

The application of a SI housing system involves two new characteristics compared to traditional cast-in-place housing system: components production in factories and site construction are carried out simultaneously; the skeleton system and the infill system are constructed in parallel phases, which increase enormous parallel work. Iterations and rework would increase with the improper handling of parallel works, which lead to higher construction cost and lower participant willingness of stakeholders in SI housing construction delivery process. It is essential to establish a model to clarify the dependencies among major parallel work items and recognize parallel work sets to optimize the construction sequence for stakeholders to strengthen communication and coordination on key work items in a more efficiency way. By conducting investigations into the construction delivery process of typical SI housing projects in China, this paper developed a parallel collaborative mode based on the design structure matrix (DSM) to identify the complex dependencies among major cooperative work items. Furthermore, to provide an optimized parallel collaborative process, graph theory was introduced to find parallel work sets and eliminate repetition and iteration caused by improper work execution sequences.

This paper presents the work performed by an undergraduate student group at the American University in Cairo as a first phase of their graduation project that mimics a state-of-the-art industrial experience in structural and geotechnical design of a high-rise building using building information model (BIM). A 3-D BIM was developed for the structure and used to generate an analytical model which is exported to a structural numerical analysis program, followed by a full design of the building elements and foundation. The considered building is 218 m high, in which the architectural design requires a successive 2-degrees twist per floor through the building height, resulting in a total twist of 80 degrees between the first and last floors. The architect also retracted the slabs every six stories from a group of columns, leaving 24 m-height laterally unsupported peripheral columns. As such, the vertical and horizontal building irregularities present challenges in the structural modeling and design and requires thorough analyses, particularly for seismic and wind considerations. Due to the high water table at the building site and the existence of a 12.5 underground basement, a special dewatering technique was proposed, along with the full tanking design consideration of the building basement.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3006231480"}}

Architecture, engineering and construction professional practices (e.g. architectural, engineering and contracting firms and practitioners) have pushed software developers to support standardised data formats and flows for importing, exporting and sharing building data. Recently, the widespread use and proliferation of object-oriented computer-aided design (CAD) packages together with the increased complexity and automation in the construction processes have fostered the uptake and exchange of 3D data during the collaboration process (Singh, Gu and Wang, 2011). Building information modelling (BIM) has facilitated this innovation in building design, construction and management. Through a single digital data repository, BIM shares and maintains an integrated digital representation of all building infor - mation throughout the entire project lifecycle (Gu and London, 2010). Creating a BIM ecosystem requires careful consideration for BIM-related products, processes and people to co-evolve (Gu, Singh and London, 2015). BIM supports powerful building data documentation and digitis - ation, and facilitates more effective com munication across different disciplines involved in the building lifecycle. It aims to break down the communication barriers among different stakeholders by maintaining only one consistent digital model for all disciplines through new processes of generating, managing and sharing building information.

The introduction of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is changing the work environment in the AEC industry. Many countries require the AEC industry to submit building documentation using BIM. For example BIM is a requirement to obtain funds the from European Union (EU); England, Dubai and California also require BIM for some typologies of building projects, and most countries are moving towards BIM as a must. It is therefore necessary to introduce BIM into the Architecture, Construction and Engineering curricula. These skills, abilities and methodology will increase student opportunities. Nowadays each institution and faculty introduces BIM in its own way as there is very little scientific literature about how to go about it. There are many proceedings about offering introductory BIM courses and documentation of those experiences, but few scientific publications are available, as there are for the introduction of new information management processes applied in other fields of science. This educational research aims to be a first step to create a BIM introduction framework providing scientific data. For this thesis we focused on the introduction of BIM based on Autodesk products in the construction courses of the United Arab Emirates University. Whereas in Spain architectural curricula is broad spectrum, in the UAE, US and many other countries the architect is not overseeing the structure, MEP and HVAC, and must rely on engineers; this study of BIM is based on the fact that the design and construction processes of a building are multidisciplinary work and coordinated by many different professionals, therefore BIM is the right tool. In the course of our research we have studied student academic performance, motivation and satisfaction using surveys, comparison of exercises, grades and student interviews, as well as the feedback of the professors. The analyzed data helped us to determine introduction problems, behaviors to avoid, and elements to take into account when introducing BIM-Revit in construction courses. This thesis ends with the evaluation of two different methodologies to introduce BIM in construction courses and a first step towards a BIM introduction guide.

The lack of \u201cAs Built\u201d documentation (building components, installations, etc.) and the complex task of detecting their current status in terms of use (intended use and space dimensions, environmental context, etc.) and maintenance (conservation status of building components, age of the technological installations, previous maintenance work, compliance with current regulations, etc.) causes deep difficulties in planning, scheduling and controlling appropriate interventions.

The impacts of BIM on Architectural Design. Building information modelling is an information delivery method that is made available for the use of architects and the other actors of the architecture, engineering and construction industry. In recent years, in many countries it became an obligatory project delivery mode for architects. As a result, prevailing use of this method alters the modes of notation and the logic of design in architectural offices. While architects used to employ representations of the design to communicate with other parties, with the BIM methods and software they are forced to create information models which can be regarded as simulations of a future building and are open to the control and revisions of other participants who are involved in building processes. Since it promotes a collaborative production and gathering whole information on a single model, it brings many opportunities such as increased reliability, foreseeing of costs and calculation of efficiency. However, by causing architects to change their accustomed ways of working, BIM also effects design approaches of architects and the nature of architecture. In this regard this paper aims to discover in which aspects BIM methods have impacts on architecture and alter the focus of architectural design especially in the designing processes at the architectural offices.

The implementation of BIM in projects or organization is in phases and building information models can be developed as 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D and 6D BIM depending on the stage of BIM implementation and level of details required. This study examined the levels of details of building information models being generated by two hundred and eighty two construction professionals in Lagos State, Nigeria using respondents driven sampling technique. Frequency distribution and percentage, clustered bar chart, mean ranking, Kruskal Wallis test and Fisher exact test were used to analyse the data obtained from the respondents. The study found that the implementation of BIM in the study area is for visualization purpose. The findings also revealed that the levels of generating 2D and 3D BIM were very high in the study area; and that 3D architectural model, 3D architectural and structural model, and 3D architectural and building services model were the most developed variants of 3D BIM. It was concluded that that the status of BIM adoption in construction industry in Lagos State, Nigeria is at the visualization phase.Keywords: BIM details, BIM, BIM development, 4D BIM, federated BIM.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2890078236"}}

It helps reduce the effort in cost estimation to survey the cost feedback on alternative schemes in the early stages of design. However, at these stages, the quantity could be absent or in excess because the BIM model has a low level of development (LOD). The building elements that have layered structures such as architectural walls always face such problems. This is because during the construction phase, each layer may have a different dimension. For instance, the height of the interior finish layer of the wall may be shorter than that of the core layer. On the other hand, the walls in a BIM model during the early stages usually have low LOD. Each wall layer is not created separately and some walls may overlap structural elements because the designers need a schematic BIM model that is easy to create and manipulate. This research proposes a method that will improve the accuracy of the wall quantity takeoff in the schematic BIM model by applying the concept of BIM-based clash detection. The proposed method automatically detects the overlapped areas and subtracts or adds the material quantity of each wall layer without the need for editing the BIM model. The now accurate quantities can then be used in the chosen project delivery method where a cost estimation feedback is needed during the early stages of the design process.

Today digital tools and systems are used in both design and production to produce, deliver and instruct actors throughout the phases of a project. However, the information usually exists in different islands and manual transfers are required to keep the flow of information between IT-systems and individuals continuous. A key to improving the ability for the members in different stages of a project to work with the same information is to facilitate different views. One of the building blocks for creating bridges between the islands of information is to introduce bills of materials which can be used to organize information for different purposes. Uniting the use of building information modeling (BIM) with bills of materials (BOM) is therefore our focus in this paper. This is done in the context of industrialized house-building and the facets which it brings to the subject. The aim of this paper is to present an early endeavor in to a BOM based approach for structuring information from BIM models. A demonstration tool was developed, and together with application in a case project from an industrialized house-builder, the generation of BOMs from BIM data is illustrated and discussed. The findings illustrates that we can apply different structures to the information located in our BIM models and that we can produce a BOM perspective on our products. Also, it is highlighted that we still need further studies to better understand how application of BOMs in the context of industrialized house-building is realized.

In housebuilding projects, there is an increased popularity of using virtual models for analyses of structural integrity and floor layout. However, these analyses are seldom coordinated since the models rarely are linked and the designers are not working close enough. As such, optimal designs are hard to find and time flies since even small changes turn into many iterations between design and structural analysis. General building information modeling and virtual design and construction methodologies suggest the use of interoperability and automation to bridge these gaps. There are examples of design tools that link different models using off -the -shelf tools or programming. However, most of the housebuilding companies seldom have these advanced tools or have the competence to do advanced programming. In this paper, we suggest an approach of using visual programming in a common BIM-software to explore the linking of different models. As an example, we study design of roof trusses since for many different roof shapes the same rules usually apply to the design of the truss. This project connects a BIM-software and a FEM -program with a master model. The model automatically generates a roof with the designed truss, draws the representation in a BIM-software and analyze it in a FEM -program. The early evaluations of this visual programming based approach are promising as there are possibilities to connect other domain models and create an even richer evaluation bases for early apartment housebuilding design.

Visualisation of the information flow in the industrialised house-building process is hard to track and information are often presented as islands, seldom described in the flow for the entire process. Interactive visualisation, using game technology, has open up for new applications of data -transformation, -visualization and -simulation of project information which is less studied in the context of industrialised house-building. This paper tries to address this issue via a combination of game engine technology and the predefined industrialised house-building process. The game engine technology allow development for end -user demands and functionality to express and visualise values for the daily planning and execution of processes. In a case study approach the development and analysis of four building projects were studied and chosen to the range of product platform predefinitions. Based on object structure for different views, models and the related metadata were visualised with an immersive virtual environment prototype. The prototype, based on game engine technology, was developed to manage incoming building projects variations that followed house-building platform predefinitions. As a visualising tool of engineering, on-site planning and production process the game engine technology simulates and visualize views on product structures, production information, assembling and operation instructions by interactive functions in the game environment.

During their lifecycles, buildings are changed and adapted to the requirements of generations of users, residents and proprietaries over several decades. At the end of their life time, buildings undergo either retrofit or deconstruction (and replacement) processes. And, modifications and deviations of the original building structure, equipment and fittings as well as the deterioration and contamination of buildings are often not well documented or only available in an outdated and unstructured way. Thus, in many existing buildings, incomplete, obsolete or fragmented building information is predominating and hampering retrofit and deconstruction project planning. To plan change or deconstruction measures in existing buildings, buildings are audited manually or with stationary laser scans which requires great effort of skilled staff and expensive equipment. Furthermore, current building information models or deconstruction planning systems are often not able to deal with incomplete building information as it occurs in existing buildings. We develop a combined system named ResourceApp of a hardware sensor with software modules for building information acquisition, 3D reconstruction, object detection, building inventory generation and optimized project planning. The mobile and wearable system enables planner, experts or decision makers to inspect a building and at the same time record, analyze, reconstruct and store the building digitally. For this purpose, a Kinect sensor acquires point clouds and developed algorithms analyze them in real-time to detect construction elements. From this information, a 3D building model and building inventory is automatically derived. Then, the generated building reconstruction information is used for optimized project planning with a solution algorithm of the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) at hand. In contrast to existing approaches, the system allows mobile building recording during building walkthrough, real-time reconstruction and object detection. And, based on the automatically captured and processed building conditions by sensor data, the system performs an integrated project planning of the building deconstruction with available resources and the required decontamination and deconstruction activities. Furthermore, it optimizes time and cost considering secondary raw material recovery, usage of renewable resources, staff qualification, onsite logistics, material storage and recycling options. Results from field tests on acquisition, reconstruction and deconstruction planning are presented and discussed in an extensive non-residential case study. The case study shows that the building inventory masses are quite well approximated and project planning works well based on the chosen methods. Nevertheless, future testing and parameter adjustment for the automated data processing is needed and will further improve the systems' quality, effectiveness and accuracy.

Various researches and studies about automated building code checking system have proved the result of benefit about usage of BIM model in building permission process. In most cases, the systems have used Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format for building permission process because IFC is international standard open BIM format. However, the IFC schema cannot be directly used to get the various building code information in most countries, moreover the usage and modeling guidelines of IFC schema to check building code are not existing yet. This issues cause interoperability problems during BIM modeling phase and the interoperability problems raise a reliability problem about the building permission.

Adoption of BIM (Building Information Modelling) technology in AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) industry and organisations in past few years has already outgrown to the phase of implementation especially in building and other more or less large-scale projects all around the world. With BIM project teams can use 3D digital models to collaborate, have consistent and more accurate project data regardless how many times the design changes, or who changes it among engineers, architects or building and infrastructure owners. These projects should be sustainable, faster completed and more economical. The boost for implementation in Europe has begun in 2014 after the European Parliament made a decision to modernize European public procurement rules by recommending the use of electronic tools like BIM. The European Union Public Procurement Directive (EUPPD) set a goal for all the European Member States which may encourage or mandate the use of BIM for publicly funded design contests and building projects by 2016. European countries like Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway and United Kingdom already require the use of BIM for publicly funded building projects.

Building information modelling technology provides a game-changing solution to address the challenges encountered in the AEC industry. However, this technology currently is not sufficient to fulfil the needs of construction practitioners in terms of proactive design and planning for boarding of light-frame residential buildings. This is partially due to the fact that boarding design and planning requires trades' know-how and substantial manual effort in developing the building information models. Current manual and ad hoc decision making for boarding of light-frame buildings leads to the generation of a significant amount of material waste. This research thus proposes a rule-based automated building information model (BIM) approach for designing boarding layout and planning material sheet cutting, resulting in practically feasible solutions with minimal material waste. In this research, object-based computer-processable layout design rules are comprehensively formalised based on trades' know-how. On this basis, rule-based design algorithms are further developed and integrated with mathematical algorithms in order to automatically generate design and planning alternatives while minimising material waste. Rich information in the BIM is leveraged to automate the rule-based boarding design and planning. A prototype system is developed based on Autodesk Revit via Application Programming Interface. A typical wood-framed residential building is used as a case study to test the developed prototype system. The results show the proposed approach successfully preserves the know-how of senior trades people while also minimising material waste in automating the boarding design and planning.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2792489274"}}

Over recent years there has been a drive to improve the image of the construction sector globally, especially in relation to building performance. This has resulted in the development of more intelligent and informed designs, thanks in part to the implementation, and in some cases mandating, of Building Information Modelling (BIM) working processes and the use of associated authoring and analysis software. As knowledge and understanding of BIM processes has advanced, the wider benefits afforded by such new technologies and approaches to building design and management are beginning to be realised. One such area is the regulatory process related to building design and construction. To date, a focus has been placed upon the possibilities afforded in relation to the automation of plan checking and to a lesser extent self-inspection. However, less focus has been placed on actual on-site third party verification during the construction phase, specifically relating to important building details. This is a critical, yet historically difficult area to assess, with the building regulatory process lacking sufficient rigour due the nature of periodic inspections. This current methodology means that critical details in terms of building performance are potentially not being constructed as per the approved or as-designed drawings. This paper will employ a scoping study to highlight historic issues and review current building regulatory and on-site assessment processes primarily in the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland, comparing these with similar processes in Asia. The aim is to identify potential issues with current practice internationally and to review advancements in BIM and related technological processes to determine if they can potentially assist in this area. The findings would suggest that there is a general issue in terms of validating the veracity of work which has taken place on site.

Building information modeling (BIM) is relatively slow in China in the early 21st century, and its practical application was only used in one stage of a project. Accordingly, the specific application of BIM in each stage was analyzed based on the advantages and values of BIM, and then the BIM framework was established in the whole life cycle of construction projects. According to the situation of BIM in China and the successful experience of BIM development in other countries, the problems of BIM application in China were identified, and corresponding measures were put forward to ensure better implementation of BIM in the whole life cycle. This study would provide reference for promoting the application of BIM in the whole life cycle of construction projects in China.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2895355947"}}

Design and drafting requirements associated with modular construction exceed those of the traditional stick-built method. Man-made errors, design assumptions and onsite interpretations of the shop drawings cannot be tolerated. Therefore, building information modelling (BIM) is needed to facilitate the automation of design and drafting for manufacturing. However, high initial cost, required expertise and limitations of currently available software prevent BIM from realizing its full potentials. This research introduces a systematic methodology for automating the drafting and design for manufacturing of wood-framed panels for modular residential buildings. It utilizes 2D computer-aided design (CAD) drawings to automatically generate BIM and construction manufacturing BIM; subsequently, shop drawings for the wood-framed panels are developed according to the platform framing method. The proposed framework is incorporated into a computer application called MCMPro, which is developed using visual basic application within CAD environment. Reduced design cost, improved layout accuracy and enhanced productivity are expected advances of MCMPro.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2789648104"}}

Information technology and its application have resulted in enormous development in the construction industry during the last decade. The main reason behind this evolution was the incorporation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) to be an inefficient construction approach. BIM is now globally considered to be the tool of transforming the construction process to new era. It is also considered as a good tool for the whole project lifecycle. The aim of the present study is to clarify how BIM can be used in after project construction within uncertainty and risky environment such as document losses and unrecorded change orders. Interviews with project team, project site photography, collecting the available schemes and documents were the approaches used in this work to re-build the projects models. The results obtained from this work show that the knowledge and expectations of BIM within existing building have an admirable achievements for construction industry. Furthermore, BIM approach used in this work made more progress in the implementation of BIM as a rehabilitation and renovation tool in civil projects. The conclusions from this study reflect high correlation between the quantities take off with what as-built constructed, more than the traditional approach. The glamorous lessons derived from BIM implementation for the case study is; working with a model in which all project team feel comfortable and harmonic, will ensure enough resources to make the model updated and ought to lead to a minimum conflict within the model or what traditionally called \u201cproject documents\u201d.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2781619266"}}

Building Information Modeling is based on the idea of the continuous use of digital building models throughout the entire lifecycle of a built facility, starting from the early conceptual design and detailed design phases, to the construction phase, and the long phase of operation. BIM significantly improves information flow between stakeholders involved at all stages, resulting in an increase in efficiency by reducing the laborious and error-prone manual re-entering of information that dominates conventional paper-based workflows. Thanks to its many advantages, BIM is already practiced in many construction projects throughout the entire world. However, the fragmented nature of the construction industry still impedes its more widespread use. Government initiatives around the world play an important role in increasing BIM adoption: as the largest client of the construction industry in many countries, the state has the power to significantly change its work practices.

This chapter describes how the effective tool for scheduling and controlling costs, calculating time periods and managing the technological enhancement of a construction project is project risk assessment. Projects under construction usually encounter a lot of uncertainties at different stages of work, which leads to increase of risk in terms of the expected cost of construction, delays in handing over and a poor quality of the project. The Indian built environment sector is ruined by delays and cost overruns as projects are not completed within time and within quality guidelines. Due to the increasing complexity of the design, operation, construction maintenance of modern built environmental assets, traditional construction has become an outdated paradigm.

The Building Information Modelling (BIM) has come forth as a key stream in civil engineering and project management and has received ample attention from researchers in the last decade. BIM can be considered as an evolution of CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and its implementation will contribute to increase construction sector efficiency. To study the unrealised advantages of implementation of BIM, a Level-2, Level of Development (LOD)-300, & 5-Dimensional model of a residential project were developed and compared with conventional process. The model was developed by following a systematize methodology and various tools & software\u2019s like Autodesk Revit, Autodesk Naviswork and Microsoft project have been used. The aspects like real-time cost planning & conceptual Modelling were studied. It was noted that by adopting the multi-dimensional BIM model the rework is reduced with the help of clash detection, the productivity was improved due to reduction of conflicts and changes during construction. The findings of this study suggest that by adopting the 5-D BIM can boost the growth of construction industry. Further, by integrating Internet on Things (IOT), Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) with BIM will provide a new direction to BIM technology in future.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3119515262"}}

Traditionally, the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry relies heavily on the use of paper-based communication. This is a major source of errors resulting in extra costs, delay, friction and even lawsuits in the construction process, since AEC projects typically involve complex communication-intensive processes across multiple organizations. In the past years, Building information modelling (BIM) has been hailed as the solution to help with many of these problems. BIM is one of the most promising recent developments in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Using this technology it is possible to digitally construct a virtual model of a building. BIM has proven to provide various benefits, but also faces some barriers during its adoption. The biggest barriers we\u2019ve found were the high knowledge requirements, and thus training costs, and difficulties integrating different BIM platforms. This leads to a proposed reference architecture and data platform to help overcome these barriers of Building Information Modeling (BIM) adoption by the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry and to support digital transformation and transition to smart industry. The reference architecture focusses on keeping the traditional application landscape intact (therefore reducing training costs) and simplifying BIM integrations by adhering to the industry wide standard for BIM models: the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The architecture is prototyped using eMagiz Integration Platform as a Service (IPaaS), BIMServer and Mendix. We provide science and practice alike with an example of a functioning, process-wide BIM integration. By reducing the two biggest barriers identified in literature, namely Required Training and Knowledge (by allowing users to work without BIM without having to learn everything about it) and Software and Integration issues (by creating an open integration based on existing standards and simplifying the integration tasks), the reference architecture will hopefully increase BIM adoption.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2894246195"}}

The costs of social housing retrofit are critical for social housing companies, for efforts to build sustainable cities, and for society. Compared to available resources, retrofits are deemed costly, and there is a need to improve productivity. One approach is to realise digital integration and (partial) automation processes, creating more performative digital practices. However what digitalisation should target and its scope is difficult to decide. Even standard concepts like Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) have many variants. To capture the performance gain of digitalisation requires measurement methods, while most methods are designed for new built and production, and does not appreciate the costs and values that characterize retrofit using digital practices. This paper aims at conceptualizing a method for understanding performance in digitalized retrofit of social housing. A review of approaches to productivity, efficiency and performance is done. Values produced are multidimensional and cannot be reduced to costs per m2. Performance is proposed conceptualized as values produced for clients, tenants and companies, and then compared to costs and effects of the digital practices. The context is two phases of a large Scandinavian retrofit project, followed by a longitudinal study using a mixed method approach. The social housing consists of 900 apartments in blocks and in row houses at 70.000 m2. The refurbishment encompasses new bath rooms, ventilation and parts of the building envelope. A gradual VDC implementation is carried out, avoiding an ambitious overall implementation. The performance is dependent of hybrid ICT and organizational practices, where the interaction with tenants is important. It is therefore a hybrid set of factors that lever performance, including intense coordination among contractors, continual communication, interaction with tenants and the craftsmen's learning during production.

With its generally recognized benefits of clean and safe working environment and good quality, prefabricated house construction (PHC) as a solution is gaining momentum in the face of various housing challenges in Hong Kong's construction industry. Although prefabrication has its own benefits, its fundamental disadvantages of fragmentation, discontinuity, poor interoperability, and scarce real-time information availability have imposed significant adverse influence on the schedule performance of prefabricated house construction. As a result, despite the promise of the government to provide sufficient houses and harmonious housing, schedule delay problems still frequently beset the industry of PHC. To help address schedule delay problems encountered in the construction of prefabrication housing, this research first identified and analysed critical schedule risk factors that may have significant influence on the schedule performance of PHC. Based on the identified schedule risks, the challenges and corresponding required functions for enhancing schedule performance are determined. Then, a radio frequency identification device (RFID)-enabled BIM platform that integrates various involved stakeholders, information/data flow, offshore prefabrication procedures, and state-of-the-art construction technologies, is developed to handle the critical schedule factors. Smart construction objects and RFID-enabled smart gateway work collaboratively to ease operations within the three echelons of prefabrication manufacturing, logistics and on-site assembly construction, while real-time captured data are used to form a closed-loop visibility and traceability mode in which different end users can supervise the construction statuses, progresses in real time. The developed platform can provide various services, tools and mechanisms to different stakeholders, improve the success of daily operations and decision makings throughout PHC management, such that critical schedule risks can be mitigated and the schedule performance of PHC can be enhanced to ensure timely project delivery.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2737493980"}}

In this paper, differences in the data structure of these two types of construction-related tools are discussed and compared with the current MVD standards.

Bridge information modelling (BrIM) invokes stakeholder collaboration, supported by policy and process frameworks, combined with interoperable technology, to manage information and enable effective decision making throughout the lifecycle of a bridge asset. This paper considers the application of BrIM for the proposed rehabilitation of a heritage listed viaduct. The structure under consideration is the landmark Chetwynd viaduct in Cork (Ireland), which formed part of the Cork\u2013Bandon railway infrastructure constructed in 1851 and decommissioned in 1961. As with infrastructure of its type, few as-built records exist. Consequently, the geometry, material properties and condition of the existing structure are required to inform the initial feasibility assessment and subsequent design, construction and operation of this viaduct asset. Respective BrIM and traditional approaches to the data capture phase are outlined and compared in terms of time, expertise and deliverables. The significant deliverables from the traditional approach include a three-dimensional (3D) solid model and independent 2D drawings. Significant deliverables achieved using a BrIM approach include an intelligent parametric 3D model and associated 2D drawings, as well as integrated datasets representative of the \u2018as-is\u2019 structure.

During the past decade, building information modeling (BIM) has significantly influenced the construction industry. However, none of the available BIM tools and frameworks focuses on modular construction as an industrialized type of construction; thereby, implementation of BIM in these projects is relatively more challenging compared to site-built constructions. In this paper, an information delivery framework is presented for multistory modular buildings that can address both the project-based and product-based nature of these buildings. To develop such a framework, an extension to an already-existing information delivery manual development methodology is proposed in this paper. The extension makes it possible to capture the hierarchy of the building components, which is an important characteristic of modular buildings as manufactured products. This is done by integrating a new component known as a product architecture model (PAM) with other components of the framework in order to capture the information related to industrialized product-based nature of these buildings. This paper reports the extended methodology and frameworks developed using this methodology for multistory modular buildings. The resulting framework is validated by considering a typical modular building project in the United States and comparing its information flow with the framework.

Building information modeling (BIM) serves as a shared knowledge resource for information about a facility, forming a reliable basis for decisions during its life cycle from inception onward. BIM technology has been utilized increasingly in quantitative ways in the architecture, engineering, and construction disciplines. However, owing to increasing requirements for an improvement in qualitative factors in BIM-based design projects, it has become necessary to develop a checking and evaluation process for improvement of BIM-based design quality. The delivery of the BIM data is mandatory in advanced countries, and these countries are promoting the automated checking for BIM quality, including compliance with the building code. For example, Singapore has developed a BIM-based automated regulation checking process through the software FORNAX and has built a construction administration system, CORENET. The SMARTcodes project in the USA has structuralized the regulations of the International Code Council (ICC) and developed automatic code compliance checking systems. In particular, code checks through and automated code checking system can reduce errors, time, and the inefficient use of human resources through objective verification. The purpose of this study is to suggest methodology of building code checking system for design quality checking based on BIM. In this study, the scope of applied design quality checking is confined to building codes. The methodology of this study to achieve this purpose is as follows. (1) The authors have suggested an open BIM-based design quality checking process. The architects create open BIM data using guideline and BIM library that was developed this study. The BIM data is checked through building code checking system called KBim Assess-Lite. (2) The authors developed a logic rule-based management system called KBim Logic. This system translates Korea building code (natural language) into computer-executable rule set files. Following the logic-rule based mechanism, the building code sentences are converted into intermediate script language called KBim Code. (3) The authors developed a building code checking system called KBim Assess-Lite. This system can assess quality of the IFC-based open BIM data. Major aspect of the BIM model quality is conformance of the building code (KBim code). According to this process, prevent various problem which may occur in developing the automated design quality checking system. Consequently, the architects can achieve the set up goals much easier and faster through the developed automated design quality checking system.

With the rise of Building Information Modeling (BIM), off-site construction is gaining momentum in the construction industry. This construction method can benefit the industry through improved productivity and reduced waste. However, it also poses new challenges to building designers and construction practitioners with respect to building design and construction planning. For example, when designing building products and BIM models, designers needs to consider manufacturing process constraints in order to harness the benefits of manufacturing technology. This is in part due to the fact that, in the offsite construction paradigm, building design must be transformed from product-focused to manufacturing process-driven. At present, considerable human involvement and off-site construction knowledge are required to adapt building design (e.g., panelize building objects) for manufacturing processes within BIM environments. In this regard, this research contributes a BIM-based algorithm for panelizing building components. The proposed algorithm is capable of determining the granularity of wall panels and optimizing the configuration of multi-wall panels under engineering constraints, thereby improving productivity.

Modular buildings are assembled from components that are prefabricated in manufacturing plants and transported to the construction site for assembly. The current manual-based approach to modular construction, which typically applies the traditional stick-building-under-a-roof method, is time-consuming and labour-intensive. However, the application of automated prefabrication of components has the potential to significantly advance the productivity, worker safety, and competitiveness of the Canadian construction industry. This research, focusing on the construction of wood-framed panels, presents a methodology which allows intelligent wall panels with different design properties to be analyzed. By integrating external databases with building information modelling (BIM)-based software and generating wall panel combination plans and assembly information, intelligent wall panel prefabrication is achieved. The study of panel prefabrication for a sample house from an Edmonton-based panel manufacturer is presented in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

By analyzing the data, they can make decisions in terms of whether to and/or where to invest money for maintaining better conditions of the buildings. Conventionally, the facility personnel collect O&M data in a manual manner and organize them in a paper document format. In this format, most of O&M data are intertwined and mingled up so that both FM personnel and building owner fail to capture significant information for reliable O&M performance. More often than not the building owners have difficulty in understanding the building\u0092s O&M performance through the bundled data. According to the FM personnel\u0092s work process and building owner\u0092s decision making process, location data are employed as a starting point to O&M work and O&M performance confirmation respectively. Despite of the significant role of location data, no systematic framework based on the location data has been developed. For the purpose of facilitating both the owner and facility manager's better decision making, the authors develop a system framework for 3D/BIM-based facility information management. The 3D/BIM has an advantage on storing and outputting the location data. Using the system framework, the FM personnel and building owner obtain effective information management platform based on location data. In addition, the research can contribute to the foundation for a development of a BIM-driven facility management system.

However, at the construction stage, the MEP professional still strives to install the MEP system only according to the BIM model due to insufficient information. This is because the BIM model of the MEP system is not well developed from the information requirements of the construction professional. Furthermore, it may also take too much effort to develop an information- sufficient BIM model because of the complexity involved. Therefore, there is a need of taking the more effective and efficient approach that can quickly develop the MEP BIM model from the construction perspective. This proposed study takes the fire-fighting system as the example to smooth the processes of developing the constructive MEP BIM model. First, a review of the construction specification and an interview with fire-fighting construction professionals are conducted to identify the information requirements. Then an ontology that employs the above result to determine the rules of building the information-sufficient BIM model is developed. Furthermore, a series of Dynamo modules are established to smooth the process of developing the BIM model for the fire-fighting system.

The efficiency of Building Information Model (BIM) design in construction sites has been proven through many projects. The full overview and control of design, construction and life-cycle of a structure brings sustainability to buildings and provides optimized purpose for their use. Residential and non-residential buildings, bridges and other civil and structural engineering products will adopt BIM next to benefit from advanced control of infrastructure and related services. Road design is a complex process requiring collaboration in planning, designing, constructing and execution of designs. The design must consider soil investigations, infrastructure planning, various ecologic aspects and the construction designs to achieve the set durability and efficiency goals. This includes the economic implications and planned maintenance during the entire life-cycle of the construction. The impacts of these features could be improved by detailed analysis and monitoring of the physical behavior of the structure during construction and operative use. The physical performance of the structure may be efficiently analyzed by using numerical modelling, such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Integration of FEA in the BIM of road design may significantly improve the road construction and its features during the entire life-cycle. The presented paper discusses the possibilities to improve the road designs via applying FEA tools in information model data exchange. The actual on-site monitoring and analysis would improve the quality of the road building and support its efficient and timely maintenance. Active and detailed collaboration of architects, engineers, constructors and facility managers could yield to efficient and sustainable designs and significantly improve the quality of current and future plans.

Catalog of Work of Graduate Students FGPA from BIM. Building Information Modeling (BIM), as a modern approach in a built environment, combines the fields of construction, architecture, mechanical engineering and other fields related to construction projects using information and communication technologies. BIM's approach is an information model of a building, which with all the collected information represents an increase in quality, accuracy and accessibility to information throughout the life cycle of construction projects. With BIMpristop, processes (process model) and individual blocks of the building object (object model) in building projects in all stages of the process are improved. Such an approach comprehensively addresses construction projects from their conceptual design, geometric representation of the building, functional purpose, structural and energy analysis, placement into space, until their realization, and later when used and ultimately in decomposition. The responsibility of the Faculty of Civil Engineering, Traffic Engineering and Architecture of the University of Maribor (FGPA UM), whose primary activity is the education and training of future personnel, is constantly increasing in the ongoing research and development of new modern forms of knowledge acquisition. Therefore, the content of study programs is constantly adapting to new trends in the construction industry. The enthusiasm and interest of students is greatly contributed to this by the enthusiasm and interest of students who, together with their mentors and co-mentors in their final work, give new, often unexplored, fields of construction projects with a modern BIM approach. The present e-publication titled FGPA Final Results Catalog in the field of BIM provides summaries of the graduate, master's and doctoral students who are or will be shortly finishing their studies at FGPA and whose final work deals with the BIM approach. The purpose of the e-publication is the promotion of students, and consequently also FGPA, and can be at the same time a source of information for companies with the vision of introducing BIMpristop, in finding the qualified cadres they need to achieve the set development goals.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2655987495"}}

A total of 831 daily work orders from five construction projects were collected and analyzed for the potential of linking the daily work orders with product elements in building information modeling (BIM). The purpose of the analysis was to see whether a BIM-based bill of materials (BOM) for each daily work order can be generated through the links. The analysis was done with the level of development (LOD) defined by the American Institute of Architects (AIA), and it shows that, when LOD 300 is used, only 29% of the daily work orders have corresponding elements in BIM, whereas when LOD 400 is used, 98% of the daily work orders have corresponding elements in BIM. When the scope of the analysis is limited to those daily work orders associated with made-to-stock (MTS) type of materials, the percentage is 1.3% when LOD 300 is used and 99.6% when LOD 400 is used. This shows that the MTS (non-prefabricated) materials would benefit from using LOD 400 more than other types of materials that are prefabricated to a certain extent. The authors also found that whereas prior studies address the topic of generating a BOM for prefabricated materials, studies on generating a daily BOM for the MTS type of materials are difficult to find. For researchers who wish to work on the topic of BIM-based daily work orders and its constituent, a BIM-based BOM, the analysis of the 831 daily work orders shows that the use of LOD 400 is critical, especially for daily work orders and BOMs related to the MTS type of materials.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2542932037"}}

This paper studies the role of building information standards for classification in digitization of the building life cycle. It draws on science and technology studies of information technology standards, big data and building information modelling (BIM) in building research. The approach is based on performativity of standards for information systems, viewing performativity as potentially non-linear and multiple. The five-year design process of a large hospital in Denmark is examined as episodes of performance of the building information standard, particularly one recent standard, the Cuneco Classification System (CCS). The study shows that despite client demands, several building information standards are active over time: an \u2018expansive\u2019 design brief process adds user demands and uses room classification. Another process diminishes the design brief more than 50%, with several standards in use.

This paper explores some of the key challenges and risks faced by structural engineers when working with existing building structures as well as identifies potential cost- and schedule-saving approaches that can streamline the design process and maintain the integrity of the anticipated scope and project quality. Often times, structural engineers enter into the design phase with incomplete existing documentation and limited access to carry out the full-scale site investigations needed to observe and record the existing structural conditions. Utilizing a case study of the recently completed $54 million Logan International Airport Terminal C to E (C2E) Connector project, this paper explores various approaches that structural engineers can use during the design phase to expedite the building systems coordination through the use of building information modeling (BIM) tools, laser scanning, and selective localized demolition. These approaches can help minimize unforeseen conditions when the construction begins, thus ultimately helping to mitigate costly change orders and schedule delays that would be required to accommodate these unknown conditions. Successful completion of the C2E project required in-depth understanding of the original construction, subsequent renovations of both terminals (C and E), coordination between adjacent concurrent construction projects, and collaborative construction sequencing to ensure minimal disruptions to airport operations, while maintaining containment of post-security areas. Additionally, early engagement and integrated project team collaboration with the Contractor can serve to identify critical enabling packages and project milestones. This facilitates efficient and timely completion of the structural design and the complex phasing required to satisfy operation of a fully active project site open to the public and coordination with overlapping scope of adjacent projects. Throughout this paper, a number of project-specific items are explored to further support the impact of the above-described design approaches and efforts as a way to minimize the challenges and risks faced by structural engineers when working with existing building structures.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2604945391"}}

In today's world, execution of architectural projects depends on participants' ways of finding solutions to problems that might occur and how fast they can solve those problems in addition to completion of designs as scheduled. In projects where different participants work together, the main purpose of the participants is to finalize the project in time with the resources and budget planned. Nevertheless, complex and variable structures of construction projects bring divergencies along. In the past, computers were used only to find solutions to general problems whereas today, they can perform different and complex functions and are able to provide different data. Thanks to computers, new habitudes are gained in the fields of communication, data management and design. Thus, it has become easier to reach information and data production has accelarated. Thanks to innovations and developments in the information technologies, building sector has also developed. In the 20th century, different design models have been devised due to the varieties of usage in intended purposes of constructions. Projects with original designs and construction process have emerged while design models have been being implemented Information Systems (BIM) ensure coordination and communication between different disciplines. The increase in using building information systems at different stages of architectural projects resulted in emergence of more developed BIM models. BIS can meet the need of being in cohesion in issues like design, project, planning, marketing, resource management, information sharing and administration. Together with the developing technology, there is a transition from traditional hand-drawn design to computer-aided design (CAD). The main structure of CAD relies on the basis of Interactive Computer Graphics (ICG) systems. Today, a new design system called Information Modeling has been developed in order to overcome the malfunctions in complex projects drawn by CAD system. System Information Modelling is also known as Information Modelling and usually used with its abbreviation BIM (throughout the thesis BIM, its abbreviation will be used). In fact, Building Information Modelling and Management might be a better description for it as there is also management part in the system. BIM provides model analysis where products are created three dimensional rather than two. It is a system which enables sharing of information and supports cooperation between project participants. It is described as an information source that subsists all through out a project (during stages of planning, design, construction and demolition). Thanks to the cooperation it provides when it is used effectively, returning profit in terms of time and cost and decreasing error rate. BIM is developed in order to carry out those demands and requisites with the help of technology.

In this sense, the development of BIM processes for punctual building has now reached a level of maturity able to satisfy also the recent guidelines of the European Standards (2014/24 / EU) adopted to promote, first of all, the transparency of public work contracts and design contests. However, as regards linear construction, the full application of these BIM processes with an adequate level of maturity still remains rather complex considering that the current processes representation in use has achieved an adequate level of development. In this case study, applications have been developed in BIM mode with the aim of highlighting the main potential of this innovative process including some improvements in order to promote the full implementation of the BIM technology for rail infrastructure.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2598399098"}}

Many companies and organizations highlighted the importance of developing various security monitoring systems for the purpose of protecting their assets against any undesirable events. The process of installing surveillance cameras inside buildings is complex and costly. One of the most important issues that can affect the cost of surveillance cameras in buildings is finding the best placement of cameras. Individuals who are responsible for the camera installation are facing great challenges due to the large number of variables related to this problem. Finding effective scientific methods to address this problem can lead to increasing the efficiency of the camera placement through maximizing the coverage and minimizing the cost. Furthermore, available methods did not take into consideration the impact of different elements (e.g. the HVAC system) that can affect the camera placement.  Building Information Modeling (BIM) is becoming an indispensable process for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. In terms of security management, BIM technology can improve the performance of security systems during the design phase because of its ability to identify various elements that surround the 3D surveillance cameras in the form of geometrical and non-geometrical entities. iv   The objectives of this research are: (1) to develop a method that can help in calculating the coverage of surveillance cameras inside buildings; (2) to investigate the impact of the building elements on the camera configurations, parameters and coverage using BIM; (3) to develop a method that can find the near-optimum types, number and placement of fixed cameras inside a building; and (4) to develop a method that can find the near-optimum placement and movement plan of a Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera inside a building.  A method is developed to calculate the camera coverage inside buildings using BIM and a game engine for the purpose of automating the calculation process and achieving accurate results. This method includes a sensitivity analysis for evaluating the suitable cell size in order to cover the monitored area. Also, the research proposes a novel method using BIM, which provides a new opportunity to better optimize the number and locations of cameras by exploiting the rich information available in the model. The near-optimum results aim to maximize the cameras\u2019 coverages and to minimize their costs. BIM is used to define the input of the optimization process and to visualize the results. The method uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the optimization problem. Finally, the research addresses the placement problem for a PTZ camera. PTZ cameras are used as an addition to fixed cameras in order to ensure the detection of dynamic activities. The research extends the previous method to optimize the placement and movement plan of a PTZ camera inside a building. Several case studies are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methods. The proposed methods can help individuals who are responsible of the camera installation to efficiently determine", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2674846277"}}

Integration between Design and Construction is a common topic discussed in the literature in construction. The impacts of construction industry fragmentation are quite well known: poor design quality, lack of standards and constructability, suboptimal design solutions, high number of change orders, high rate of rework in design and construction, low value delivered for clients, design and construction delays and higher project costs. In the case of construction projects in which the design stage overlaps the construction stage, the industry fragmentation increases the projects\u2019 risks and in some cases it nullifies the gains in cost and time which come about when using the strategy of overlapping. Although researchers tried to address the problem of industry fragmentation by implementing new tools and methods to integrate project stakeholders, for example, using Building Information Modelling (BIM), Integrated Concurrent Engineering, Big-Room, and so on, the literature is still lacking in concepts and theories about how to integrate planning and controlling of both Design and Construction stages. The purpose of this paper is to present the use of some concepts, such as production batch and work package, in order to create a common ground among Design, Construction and Costs simulations using BIM and line of balance. The case study is a retrofit of a set of social housing in Antrim (Northern Ireland) which aims to improve the energy efficiency of solid wall houses, at the sametime as reducing the disruption for end users. The study is part of the research project entitled S-IMPLER (Solid Wall Innovative Insulation and Monitoring Processes using Lean Energy Efficient Retrofit) funded by the Innovate UK, which aims to develop a retrofit solution for social housing built with solid walls to achieve 60% reduction in monitored energy costs, with less disruption for end users, keeping quality and safety at high levels. The use of these concepts allowed the creation of different scenarios for design solutions and production system organization which were presented in a What-if Matrix. The costs changed as a consequence of the crossing scenarios. Adding to it, the definition of production batch and work package was essential to develop the BIM models (3D, 4D and 5D), as well as the line of balance used to plan the retrofit works and measure the end users disruption. The research findings show that the common definition of production batch and work packages between Design and Construction stages used in the retrofit study worked as a boundary object in the development of BIM models and scenarios simulations. These concepts created the basis for the integration between design and construction, especially, in projects using BIM. The results are not limited to the context of retrofit and further research is currently undertaken by the researchers to examine its validity and applicability in different settings.

Visualization features in BIM are utilized by students to help them identifying potential hazard, unsafe acts, and unsafe conditions in a simulated construction project. The result shows that students are more aware and capable to identify any potential hazard and related safety regulations of construction plan and design pertinent to specific site conditions than that if they were only equipped with a set of construction drawings and specifications.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2781501722"}}

In building construction, construction planning varies largely depending on its architectural design and site conditions, as well as the supply conditions of building materials/components and labor during the construction period. In general, as building constru ction is carried out only once under the same conditions, it becomes significantly necessary to simulate the construction progress by using simulation technology, in order to clarify problems and to improve issues prior to the actual construction. This paper proposed methodologies to represent construction works in models with high flexibility, and also to calculate construction progresses, then verified that the simulation was carried out accurately in the case study on reinforced concrete works using these methodologies.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2729065188"}}

Beyond its widespread use for representing technical aspects and matters of building and construction science, Building information modeling (BIM) can be used to represent architectural relationships and rules drawn from aesthetic theory. This research suggests that BIM provides not only vocabulary but also syntactical tools that can be used to capture an architectural language. In a case study using Richard Meier\u00c2\u0092s language for single-family detached houses, a BIM template has been devised to represent the aesthetic concepts and relations therein. The template employs parameterized conceptual mass objects, syntactical rules, and a library of architectonic elements, such as walls, roofs, columns, windows, doors, and railings. It constrains any design produced using the template to a grammatically consistent expression or style. The template has been used as the starting point for modeling the Smith House, the Douglas House, and others created by the authors, demonstrating that the aesthetic template is general to many variations. Designing with the template to produce a unique but conforming design further illustrates the generality and expressiveness of the language. Having made the formal language explicit, in terms of syntactical rules and vocabulary, it becomes easier to vary the formal grammar and concrete vocabulary to produce variant languages and styles. Accordingly, this approach is not limited to a specific style, such as Richard Meier's. Future research can be conducted to demonstrate how designing with BIM can support stylistic change. Adoption of this approach in practice could improve the consistency of architectural designs and their coherence to defined styles, potentially increasing the general level of aesthetic expression in our built environment.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2804952688"}}

The concept of entropy, which can be used to measure physical disorder, has been rediscovered by Shannon to measure the irregularity in information. Entropy measurements are made by considering one or more factors. Specific features such as color, shape, element type, height, material related with architectural compositions can be considered as factors and the amount of information carried by the building depending on one or more of these factors can be measured. In this study, it is questioned whether there is a relationship between entropy values of municipal building competition projects, which are measured in relation to the factors, and the building is considered successful by the competition jury. In order to conduct this examination, the entropy values of the projects, which respected to the same architectural program and won various awards in the project competitions were calculated. Before making comparisons, measurements were made according to solid-void ratios on the plan layout, the shapes of closed and discrete spaces, and the distribution of functions.

Contemporary Building Information Modeling (BIM) software provides basic component types such as bathtubs, desks, windows and walls that are available in many varieties of kinds and ready for drag-and-drop into a design project. However, the software is unlikely to provide higher level constructs such as bathrooms or offices as types, and these spatial concepts are largely unframed in the ontology of the building system. This paper looks at these spatial concepts left unframed in BIM as important fabric in the design process, examines how they are represented typologically in conventional design resources such as Neufert Architects' Data, and discusses strategies for embedding them in BIM. Together with abundant published cases of architectural designs, the examples of spatial forms in these resources play a role of Big Data. The paper then demonstrates a prototype of parametric office building typology embedded in BIM and illustrates how such a tool helps an architect to study volumetric layout on a given site.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in the life cycle management field of buildings through the introduction of BIM. And as BIM application is expanded, BIM ordering guidelines and guidelines are becoming popular. Also, as diverse forms of buildings including super high-rise building have been generalized, attention to the importance of curtain walls that are advantageous for construction period shortening, building lighting and quality homogenization has been increasing. However, all BIM information from the design stage to the maintenance stage is not accumulated in stages. And the input information is not improved in proportion to the level of appearance of the BIM model. Also, current curtain wall designs rely heavily on curtain wall consulting firms or utilize accumulated data from existing processes. In this study, curtain wall components, shape and property information were derived by analyzing BIM guidelines and curtain wall construction standards to contribute to solving these problems. And the curtain wall smart BIM library which can be converted according to LOD(Level of Development) has been produced and its applicability has been verified. Through the library, curtain wall information can be systematically managed in the library from design to construction and maintenance. And the library will contribute to the expansion and activation of the BIM library market in the future.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2786107024"}}

According to the philosophy of Lean Construction the concept of construction is taken by models of flows, which are manifested in flows of objects, people and information. The present research focuses on the flow of information. There is little literature on the implementation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the works in Lima, and the study of the stage of finishing in buildings. This research is a contribution to the implementation of ICT in the works, this particular case in the stage of finishing of buildings, where there is communication problems between those involved, ie a low flow of information. We propose a communication scheme based on our reality supported by a communication platform that provides ICT in order to optimize the flow of information. This communication platform allows a collaborative communication, so that the information sent is complete, efficient and understandable, a message communication structure is developed under the methodology Design Thinking. The project is a building of 5 floors and 3 basements, which is in the finishing stage. The magnitude of the work is medium. The planning of the environments is done based on the progress of work and the work involved. For this purpose, the balance sheet method was used to monitor the development of the work. It also analyzes if there is any relationship between the information flows and work progress. The implementation has a low cost, which is within reach of any construction project. This implementation was made through a series of steps based on the choice of the application, the creation of the communication structure of the message, the training, the creation of the platform, the monitoring, the survey on the perception of users and The reinforcement in the implementation. The ICT that was implemented is an application called WhatsApp supported by mobile technology, which has been chosen by criteria according to our reality. The communication structure is effective since it manages to send more complete information, the average information flow was 5.35 messages / day. It was also found that the number of relevant messages was 76% and the most types of messages sent were text with 72%, finally the reports and queries are the most important according to what. With all this, it is possible to change the communication scheme, giving rise to a collaborative communication.

However, compared to other fields in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, there have been less research and projects on BIM in the field of interior architecture. For increasing the feasibility of adapting BIM in interior architecture design, this paper describes a case study-projecting images for designing interior panels using parametric modeling. This process needs elaborate, delicate, and precise steps for harmonious output. For continuous use of building, users look forward to the design which variable and changeable according to user's preference and environment. Therefore, demand for parametric design in the interior design part such as panel pattern design for various decoration is growing. Treated process in this paper deals with an advanced phase which much effective in decreasing time consumption and useless part of process. Finally, this paper suggests the possibility of using BIM in the interior design process and field where BIM can be applied.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2604699570"}}

Research on digitizing the various aspects of a typical building project has been on the increase since the advent of Building Information Modelling (BIM). Most efforts build on information technology capabilities already achieved in the various professional domains associated with different stages of the building life cycle. It is predicted that BIM will help to drastically reduce errors, fast-track project delivery time and save implementation costs. As such BIM is now being utilized in the various professional domains and project stages. However, research suggests that the building operation and management stage is being left behind despite the abundance of data collected using building management systems (BMS) of varying degrees of sophistication. It is therefore important to consider exploring BIM applications that encompasses the building operation phase. This will enhance the evaluation of building performance in use and provide feedback to the design stage which could help eliminate design-related performance issues. A framework for utilizing feedback loops from building energy consumption to inform and improve design and facility management in a BIM environment is therefore proposed. A prototype illustrating the framework is implemented in. NET framework interfaced with a BIM-enabled tool and tested in the refinement of a pre-designed school using data from the operations phase of another school delivered previously.

Current statistics on Health and Safety (H&S) outcomes the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) public construction sector demonstrate the need for academic and practical assessment of the current environment for the purpose of improving outcomes. Even though the construction public sector in Saudi Arabia has been rapidly expanding, the H&S record of this industry remains considerably poor, as evidenced by the rising figures of injuries and deaths. The purpose of this research is to assess the current use of H&S technologies and, therefore, possibilities for the use of building information modelling (BIM) in the industry. The research aims to enhance H&S management in Saudi public sector construction projects by exploring integrated approaches to project design and delivery using BIM-based technologies and processes  This research uses a mixed method approach to assess the current H&S environment to develop a framework suitable for the unique environment aimed at improving the current outcomes. The data collected through a survey and interviews with subject matter experts has been analysed to outline the major issues facing the implementation of innovative technologies to improve current business processes and provide a roadmap to enhance the predominant H&S policies and activities in Saudi Arabia. Challenges identified through these efforts include the Saudi environment as having high levels of fragmentation, a low skilled, multilingual and multi-ethnic workforce and inefficient use of BIM technologies being made.  Based on these findings, a framework, which incorporates BIM to include automated hazard identification and correction during design and during construction, has been developed. The framework is initially devised based on a synthesis of the literature and further refined based on findings from questionnaires. The result of this research is the identification of 18 factors impacting H&S. The framework is developed and validated using interpretive structural modelling (ISM). Through these methods, the key driving factors for improving H&S outcomes in the public construction sector in KSA are identified. Among these, better enforcement of regulations and laws is identified as the key factor needed for improving outcomes. The study concludes with a discussion of the applications of the proposed framework and recommendations for future research. Specifically, this research advocates for the inclusion of BIM technologies in H&S frameworks as a method of addressing the specific challenge of communicating with a predominately migrant workforce. This new approach for H&S analysis during construction focuses on the integration of construction simulation, 3D/4D/5D construction management and safety analysis through the incorporation of technology for both planning and communication.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2605435580"}}

This study reviewed the status of domestic and foreign Architectural Information Systems and related laws, analyzed the state of the architectural service industry, and proposed the phased introduction of BIM into Architectural Information Systems. The adoption of BIM in Architectural Information Systems both at home and abroad is generally at an unsatisfactory level, with only Singapore assuming a leading role in this area through activities such as the provision of a separate BIM submission service. Since it is desirable for BIM to be applied to additional types of architecture when the architectural licensing procedure is introduced, the different phases of adoption were set after analyzing the scales and types of architecture as defined in related laws. By analyzing the participation rates of architectural design firms in each scale of architecture design, the results demonstrated that, as the number of floors and total floor area in the building increases, the proportion of small scale architectural design firms involved decreases, while that of large-scale architectural design firms increases. The adoption of BIM is occurring mostly within large-scale architectural design firms, which is why it is desirable for its introduction into Architectural Information Systems to be separated into phases from large-scale buildings to increasingly small-scale architecture. In conclusion, this study divided the adoption of BIM in Architectural Information Systems into 6 stages and, following the Architectural administration procedure, established a segmented road map for the gradual activation of BIM.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2599036423"}}

Limited and unavailable workspace for crews on the jobsite results in losses of productivity. With the increased usage of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the construction industry, four dimensional animation that brings together the three dimensional model of a building and its construction schedule to visualize construction process is emerging. To support space planning in the preconstruction management, this research provides a framework to integrate the knowledge of work envelope requirements among piping and steel trades. Typical work envelope requirements were defined through in-depth interviews with superintendents on U.S. industrial projects. Therefore, the rules and semantic information extracted from the interviews were summarized in seven decision trees, describing the geometric parameters relative to the body parts (e.g. chest and eye height). To compare the level of work envelope overlaps among global populations, anthropomorphic data was used to assess the absolute dimensions of the work envelopes. The results show that some work envelope requirements have a limited tolerance and are more sensitive to different body dimensions across global populations. It was found that in such situations the population anthropomorphic characteristics significantly impact the work envelope requirements. Therefore, this paper presents a decision supporting tool of work envelope requirements in compliment to space planning, which can improve the productivity, accuracy and efficiency of workspace management in the piping and steel trades.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2534605526"}}

The aim of this research study is to understand the impacts of Building Information Modelling (BIM) on communication patterns of construction projects. This has been investigated through the identification of current communication patterns within the construction sector. A communication framework has been constructed which identifies a set of characteristics and defines benchmarks according to those patterns that can be managed during BIM implementation. This thesis has examined the issues surrounding the use of e-mail and BIM and addresses the potential that BIM has to increase electronic communication caused by traditional and disjointed working practices as well as lack of pre-defined communication protocols. This research finds that today the use of e-mail has become inevitable which promotes the exchange of documents as attachments. However, BIM is introducing new ways of working in which the industry is bound to move from a document-centric environment to a more data-driven environment utilising intelligent and data rich information models. The study continues to discuss that the integration of BIM as a collaboration platform is not as advanced as the industry sector perceives and proposes the necessity of a greater understanding of current communication practices, which can be addressed by the development of a conceptual framework of communication.  This study has utilised a mixed method strategy with a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods and it was divided into two stages. The initial stage employed two research techniques; a pilot study and focus groups. This stage was largely exploratory and set out to understand and observe current trends with regards to construction communication and used an inductive reasoning to generate a hypothesis. The second stage of the study was explanatory to explain the impacts of BIM on communication patterns of construction projects using descriptive analysis as well as using deductive reasoning to achieve a clear demonstration and a validation of the hypothesis. During this stage electronic communication patterns and peoples\u2018 activities were critically evaluated via data mining techniques on a large dataset provided by a 4Projects, a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. Conclusions of the research highlight the potential for better understanding of the impacts of BIM on communication patterns though the development of a conceptual communication framework and the use of contextualised maturity models.  This research has identified opposing views within the industry with regards to the impact of BIM on communication patterns within construction projects. These views are polarised into the belief at one extreme that BIM will lead to improved communication and at the other that BIM will lead to increased unmanaged and unreliable information exchanges during design and construction of projects. The results of this thesis also demonstrate a wide range of concerns around communication practices. These issues are due to the growth of the industry in relation to technology, organisation size, project complexity, cultural changes and innovation. Some of the key cultural barriers include; digital engineering capability and competency, cost-driven culture, shift from document and records management to data and information management, legal and commercial aspects of project contracts, collaborative frameworks, education, training and support and leadership in a digital construction which need to be resolved in order to obtain the most benefit from BIM as a collaboration platform.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2625901260"}}

Ensuring that all resources required to complete a task (materials, equipment, etc.) are available is essential to create a reliable workflow. Yet, in customized house building, clients\u2019 design information (e.g., design drawings containing clients\u2019 desired changes) is a key input that is often missing. This can affect the performance of the task in which such input is first needed and all subsequent ones. In spite of that, this theme has received limited attention by the literature. It is not yet clear how to manage customization strategies to minimize disruptions in production or how to quantify the workflow variations created by distinct strategies. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a set of guidelines to manage customization strategies (i.e., clients\u2019 information flow and scope of customization) to support a reliable workflow. A visual indicator is also proposed and applied in two projects (completed in 2011 and 2014) with distinct customization strategies. The results suggest that workflow variations (due to customization) were lower in the latter project. The changes in the strategy that led to the improvements measured are discussed. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by (1) presenting guidelines to manage clients\u2019 information flow in customized projects; (2) proposing a visual indicator to measure and compare workflow variations created by different customization strategies; (3) suggesting tactics that can be incorporated in full-customization strategies to reduce workflow variations; and (4) critically examining the mass customization theoretical background and its role in addressing construction problems.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2278173804"}}

The challenges reside in the classic gap between academic focus on disciplinary principles and the industry needs for specific application proficiency. As a result, architecture and civil engineering education needs to embrace the opportunities provided by BIM and overcome the challenges presented by BIM to remain current and relevant. A growing number of architecture, engineering, and construction programs have begun to offer courses that include BIM-related content, and a few programs have strategies in place to fully integrate it.

Customizing and preparing such models for project delivery takes a large amount of time and, unfortunately, cannot guarantee that the physical building or part can be built as modeled; a disconnect between design intent and constructability can often occur. One reason for this is that design team is unaware of certain details that are involved in fabricating and assembling building components; an understanding that craftsmen take for granted. This paper presents the process of incorporating Autodesk Revit into the workflow of an architectural precast concrete manufacturer, tracking a real-world project from design intent model through the incorporation of industry-specific fabrication details. Methods used to generate a novel digital model, as well as to produce shop drawings and shop tickets from that model are documented. Three approaches to creating custom Revit models are described: using parametric Revit families; through Dynamo scripting; and via Excel spreadsheet input. Future potential workflows which could extend the findings even further are discussed, setting the groundwork for 'Design-Assist', an emerging project delivery approach wherein subcontractors are engaged early in project development to provide advice to the design team, allowing for more informed decisions, conversations, and digital models for construction.

As the practical use of BIM-based design grows, its influence expands into the field of interior architecture design. BIM makes possible to check various design plan, reach decision making in an effective way, and change design plan in an efficient method. Therefore, BIM is also promising field in interior architecture design. However, compared to other fields such as architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, there have been less research and projects on BIM in the field of interior architecture design. For increasing the feasibility of adapting BIM in interior architecture design, this paper describes a case study-projecting images for designing interior panels using parametric modeling. This process needs elaborate, delicate, and precise steps for harmonious output. For steady using of the building, users look forward to the design plan which can be variable and changeable according to user?s preference and the environment. Therefore, demand for parametric design in the interior design part such as panel pattern design for various decoration is growing. The process in this paper deals with an advanced phase which is effective in decreasing time consumption and useless part of the traditional process. Finally, this paper suggests the possibility of using BIM in the interior design process and field where BIM can be applied.

The architect should be able to intuitively select materials and design elements that are the most suitable for the building from among diverse curtain wall systems. However, in the current curtain wall design processes that are mostly implemented in 2D, lots of problems are occurring. Therefore, the BIM-based curtain wall design automation module should be developed.

Curtain wall library components are classified according to the locations, functions, and LODs. Finally, basic shape information of components according to LODs is defined.

This research seeks to address complex issues related to stadia design, with a particular focus on parametric terrace modelling. Using advanced Building Information Modelling (BIM) processes and techniques, a dynamic 3D model is developed which automates c-value and capacity calculations, improving efficiency and quality within design firms. The scope of this research has been confined to the activity area, terrace, seating, barriers and gangways. These design areas, particularly terraces\u2019, provide constant headaches for designers due to strict regulations. Simplifying this process enables designers to spend more time designing and less time modelling based on meticulous calculations. All aspects of this research have been developed directly within native BIM software to determine if designers really need visual programming to facilitate parametric stadia design. A mixed method approach has been adopted, using quantitative analysis for capturing design formulas and associated parameters, and qualitative discussion addressing problematic and successful aspects of parametric design. It soon became apparent that one parametric family would not be capable of providing designers with the flexibility to meet the significant number of variables associated with stadia design. As such, several families were created using different templates and tools, then federated using a four level nesting methodology. Other findings highlighted that shared parameters are essential to automate data flow to schedules, whilst the incorporation of 3D seats within the terrace family dramatically slows design iterations. That being said, a 20,000 capacity stadium with seats was created in under an hour using the parametric stadia models developed during this research. Conclusions drawn from this research show that complex parametric stadia design can be achieved without the need for third party visual programming software.

Building information modelling is currently an emerging technology within the building industry in the UK and in China as well as throughout t he world. The departments of Civil Engineering and Architecture and Built Environment at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China have been gradually introducing Building Information Modelling content into their courses over the last few years and have pl ans to further increase this area by introducing Building Information Modelling teaching at Master\u2019s level in its Geospatial Engineering courses. The introduction of the teaching of Building Information Modelling has been seen as a priority by the Faculty of Science and Engineering and has been introduced to 1st year students as part of existing modules that traditionally teach Computer Aided Design and also by the introduction of two new optional modules in the final year of undergraduate study. The teachi ng of Building Information Modelling focuses on three main areas, management for architecture and civil engineering, Modelling using BIM modelling software from design plans, and data collection and processing for As - Built BIM model creation from laser sca nning. Teaching takes the form of standard lectures and tutorial classes but focuses more on using hands on teaching methods and group work using both equipment for data collection and software for modelling testing. To aid this teaching the University o f Nottingham will establish a BIM teaching and research lab at their campus in Ningbo. This lab will be equipped with extensive BIM software and other modelling tools and facilities that will complement the already extensive surveying and mapping equipment and software available at the Ningbo campus. This paper will outline the teaching content used and give examples of student work on the newly developed modules as well as describing planned future developments in BIM teaching at the University of Nottingh am. It also provides an example and initial analysis of these new teaching methods and how they contribute to current industry requirements.

The demand for BIM implementation within the AEC industry has recently increased. BIM has therefore, becomes one of the significant methods for solving and preventing issues within the AEC industry. This has motivated governments and owners to require BIM within their projects, such as the UK and the USA. As the result, many construction companies and architectural firms have taken the initiative to implement BIM within their systems. However, there are some barriers that organisations face in terms of the implementation of BIM such as the lack of experts in BIM, resources, hardware and software and so on. Many scholars believe that BIM must be embedded within the AEC education sector to help close the gap between AEC education and AEC industry. Hence, several AEC schools have introduced BIM within their curriculum. Also, there are two BIM frameworks (BIM Academic Forum BAF initial Framework and IMAC framework) to embed BIM within the AEC education. However, none of these two have been evaluated yet and both of them are very general to use for Undergraduate Architecture Programmes. To dates, academics have not reached a consensus in how BIM should be taught within undergraduate architectural programmes. In term of The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the vision is unclear for BIM within the AEC industry and AEC education. There is some evidence that reveal the need for BIM in KSA such as the number of BIM jobs required and some other non-academic resources calling for the need of BIM to be implemented within Saudi projects. However, the number, size, cost and complexity of projects in KSA which have suffered from many issues such as payment plans, delays, lack of Saudi experts and discontinued projects is worthy for motivating the Saudi Government and construction companies to implement BIM. Therefore, the aim of this study is to propose a strategic approach for embedding BIM within undergraduate architectural programmes in KSA. This aim is achieved through the development and understanding of the current teaching strategy of BIM within AEC education sectors and the industry perspectives in relation to BIM implementation. To achieve this aim quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection were adopted in order to asset the level of utilization of BIM within the AEC industry and education sector in KSA. As well as identifying educational gaps for utilizing BIM in architectural programmes in KSA. Misunderstanding BIM, the lack of development within architecture education sector in KSA and unacceptable output for AEC industry are three of the most significant findings from the quantitative data analysis. The qualitative data helped to outline the method of how BIM should be embedded. Most interviewees had realised the benefits of collaboration using BIM, and indicated their preface to introducing BIM to Integrated Design Studio with high support from other modules. The proposed BIM framework was validated by academics and professionals within KSA using semi-structured interview whereby, most comments were focusing on developing the level of awareness of BIM amongs academics. This study proposed a number of recommendations for AEC industry in KSA, academics who are interesting in integrating BIM within the curricula and researchers with an interest in BIM within AEC industry.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2509838825"}}

The management of data, information and knowledge through the project life cycle of buildings and civil infrastructure projects is becoming increasingly complex. In an attempt to drive efficiencies and address this complexity, the United Kingdom (UK) Government has mandated that Building Information Modelling (BIM) methods must be adopted in all public sector construction projects from 2016. Emerging from the US Department of Defence, BIM is an approach to the co-ordination of design and production data using object-oriented principles as described in ISO 29481-1:2010. The underlying philosophy of BIM is to ensure the ?provision of a single environment to store shared asset data and information, accessible to all individuals who are required to produce, use and maintain it? (PAS 1192-2:2013). A key aspect of BIM lies in the notion of ?interoperability? between various software applications used in the design and construction process and a common data format for the efficient exchange of design information and knowledge. Protagonists of BIM argue that this interoperability provides an effective environment for collaboration between actors in the construction process and creates accurate, reliable, repeatable and high-quality information exchange. This UK Government mandate presents numerous challenges to the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) professions; in particular, the characteristics of BIM Level 2 remain explicitly undefined and this has created a degree of uncertainty amongst the promoters and those professionals charged with delivering projects. This uncertainty is further reflected in UK higher education; contemporary undergraduate programmes in civil engineering across the UK are, on the whole, at the bottom of the BIM ?maturity curve?. UK higher education institutions are increasingly being challenged to embrace BIM through appropriate pedagogies and teaching practices but the supporting guidance is emergent and variable. In the case of civil engineering programmes in the UK, the Joint Board of Moderators (JBM) has issued a ?good practice guide? as have the Higher Education Academy (HEA) under the auspices of the ?BIM Academic Forum?. Nevertheless, a clear demand for further research to explore the technical and pedagogical issues associated with BIM integration into degree programmes remains.The research described in this thesis casts a critical lens on the current literature in the domains of object-oriented modelling of infrastructure and the associated implications for procurement and project management. A mixed-methods approach using questionnaire analysis, focus groups and secondary case study analysis was used to enact an inductive research approach that captures a range of data on pedagogic issues and considerations associated with the integration of BIM into the design of a new civil engineering curricular. The findings include recommendations for the ?up-skilling? of university teachers and academics, enhancing student employability and the development of suitable learning and learning techniques. A framework for the incorporation of BIM principles, concepts and technologies into civil engineering programmes is proposed. The findings of the research suggest that the first two years of study in a typical, accredited civil engineering degree programme should focus on the technical concepts relating to design from a modelling and analysis perspective. The latter years of the degree should focus on the development of ?soft-skills? required to enable effective teamwork and collaboration within a multidisciplinary project environment. Further studies should seek to test the proposed framework in a ?live? environment, particularly in the context of the necessity to balance the demands of summative and formative assessment regimes.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2566068467"}}

Building Information Modelling (BIM) has become a well-known established extensive collaborative process and an important area of development in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry and has transcended all disciplines. The use of BIM in construction projects can possibly increase the information quality needed for making critical design decisions to access a building\u2018s environmental impact. Analysis, design and infrastructure of buildings are formulated with the help of samples generated from BIM. In the last decade, BIM has witnessed an increasing development. This was a result of their rapid capabilities applicable to construction projects. BIM can generate a common language for all divisions of parties and systems in a project and make them a combined team. The BIM method is strongly matched with delivery systems for integrated projects. Harnessing the unrealized possibility of the full life cycle use of the model by integrating it with the amenities and property management phases of buildings and infrastructure is one of the advantages of BIM which makes it suitable to the industry. This analysis is intended to show the correspondence of BIM and project manager\u2018s roles on construction projects. It insists on the significance of proper knowledge and experience of project managers to get succeeded in BIM. Initially, this review presents an in-depth analysis of present literature frameworks and surrounding methodologies to assess and examine the BIM advantages and static design. Then 3D, 4D BIM and BIM based scheduling techniques are examined. The use of the term 4D to refer to the fourth dimension time is also discussed. i.e. 4D is 3D + schedule (time). The role of 4D BIM is to add a novel dimension to 3D CAD or solid modelling. The paper also reviews the issues regarding the BIM implementation, static design and intrinsic problems related with an attempt to assess the advantages in a purely quantitative fashion. Through the application of BIM technology for the dynamic querying and statistical investigation of construction schedules, engineering, resources and costs are the three implementations considered to be proved as how BIM can ease the extensive grasp of a project\u2018s implementation and progress. Recognition, conflict solving, contradictions between construction resources and control costs, decreasing project over-spends and protecting the resource supply are also dealt with. A BIM overview with specifications on its core and cycle concepts, benefits of the project life with the help of surveys has been discussed. The paper also elaborates risks and obstacles in BIM implementation and future BIM trends.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2485446124"}}

First, we drew the criteria from literature review to analyze the building code. And then, we analyzed building code and sorted objects and properties for automated building code checking. After that we made mapping table between the sorted data and IFC specification. Using the mapping table, we developed pre-specification about building codes information that does not exist in IFC specification. And the defined information can be used to develop the BIM modeling guide and national building permission system.

The purpose of this study is as follows. Thank to the rapid advance of a digital technology and an information technology, there has been active research into process simulation-based project management job interlinking process management with 3D design also in construction management. Recently, As the construction industry has been growing in size and complexity, the utilization of BIM is increased to improve effective management and integration of information. BIM(Building Information Modeling) has been focused on architecture, engineering, construction and maintenance field. However, There is a lack of BIM research on Interior Architecture fields. So It needs more research in this area. The purpose of this study is as follows : through a previous study that review on BIM applicability of commercial building interior design, this study propose a process of MD Plan and utilization planning for commercial building Interior design based on BIM. As a result of this, BIM library, 3D simulation, automation for quantity estimation and information management can improve efficiency of business and help decision making for MD plan. However, existing construction management systems merely play the role of saving and sharing information through a field management system. This study is supposed to be utilized as a construction management alternative for d decision-making support while proposing another possibility to those engaged in related industries and academic circles.

In order to introduce and promote BIM in the field of landscape design, this study developed a prototype of a library and template and analyzed the performance of trial application. For the development of a prototype, annotations and types were analyzed from floor plans of existing small parks, and components of landscape template were deduced. Based on this, play facilities, pergola, and benches were madeintofamily and templates, making automatic design possible. In addition, annotations and tags that are often used in landscape design were made, and a 3D view was materialized through visibility/graphic reassignment. As for tables and quantities, boundary stone table, mounding table, summary sheet of quantities, table of contents, and summary sheet of packaging quantities were grouped and connected with floor plans; regarding landscaping trees, classification criteria and name of trees that are suitable for domestic situations were applied. A landscape template was created to enable the library file format(rfa) that can be mounted on a building with BIM programs. As for problems that arose after the trial application of the prepared template, some CAD files could not be imported; also, while writing tables, the basis of calculation could not be made automatically. Regarding this, it is thought that functions of a BIM program and template need improvement.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2317226274"}}

This research is to recognise the function of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in design optimization for irregular shaped buildings. The study focuses on a conceptual irregular shaped \u201ctwisted\u201d building design similar to some existing sculpture-like architectures. Form and function are the two most important aspects of new buildings, which are becoming more sophisticated as parts of equally sophisticated \u201csystems\u201d that we are living in. Nowadays, it is common to have irregular shaped or sculpture-like buildings which are very different when compared to regular buildings. Construction industry stakeholders are facing stiff challenges in many aspects such as buildability, cost effectiveness, delivery time and facility management when dealing with irregular shaped building projects. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is being utilized to enable architects, engineers and constructors to gain improved visualization for irregular shaped buildings; this has a purpose of identifying critical issues before initiating physical construction work. In this study, three variations of design options differing in rotating angle: 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees are created to conduct quantifiable comparisons. Discussions are focused on three major aspects including structural planning, usable building space, and structural constructability. This research concludes that Building Information Modelling is instrumental in facilitating design optimization for irregular shaped building. In the process of comparing different design variations, instead of just giving \u201cyes or no\u201d type of response, stakeholders can now easily visualize, evaluate and decide to achieve the right balance based on their own criteria.

Every architectural and building engineering design in the AEC/FM (Architectural, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management) domain is subject to conformance with a diverse range of statutory requirements and standards before the official consent for construction may be granted by the relevant authority. There is an enormous amount of information to process and share among the stakeholders for this to occur. Historically, building information has been exchanged in the domain using paper-based drawings and written specifications. Auditing a building design for compliance, for example, has been a manual undertaking against a voluminous corpus of paperbased legal texts that are written in natural language intended for human interpretation. This paper-based practice is resource intensive, inefficient, and error-prone, which has sometimes resulted in costly remediations of problem buildings and even loss of lives. It is also a factor for declining productivity in the domain. There are now methods of sharing digital building information via building information modelling (BIM), which promotes better collaboration and provides more opportunities for automation in the compliant building design process. However, there has not been a successful standard automated compliance audit implementation to date despite considerable research effort over the years. This research has explored a practical approach where human designers retain their natural role of making compliant design decisions. Machines are only given the task of doing what they do best, which is to execute repetitive instructions and procedures consistently and accurately. The findings of the research suggest that this human-machine partnership approach allows conventional compliant design procedures (CDPs) to be formalised as executable workflows to guide the automated audit of BIM models against regulatory knowledge models (RKMs). An important criterion in the approach is that CDP and RKM representations must be manageable by the domain experts equipped with only basic computing skills. A software framework (ARCABIM) has been developed to illustrate the approach using a test building model for evaluation. The potential of interfacing with external computational tools required to audit against qualitative performance-based criteria is described. A fire compliance model (FCM) representing a BIM model view for the compliant fire safety design of buildings has been developed and used in a case study to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in conjunction with an RKM representing a performance-based fire safety design method of the New Zealand Building Code.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2342448426"}}

The management of data, information and knowledge through the project life cycle of buildings and civil infrastructure projects is becoming increasingly complex. As an attempt to drive efficiencies and address this complexity, the United Kingdom Government has mandated that Building Information Modelling (BIM) methods must be adopted in all public sector construction projects in 2016. Emerging from the US Department of Defence, BIM is an approach to the co-ordination of design and production data using object-oriented principles as described in ISO 29481-1:2010. The underlying philosophy of BIM is to ensure the \u201cprovision of a single environment to store shared asset data and information, accessible to all individuals who are required to produce, use and maintain it\u201d (PAS 1192-2:2013). A key aspect of BIM lies in the notion of \u2018interoperability\u2019 between various software applications used in the design and construction process and a common data format for the efficient exchange of design information and knowledge. Protagonists of BIM argue that this interoperability provides an effective environment for collaboration between actors in the construction process and creates accurate, reliable, repeatable and high-quality information exchange. This UK government mandate presents numerous challenges to the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) professions; in particular, the characteristics of BIM Level 2 remain explicitly undefined and this created a degree of uncertainty amongst the promoters and those professionals charged with delivering projects. This research casts a critical lens on the current literature in the domains of object-oriented modelling of infrastructure and the associated implications for procurement and project management.

Building information modeling (BIM) is an important technology in the design and construction of buildings. BIM is also used in the construction of building equipment. In recent years, construction companies have been promoting the introduction of BIM. Typically, the technologies of building construction are introduced for each department. However, BIM has been promoting technology introduction beyond departments and companies. Therefore, we analyzed the process of introducing BIM in construction companies. We also analyzed the proportion of companies that introduced BIM, process of technology introduction, and the organizational form of the construction companies. In this study, we conducted a questionnaire survey of construction companies about BIM. Based on the questionnaire results, we performed an analysis of corporate organization as follows. 1. Analyze the relationship between the respondents of a department and technician experts by cross tabulation. 2. Classify respondents by factor analysis. 3. Discuss the motivation behind introducing BIM by covariance structure analysis. The percentage of companies that have used BIM in their construction projects was approximately 32%. Moreover, 40% of the survey respondents collect BIM information. More than 50% of the respondents think that construction work using BIM is more efficient than the traditional construction work. These results mean that BIM entered a stage of popularity. On the other hand, the percentage of engineers that manipulate 3D-CAD or BIM is only approximately 23%. The occupation of the highest percentage of 3D-CAD users is construction engineers of building equipment. Architects are also a high percentage of 3D-CAD users. Then, we created a contingency table (Table 4) for the relationship between the current department and the specialized field of survey respondents. All personnel who belong to the building construction department are part of the specialized field of building construction. On the other hand, 22% of the personnel who belong to the architectural design department are part of a different specialized field of architectural design. Next, we performed an exploratory factor analysis on the questionnaire results. Maximum likelihood estimation with a promax rotation of 32 Likert scale questions was conducted on data gathered from 212 participants. The results of the promax rotation of the solution are listed in Table 8. When loadings less than 0.35 were excluded, the analysis yielded a seven-factor solution. The seven factors were labeled as follows: \"Expectations of BIM (Factor 1)\", \"The degree of information gathering about BIM (Factor 2)\", \"The need for the introduction of front-loading (Factor 3)\", \"IT skill levels of the respondents (Factor 4)\", \u201cAdequacy of information equipment in the belonging company (Factor 5)\u201d, \u201cGrowth potential of the construction industry (Factor 6)\u201d, and \u201cDissatisfaction with the current construction technology (Factor 7).\u201d Moreover, we performed a hierarchical cluster analysis by selecting three factors\u2014Factor 2, Factor 4, and Factor 6. As a result, we classified four respondent groups. In addition, we analyzed of the motivation behind the introduction of BIM by structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of SEM analysis are shown in Fig. 12. SEM supposes that motivations behind introducing BIM are to improve productivity of the construction work.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2513688582"}}

Most of the projects in the built environment system are unique in nature and different in design, construction, and operations. Thus, it is difficult to establish a streamlined flow in the entire process of the complex built environment system and to arrange and optimize the required resources in a timely manner. To address this challenge, it is necessary to reduce the complexity of the built environment system and to provide the decision-makers with timely and accurate information for making better decisions. For achieving this objective, this paper aims to develop a conceptual framework for an Intelligent Planning Unit (IPU) for the complex built environment system, which consists of three phases (i.e., IPU planning, IPU application, and IPU network). An IPU represents a well-defined planning unit that can be initiated to achieve a specific purpose (e.g., cost, schedule, materials, and process). An IPU can be defined by breaking down the physical entities and processes in the complex built environment system into carefully planned units (even nano-scale units). A well-defined IPU can be replicated and implemented at the different levels of complexity; and then, it can be improved through a refinement process using the intelligent feature of communication. This paper illustrated the IPU concept through several examples and also highlighted possible challenges and opportunities in implementing the IPU concept in the complex built environment system. This paper is designed to ensure that a project meets the client expectations on various aspects in the complex built environment system.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2537608137"}}

When performing design tasks, architects think in terms of space, and act on physical elements. They often use various representation means to shape and to communicate the complex aspects of space. Architectural representation is often driven by visual perception whilst current BIM practices seem to be based on semantics associated with scheduling building items (element, position, quantity, etc.). The reduction of architectural sensitive approaches to merely technical ones, reveals only quantitative and restrictive information that does not reflect the architect's multi-sensorial experience. This paper examines some recent model proposals which include descriptions of architectural space concept, and tries to suggest a possible synthesis of this work. It focuses on cooperative practices necessary to unveil the sensitive dimension of the architectural design, and presents a state of existing BIM tools based on relevant tasks used in these practices in order to acquire more knowledge about the concepts which ensure a cooperative work taking into account the sensitive spatial aspects.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3040888916"}}

This thesis is about BIM (Building Information Model/Modelling) and answer from The Railroad Industries point of view the questions asked in the report. There are different perceptions in the industry about what BIM means and what it is. This thesis will try to clarify the meaning of the concept BIM. Further on the thesis examines to which extent and how BIM is used in the railroad industry where the purpose has been to follow up Trafikverkets investment on implementing BIM. To do this Trafikverkets strategies and regulations has been studied. Beyond that focus has been on processes in the building industry where the purpose has been if there is knowledge that can be applied on the railroad industry. Finally the thesis treats in short terms signalling design and BIM. To many people BIM is a new way of working but it has been around for a while. Already in the end of the 1970\u2019s some industries started using 3D-modelling. It is important to point out that BIM is not a computer program but it is a way of working with 3D-modelling and how to handle the information in those models. The thesis is based on a literature study where most of the literature is coming from the building industry because they are ahead in the development of using BIM.

Implementation of BIM in the Municipal Plan Review Process Liz Shantalle Ricardo Belliard School of Technology, BYU Master of Science Obtaining a building permit is an important step for any construction project. Whether it is for a new construction or a remodel job, the process involves a plan review performed by building officials. The purpose of this research was to explore ways in which Building Information Modeling (BIM) could be used to aid code officials during the plan review process. The objectives of the study were to determine if the level of detail in BIM was complete enough to allow a plan review to be perform accurately, to identify the extent to which architects are comfortable with using their models for the plan review, and to identify barriers to implementation. A case study was conducted where BIM was used to supplement the traditional 2D plans plan review process. Additionally, a survey was given to local architects to obtain their thoughts on using BIM in the plan review process. The research found that BIM has the potential of helping code officials visualize the project, extract information from objects, and allow them to have a better understanding of unique building features relationship to other building elements. Challenges of using BIM in the plan review process identified by architects included: the accuracy of the model, the level of detail modeled, legal implications, and ability of reviewers to use BIM.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2524847681"}}

Today cost estimates are performed in different stages by different actors, however, it is generally not a part of the architectural practice. In the design phase, each change in choice of design will impact the total project cost, but despite this, architects have been seen to be poor at being cost aware. It has further been stated in research that cost estimates are made too late in projects, which often leads to compromises being made on the design later on. Further, research on cost estimates in projects raising the architect focus and perspective is limited. This study sets out to investigate this gap, and looks at cost estimations from the architect perspective. Among the different existing methods and tools for cost estimations, are ones based on Building Information Modeling (BIM). However, it has been questioned whether all available tools are applicable for early stages of projects, and further for the architect profession. The main objectives of this study have been to identify the values and challenges for architects in performing cost estimations in the early design phase, and to identify whether BIM could impact or support this. Consequently, if new cost estimation processes or practices within an architectural firm are to be implemented, there are factors important to consider. Therefore, this study looks at implementation management, including barriers and challenges one might be facing. This study can be especially valuable for architect firms looking to see how their practices could develop. The research methodology included a theoretical review, as well as a case study at an architectural firm where 11 semi-structured interviews were conducted. Additionally, interviews were held with two clients of the architect firm. Main findings of this study include that there are many values in architect firms performing cost estimates and simultaneously raising their overall cost awareness. BIM was concluded to be able to support in this context. However, there were also challenges found in this context; some specifically related to architects being able to do such, some concerning the internal processes, and others more general. The values of these cost estimates were concluded to be largest internally for the architect firm itself. However, findings suggest that winnings can be concluded to exist also on the broader perspective, by increasing the project cost dialogue between all parties involved on the project and leading to overall better project outcomes.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2528812637"}}

In 21st century, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is one of the most eminent advancement that has taken place in architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. BIM provides a digital platform for managing the functional and physical characteristics of a building throughout its lifecycle. It offers a collaborative approach for design, planning, construction and operation of the facility. BIM has served to satisfy the objectives of AEC industry to improve productivity and quality of project delivered, curtail the project delivery time and cost. BIM enables architects and engineers to visualize any design, construction, managerial or operational barrier which may arise during the actual construction activities. Also, BIM finds the application of cloud computing which enables all the stakeholders to access data related to construction project. As the visualization and hardware technology is improving, the framework approach is moving from \u201cclient based\u201d to \u201chost based\u201d which is referred to as Cloud Computing.

The increased use of BIM in the building sector have led certain actors to commence riding on the big data hype. Big data techniques allow the use of unstructured data alongside structured data to an extent that was previously impossible. Science and technology studies (STS) approaches are used to examine information standards as a technology to organise big data applications in building. Crucially, opportunities are strongly guided by the data that is collected about buildings, and thus by the understanding of what a building is. Building information standards are viewed as performative and their becoming as a process of power, understanding and emerging interests. The empirical material stems from a study on the shaping of a Danish classification standard and its implementation in a Danish hospital project. The analysis shows several performative aspects and particular ways in which a building can be understood: First, there is a focus on the internal structure of a building as a product and less on the process that leads to making a product. Second, a systems theory approach to building structure understands building components as having functions in a way that aligns well with the installation part of the building. Third, delimitations within which information standards propose to collect data implies a focus on building components as material over components being economical entities. Performativity struggles during the shaping of the standard are expected to continue also during its implementation phase in an environment where multiple standards co-exist. On this background we discuss whether the building information standard, meant to be a big data technology enabler, might become a barrier for big data.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2568093500"}}

The second service uses several facade-layout configuration algorithms, using as underlying engine the constraint solver Choco, to generate compliant layout-plan solutions. We show that by dividing filtering and search, and by coupling the two constraint-based systems, we gain modularity and efficiently as each service focuses on their own strengths.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2244988396"}}

There is a phenomenon that many people increasingly demand for Korean Housing (Hanok) and wooden houses away from apartment living for their health and country life. However, these types of housing in Korea is not sizable for industrialization. Therefore, participants for Hanok are usually individuals or small organizations. However, in order to expand Hanok diffusion, it is required to apply efficient methods for the engineering and construction processes. In order to resolve this issue, this study developed a web-based and automated 5D CAD system with standard forms. For implementing automated BIM analysis, the proposed processes include pre-defined standard 3D objects, cost/schedule data with standard forms and methods. All templates and documents can be automatically associated by using pre-defined standard numbering system. Therefore, the users can simply use provided forms for integration, and when changed design, users can also use this system in a fully integrated method without knowing the complex methods behind the screen (Korean & US Patented by Myongji University).", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2240106652"}}

This paper presents the process of implementation of a building information model for managing an existing building, identifying a development framework and documenting the difficulties that occurred during the implementation of the initial stages. The use of building information modelling (BIM) for the design and construction phase of a building has been thoroughly looked into by researchers and practitioners and there is evidence to support that it is beneficial for reducing cost, time and improving communication. A single shared building information model results in a greater accuracy, clarity and consistency of the information available during the life cycle compared to traditional 2D/3D drawings. Yet the potential use of BIM for the operational and management phase (facilities management), besides maintenance schedules and equipment information and location, is still not clearly identified. The UK Government, institutional clients and major private owners are now demanding BIM for new construction and major refurbishment, but given that 70\u201375% of the UK building stock that will exist and be in use in 2050 has already been built, a significant part of the existing facilities will not have a building information model till the next major refurbishment.

BIM-based building condition assessment (BCA) is an emerging method that should be explored and practiced to obtain the benefits of BIM in building management and maintenance process. The purpose of this paper is to explore the BIM-based condition assessment method by conducting a survey on the water ponding defect on a flat roof. The survey was conducted by a visual inspection and pictorial. A written report was produced after the survey. A 3D BIM model was generated by using Revit Architecture. This model was then integrated with Tekla BIMsight to produce a 4D model that consists of a 3D building view and building information. General building inspection was conducted to determine the existing condition of the flat roof and any possibility of the water ponding defect. Results show that water ponding occurs on flat roof areas during and after heavy rainfall because water does not efficiently flow through the rainwater downpipes (RWDPs). This obstruction in water flow is caused by the presence of dirt and the insufficient number of RWDPs in certain areas. Furthermore, BIM-based BCA shows a positive effect by providing a 4D model that is easy to understand, access, and store by the building management team.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1827817016"}}

Abstract Using BIM to support Habitat for Humanity: A case study Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a digital, parametric, model-centric approach toproject delivery in the AEC industry. Among the many advantages of BIM is the ability toaccurately model real-world construction as well as to embed information in the components ofthe computer model. These can include attributes such as the physical properties of buildingcomponents and the cost of components and materials. This information can be extracted fromthe model for analysis. Additionally, any changes to the geometry of the BIM model canautomatically update information queries such as schedules and cost estimates. This paper documents a graduate level research project developed to investigatestrategies to enable a local chapter of Habitat for Humanity, often referred to as Habitat, tooptimize project estimating and scheduling by utilizing BIM. Habitat is an international non-profit organization that builds and repairs housing for low income families by utilizing the laborof volunteers and partner families, efficient building methods, modest house sizes and no-profitloans. While the project is based on a standardized housing prototype, there are typicallyvariables related to labor and material expenses on each individual house that is constructed. Forthe local Habitat associated with this project, each project varied in terms of material and labordonations, particularly in regards to project components that required skills beyond that ofvolunteers such as foundation work and mechanical system installation. The project goal was to utilize BIM in a manner which could assist Habitat in twoprimary ways. The first was to develop a method to document the cost variances and the use theBIM model to generate estimates for each individual project using the prototype. The second wasto use the BIM model to assist in helping volunteer laborers to better visualize the constructionsequence. This required the development of atypical modeling and cost estimating approaches.The paper documents the evolution of the project, modeling strategies that were employed, andthe final project outcomes.

BIM utilization in construction can detect any clash analysis during the design stage, improves efficiency of project scheduling, reduce costs and ensure high quality of the project as well as facilitate communication among construction players. Since it has been introduced by the PWD, several projects have been constructed and being constructed using BIM and one of the project is The National Cancer Institute (NCI). The project is owned by the Malaysian government. This paper discusses the application of BIM in the project, the first project launched by the Malaysian government. A literature review was conducted to explore previous BIM studies on the history of BIM, benefits and importance, barriers and challenges as well as existing BIM projects in the Malaysian construction industry. Furthermore, semi-structured interviews were carried out with the client, consultant and contractor involved in the project. The interviews results reveal necessities and benefits of implementing BIM in completing the project. BIM is necessary for construction because its implementation can increase project quality. It is useful in assisting construction players to complete projects successfully. The results provide clear evidence of the effectiveness of implementing BIM in government projects.

In massive projects such as tunneling construction, computational modeling can be useful for several planning, execution and control activities during the lifecycle of the project. An analysis of the building requirements was done in a particular case study with the aim of evaluating how the current computational schemas support tunneling activities during the construction phase. Then, these requirements were compared with the Model View Definitions (MVD) used by the Industry Foundation Classes version 4 (IFC4) from BuildingSmart. Finally, based on this comparison, an assessment on how IFC4 supports tunneling activities was performed. The construction of the new subway station 'Estaci\u00f3n \u00d1u\u00f1oa' (one of the new ten stations of the subway system of Santiago, Chile), was used as the case study. Its building requirements, specifications and tasks were gathered and studied. Since excavation and structural support of the tunnel represent the largest investment of the project the analysis was performed on these tasks. This study summarizes the information requirements of these tasks and whether or not they are supported by the IFC4. Based on our findings, a proposal to include the not-supported information requirements in the current IFC4 schema is presented.

The implementation of BIM has focused largely on Architectural, Structural, as well as specialist Mechanical and Electrical disciplines, but it remains perceived mainly as a design tool or at best a visualization tool in 3D or 4D. Instead, we have to go beyond BIM and begin to embrace the notion of virtual design and construction (VDC). It is a concept or approach to build, visualize, analyze, and evaluate project performance virtually and early before a large expenditure of time and resources is made. Although BIM could form the backbone of this approach, its success requires a relook of the processes.

However, BIM has not yet been leveraged to its full capability with regard to construction prefabrication, due in part to the fact that BIM models are only roughly designed by architects and engineers.

Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to find optimal solutions for conceptual design automation, which can be integrated with Building Information Modelling (BIM) support for construction automation. Problems relating ostensibly to failures in computational support for the conceptual design stage are well-documented in extant literature. These failures are multifarious and significant, with several deficiencies being acknowledged in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Whilst acknowledging this, extant literature has highlighted the importance of computational design in the AEC industry; and failures in this area include the need to strengthen the congruent links and support mechanisms in order to exploit the opportunities presented by new computational design methods. Given this, it is postulated that the application of generative design could enhance the design experience by assisting designers with the iterative generation of alternatives and parameterisation (change management) processes. Moreover, as BIM applications are increasingly providing comprehensive support for modelling and management, then additional synergies could be examined for further exploitation. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 This paper focusses on the potential for developing an interactive BIM environment that purposefully adopts generative design as a method of computational design for the early design stages. This research facilitates the automation of the conceptual architectural design process, using BIM as the central conduit for enhancing the integration of the whole building design process (including design interfaces).

By extending the model into the post-occupancy period, BIM models can be used to support Facilities Management and Building Operations, and offer a consolidated interface for information regarding all aspects of building operational performance. Four key challenges must be overcome to develop BIM models suitable for Sustainable Operations management: (1) identification of critical information required to inform Operational decisions, (3) the high level of effort to create new or modify existing BIM models for the building(s), (2) the management of information transfer between real-time operations and monitoring systems and the BIM model, and (4) the handling of uncertainty based on incomplete building documentation.

This is a major task for designers and those bodies that are charged with enforcing the building regulations. As a result this can often lead to ambiguity, inconsistency in assessments and delays in the overall construction process. As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry moves from 2D Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings to more semantically rich Building Information Models (BIMs), the development of automated compliance checking systems for building regulations becomes achievable. A format well suited to the automation of compliance checking is that based upon Industry Foundation Class (IFC). IFC has been accepted worldwide as an inter-operability standard. However, whether the IFC data format can fully support the specialised needs of the England and Wales Building Regulations is still debatable. In order to automate their checking, building regulations first need to be interpreted from human-readable free text rules into a set of computer-implementable rules.

Construction projects are characterized by the existence of a number of different co-building companies that together deliver a constructed product on site. The work tasks of all these different co-builders need to be aligned to allow for the efficient delivery of the product. To allow for smooth alignment, all co-builders work together in the planning phase to rule out unwanted conflicts between work activities. Despite these efforts, many projects still accrue costs forced by on-site conflicts that were not anticipated beforehand and require costly improvisation to be resolved. The potential of 4D CAD models to avoid costly on-site improvisation by providing possibilities to anticipate conflicts better in the planning phase has been widely acknowledged. However, little empirical evidence exists that illustrate these benefits.

Prefabrication could provide various benefits for housing production, including lower the cost, improve the management efficiency and quality, ensure the safety, and realize sustainability. However, to fully acquire these benefits in real world construction process, challenges still exist on real-time tracing and tracking of the prefabrication components, and getting real-time interactions among all the stockholders. Physical Internet (PI), as has been well adopted in logistics, could be an effective solution for real-time visibility. Based on the prefabrication practice in Hong Kong, this paper proposes the architecture of an PI-enabled prefabricated housing construction which upgrades and transforms the prefabrication construction so that the logistics echelons could be seamlessly integrated and synchronized, together with a PI-enabled decision support system (DSS) which uses Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud techniques for designing the architecture and a rich set of services and tools to assist different decision makers.. Firstly, three stages of prefabrication construction have been analyzed in detail to point out current challenges. Secondly, the technical framework of PI-enabled Building Information Modelling (BIM) Platform (PIBIMP) is developed. Finally, a case study is given to demonstrate the working process of our proposed solution, and the effectiveness of it has also been verified.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2345933563"}}

Accommodating the rapidly increasing senior population in the U.S. is a grand effort that necessitates sustainable solutions to address its social, economic and environmental impacts. From the building industry's standpoint, design for sustainable aging implies creating the physical and service environment that is resilient and adaptable to the needs associated with the aging process. The professional community has responded with well-conceived strategies such as universal and sustainable aging design. In practice, there is an inherent challenge in traditional paper-based design communication when professionals and clients have a hard time to understand each other at the desired level. Recent technological advancement in 3D modeling applications, exemplified by the prevalence of building information modelling (BIM), has reinvigorated sustainable aging design practices. Meanwhile, serious gaming has been gaining recognition as valuable enhancement to academic learning and professional training by effectively engaging participants with meaningful and programmable visualization and interaction. This study proposed to create a unique framework that leverages the integration of BIM and game engine to streamline and contextualize design communication in sustainable aging projects. A prototype framework, Design for Sustainable Aging (DfSA), was developed and discussed in this paper. Essentially, DfSA transforms a static design model into a robust 3D gaming environment wherein design information is preserved while user-centered and experience-based interactions with model components are achieved.

Furthermore, as-built BIM modelling for existing buildings is considered to be a time-consuming process in real projects.

This paper depicts a case study of the BIM (Building Information Modeling)enabled evaluation of design alternatives for an actual remodeling project in Yeongwol, Korea. The increase of urban population and income followed by the growth of economy has derived massive supply of grand scale housing project in Korea since 1970s. Consequently, building remodeling became one of the feasible resolutions for renovating such old housings in these days. This paper aims to introduce a technical approach to such remodeling projects based on BIMenabled applications focusing on quantitative analysis of design alternatives. Among the technical issues of such building remodeling projects, this paper focuses on the BIMenabled area analysis and comparison between design alternatives to support decisionmaking even in early phase of remodeling design process. BIM and its variety of applications have broadly influenced the domain of AECFM (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management) within the lifecycle of buildings. As one of the applications facilitated by BIM, the automated area calculation and scenariobased comparison between alternatives can play an important role in the early phase of remodeling project. We modeled three design alternatives (buildings) and three housing modules (units) based on the actual case in Yeongwol city, Korea using a BIM design authoring tool. Nine combinatorial BIM models were demonstrated for the BIMenabled review process described in this paper. To determine the most optimal design scenario among nine alternatives, this paper demonstrates a result of the conducted spatial program review. The main subject includes specific spatial program issues on; 1) the number of unit spaces; and 2) area of individual/grouped and private/shared spaces.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2263753284"}}

Today it is impossible to ignore the technological advances that are available in the construction industry, since they have developed innovative tools that facilitate and make the work in construction more efficient. One of these tools is BIM (Building Information Modeling) that is the process of generating and managing virtual data and information models that allow users involved integrate and reuse this information in the different stages of the life cycle of a building. This thesis consists in develop a BIM model of a building with certain characteristics and perform the steps of conception, design and estimation of time and costs in buildings using the software Revit, Robot Structural and Navisworks Manage of Autodesk, and show on a web page dynamic presentations and videos on using the software as well as the application of theoretical concepts of subjects of concrete design and construction programming, allowing students to learn and reinforce concepts integrating the BIM methodology outside the classroom.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2765327049"}}

BIM and its variety of applications have broadly influenced the domain of AEC-FM (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management) within the lifecycle of buildings. As one of the applications facilitated by BIM, the automated area calculation and scenario-based comparison between alternatives can play an important role in the early phase of remodeling project. We modeled design alternatives (buildings) and intended housing modules (units) based on the actual case in Yeongwol, Korea using a BIM design authoring tool. To determine the most optimal design scenario among nine alternatives, this paper demonstrates a result of the conducted spatial program review.

A construction site with zero accidents. So reads the vision concerning safety among many of the Swedish construction companies. Today the building trade is an industry with many accidents, and also the industry which has the most deaths per year. To get closer to the vision concerning zero accidents, work and development on many fronts is a necessity. One of these fronts could be the usage of BIM (building information modeling). Currently a rapid development towards using more and more 3D models with associated information is happening in the construction sector, these models with information is what BIM is all about. The main aim of this report is to get a closer look on how the construction companies Peab, NCC and Skanska uses BIM in general, and also how they use it in the area concerning work environment and safety. The study is based on a literature review, a meeting and interviews. The report starts with a chapter which describes basic laws and rules concerning work environment in general and safety on Swedish construction sites. Thereafter follows a chapter with facts about BIM, and at last there is a chapter which describes how the usage of BIM can be applied in the area of safety. Several BIM tools are processed in the report, among them are for example the possibility to make 3D layouts for the construction site, visualizations, coordination, modelling of safety equipment, automatic risk identification, virtual environments and info screens containing BIM illustrations. The study shows that the companies use the BIM tools to a certain extent, but also that this is an area of development. According to the interviewed the biggest challenge for introducing BIM in the area of safety is the old habits among people plus the unfamiliarity with technology, but if you listen to BIM coordinators and BIM responsible staff at Peab, NCC and Skanska, this is not an obstacle which can not be overcomed.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W937692873"}}

As the Korean government initiates the Han-style campaign, the efforts and expectations for the modernization and industrialization of Hanok are growing. Accordingly, a major R&D project sponsored by the government is in progress for the development of related technologies, in which the development of a Hanok design support system based on Building Information Modeling(BIM) technology is included as one of the major subjects. However, the development of design tools for Hanok so far has not focused on the windows and doors, which is another major element of Korean traditional architecture. Therefore, this study developed a BIM-based design tool for Hanok windows and doors as an approach to the integrated design of various Hanok elements and their applications to modern buildings. To this end, the characteristics of Hanok windows and doors were analyzed first in terms of the location, opening method, style, components, and the over-all construction. A design tool was then developed with the parametric modeling functions of the <TEX>$ArchiCAD^{(R)}$</TEX>system. The applicability and efficiency of the developed tool were verified with design simulations. This is expected to contribute to not only the application of Hanok windows and doors to modern buildings but also to the further development of an integrated Hanok design system.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2040336437"}}

The outcome of a housing design can be improved if various design options can rapidly be analysed to assist the client and architect in making informed decisions in the design process. Architects and clients will review in detail as an image, perspective, design drawings, presentation materials in a variety of forms, such as visualization to help you make the best decision. For architects and clients rational and efficient in order to make judgments and 3D simulations to form a visual effect that consensus, the BIM can be utilized as a decision making tool that can be easily understood by even non professionals.

Abstract Information technology is becoming a strong tool in different industries, including construction. The recent trend of buildings designing is leading up to creation of the most comprehensive virtual building model (Building Information Model) in order to solve all the problems relating to the project as early as in the designing phase. Building information modelling is a new way of approaching to the design of building projects documentation. Currently, the building site layout as a part of the building design documents has a very little support in the BIM environment. Recently, the research of designing the construction process conditions has centred on improvement of general practice in planning and on new approaches to construction site layout planning. The state of art in field of designing the construction process conditions indicated an unexplored problem related to connection of knowledge system with construction site facilities (CSF) layout through interactive modelling. The goal of the paper is to present the methodology for execution of 3D construction site facility allocation model (3D CSF-IAM), based on principles of parametric and interactive modelling.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1975044633"}}

This paper focuses on BIM-enabled modeling for the efficiency and comparative evaluation at the early stage of design process. The old-house problem has been brought up since 1970, because of Supply Grand scale Housing project in Korea. Old-house need \u2018Remodeling\u2019 approach to improve not only physical problems but also qualitative issues. In remodeling process, however, the problem of communication between workers, unstandardized design and construction process became additional problem. In this circumstance, there is need for efficiency and evaluation of building design quality. As an alternative, we apply BIM has become a topic issue in recent years in Architecture domain. It is a technology that manages and deals with all the information about the life cycle of a building. Focusing on the design quality review, and quality check, we aim to investigate the influence on the overall process of remodeling through the design model for the early stage of remodeling design.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2345444418"}}

These models can then be utilized or modified by individual members of the design team to aid in the selection of concept designs that appropriately meet client/design requirements. An Autodesk Revit plug-in application has been developed that enables the IVCGA solution to be transformed into a building information model in a common repository.

Since the new millennium, BIM has been widely adopted to improve productivity in the field of architecture, engineering, and construction with the government policies of each country. After its first introduction into the field of landscape architecture in USA, BIM has been debated on its merits and limitations mainly by the European countries' academic and, at the same time, practical worlds. However, little attention has been paid to BIM, in particular, in the field of landscape architecture in Korea leaving many issues to solve to fully utilize BIM. The purpose of this study is to present the main issues and strategic agenda for the successful introduction of BIM in landscape architecture in Korea. This study shows that the new derived word of LIM(Landscape Information Modeling) instead of BIM appeared in the field of landscape architecture. Then, this paper discusses the main issues on standardization and interoperability in the adoption of LIM to create, integrate, and reuse landscape information. Finally, four strategic agenda are presented to successfully introduce LIM into the domestic field of landscape architecture by reviewing the societies of the landscape discipline in UK and Norway that play a leading role by organizing BIM working groups.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2112860747"}}

This paper presents an analysis of the Building Information Modeling implementation process in architectural and industrial design companies in Belo Horizonte. A field research was conducted interviewing professionals from industrial design and architectural design companies. The analysis was based on companies\u2019 characteristics and tools used. Also, it was evaluated how implementation occurred, resulting benefits, challenges faced and designers perception of the process. A diversified BIM tools use was observed in different specialties on industrial design while on architectural design it was observed hegemony of tools. It was observed that the implementation of BIM, in the studied universe, is more developed in industrial design than in architectural design. Industrial design companies are already in the interoperability implementation stage, which is a higher BIM level than in architectural design companies. Architectural design companies are in the effort of leaving the traditional two-dimensional drawings towards parameterized 3D models. It was noted that industrial designers have a higher value perception regarding to parametric issues than architectural designers. Regarding of major reasons for adopting BIM, the perception of value among industrial designers and architectural designers is similar.The perceptions on the barriers to the adoption of BIM are basically antagonic for industrial and architectural designers. The most common way of software learning occurs through tutorials, forums and collaboration between peers. Among the proposed improvements presented by the interviewees it stands out the collaboration in team work and the commitment from the top management.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2527642799"}}

An often-introduced claim is that BIM can be a powerful tool for facility managers to improve buildings' performance and manage operations more efficiently throughout the life-cycle of buildings. Although this claim has been common since the early introduction of BIM, there is relatively little information about the real use on BIM in the operation and maintenance of buildings. Even most large public owners who have been early adopters of BIM (such as GSA, USACE or Senate Properties) have used BIM more in managing their construction projects than implementing it into their FM activities. The benefits of BIM for design and construction are relatively well studied and documented, but there is little evidence of the benefits of BIM in the operational phase. In addition, the challenges involved in shifting from traditional FM processes to new BIM-based processes are not well-known. In this paper, we document some of the issues involved in the adoption of BIM in FM and identify some of the enablers and barriers to BIM implementation in FM. The findings are based on a case study carried out during the final design and construction phase of Manchester Town Hall Complex, a major re-development project in the UK. Results confirm the lack of awareness of the potential of BIM in the operation phase and the need for clear guidelines for the implementation of BIM in FM defining required level of integration, standard BIM protocols and the key deliverables for FM purposes.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2169576423"}}

In order to apply \u2018BIM-technology\u2019 in developing design variations of prefabricated modular buildings, a parametric model of basic system was defined and its offspring alternatives were generated. An information structure was designed first facilitate the interoperation between design or analysis software. Secondly, the performance-oriented design process was divided into four design steps such as generation of alternatives (1st), alternatives analysis(1st), generation of alternatives(2nd), alternatives analysis and optimization(2nd). It is based on \u2018after-the-fact\u2019 compared to \u2018before-the-fact\u2019 approach. Finally, a data exchange process was implemented to enhance the BIM usability since we need to change enormous BIM data to simplified one for modeling\u2019s use purpose. This research is related with performance-oriented design process using BIM. It will contribute to create more variation types of prefabricated modular housings and improve integrated quality of this system by using collaborative software.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1901793699"}}

While BIM processes are established for new buildings, the majority of existing buildings is not maintained, refurbished or deconstructed with BIM yet. Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research, involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings.

The building industry uses numerous engineering standards, building codes, specifications, and regulations (henceforth, all are referred to as \u201cregulations\u201d for the purposes of brevity), and a diverse set of industry vocabularies to describe, assess, and deliver constructed facilities. These building regulations are available as hardcopy and searchable digital documents. Some building design software applications (e.g., building-energy analysis and fire-egress assessment) are available that include computer-interpretable representations of the logic and rules from relevant building regulations. As part of the expanding use of building information modeling and new types of software applications, building and regulatory stakeholders and their software suppliers are recognizing the value of combining building models with rule sets for multidomain analyses, optimization, and assessing regulatory compliance. The availability of validated representations of building regulations for use by model-checking applications will streamline and shorten the building process, reduce inefficiencies and errors in the process, and enable new capabilities for optimizing designs and for automating the regulations-compliance assessment process. There has been a significant amount of research on this topic, and some of these results have been published in this journal during the past three decades. There are now a number of very important initiatives [e.g., by Associated General Contractors of America (AGC); American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC); American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE); Fiatech: Industry Consortium to Advance Innovation (ICAI); International Code Council (ICC); National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS); and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)] to develop standardized representational approaches for building regulations so that they can be applied and checked automatically against building information models and standardized data-exchange representations, such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs). Numerous fields of engineering, particularly those that rely on interdisciplinary collaboration, are adopting vocabulary-management and ontologydevelopment software tools as part of the process of transitioning to computer-interpretable standards for engineering. Buildingsystems engineering, sustainable manufacturing (Lechevalier et al. 2013), and biomedical engineering are using these semantic tools to develop the needed infrastructure for a new generation of computer-interpretable engineering standards. With this editorial, we provide recommendations for broadening the support and coordination of these initiatives, which are needed and timely, and present a set of issues derived from research and prototyping that is related to development and industry deployment of formal computable representations of building regulations.

The way that space is being perceived during the building design stage affects the way it is delivered. This becomes more complex when considering not only the geometric view of space, but also the building as a whole with all its uses. It is recognised that different users have different needs particularly as regards their use of space. It is proposed that building information modelling (BIM) can accommodate different perspectives on space held by the building design team, facility management team and building occupants. This paper investigates various views on the way that space is perceived from different perspectives. Data have been attained from a university building under construction in the United Kingdom using interviews with the building design team, and questionnaires with the facility management team and building occupants. The collected data demonstrate the complexity of space including the effect of 2D and 3D views on perceptions. The paper concludes with highlighting these different perspectives emphasizing the need for collaboration. Further work is needed to explore different space algorithms, which can accommodate these different perspectives in the BIM model.

BIM is a technology that uses parametric \u2022 modeling to minimize the time spent in coordination of design details like locating and moving architectural elements and the  corresponding required documentation changes. It also has the added benefit of allowing the entirety of design development to occur in three dimensions possibly leading to better quality designs and enabling timely creation of realistic renderings. It allows greater control of document information, such as schedules, and can produce and manage information like occupancy plans for use in the long term facility management process. Currently, the facility delivery process remains fragmented and it depend on paper-based modes of communication. Errors and omissions in paper documents often cause unanticipated field costs, delays and eventual lawsuits between the various parties in a project team. In using CAD, we are essentially drawing the same way we did on paper - in two dimensions. The only difference is that now the drawings are electronic and easier to manipulate and reproduce. We can move entire walls with a few clicks of the mouse where as on paper the entire sheet had to be redrawn. This drastically speeds up the process but also creates some challenges as well. One of the common problems associated with 2D- based communication during the design phase is the considerable time and expense required to generate critical assessment information about a proposed design, including cost estimates, energy use analysis, and structural details. So BIM is the new thing can solve these problems. The Objectives of this study are to explore, appraise and synthesize relevant literature with specific focus on BIM's process flow and develop 3D parametric model, to test the BIM's process flow and develop 3D parametric model using Revit Software. The 3D parametric model helps different parties to better understand the style, especially details of the design. 3D parametric modeling facilitates the design of substantial and intricate models with 3D however impose a mode of modeling and also planning. The ability to extract geometric and also property information from a building model easy use in design, investigation, construction planning or with operations. Using walkthrough tool, it allow visualizing inside the building and it helps to check error inside the building. So with these 3D parametric modeling hopes it can help to solve problems before and during the early phases of design and save time of the project.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2230508957"}}

A field research was conducted interviewing professionals from industrial design and architectural design companies. The analysis was based on companies\u2019 characteristics and tools used. Also, it was evaluated how implementation occurred, resulting benefits, challenges faced and designers perception of the process. A diversified BIM tools use was observed in different specialties on industrial design while on architectural design it was observed hegemony of tools. It was observed that the implementation of BIM, in the studied universe, is more developed in industrial design than in architectural design. Industrial design companies are already in the interoperability implementation stage, which is a higher BIM level than in architectural design companies. Architectural design companies are in the effort of leaving the traditional two-dimensional drawings towards parameterized 3D models. It was noted that industrial designers have a higher value perception regarding to parametric issues than architectural designers. Regarding of major reasons for adopting BIM, the perception of value among industrial designers and architectural designers is similar.The perceptions on the barriers to the adoption of BIM are basically antagonic for industrial and architectural designers. The most common way of software learning occurs through tutorials, forums and collaboration between peers.

Purpose: This paper will review the value of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and demonstrate how the early integration of Facilities Management (FM) within BIM can enhance building performance from the perspectives of the building delivery team, facilities management team and building occupants. Background: It is proposed that involvement of the facility management team at an early design stage can contribute towards enhancing building performance, but this requires a multiple perspective of FM to be adopted. BIM has the potential to be used for managing facilities as it provides extensive information about all physical assets in the building. Approach: Pilot data has been acquired from a newly built and operated university building in the United Kingdom using interviews to capture information from these different perspectives. Results: The differences in perspectives are presented based on the responses collected from the interviews. Three parameters are used to compare and analyse them highlighting how these differences are difficult to accommodate in building design Practical implications: The paper proposes a structure for BIM to accommodate the different perspectives on FM from the building design stage. This leads to the necessity of involving the facility management team during the design and construction process. Research limitations: The proposed structure is based on the responses from the interviews, and may apply to other educational buildings, but may not be generalised to all buildings.

As a result, the aseismatic capacity of building structures, especially their capacity to prevent collapse, is of great importance to the overall earthquake defense system of the society. During the long term of research, some researchers have provided several excellent ideas. However, on account of lacking of the data summarization, a great many of studies have been stagnant.

Digital technology in the field of construction The irrepressible rise of digital technology has been felt across all industries. Yet, of all the places digital technology would not be expected to be found, none is perhaps more surprising than in construction. Nonetheless, that is exactly what has happened. Today's construction industry is au fait with using cloud services, big data and laser scanners to achieve unprecedented efficiencies and capabilities in data usage. At the same time, Building Information Modeling (BIM) has brought changes in production and consumption of data, with Cross Industry Innovation 3D printing technology influencing data customization and beyond. It was BIM which first ushered in a sea change in the way digital technology is applied in the field of construction. Planned innovation that was led by the public sector is now affecting the private sector and is already widely expected to be hailed as iconic. The next stage in the popularization of digital technology in construction was the need to find ways to make use of the large volumes of data being created. Cloud computing makes this possible, enabling the update and use of data required right at the site using smart devices. Alongside BIM and cloud computing, the third pillar of digital technology in construction is the use of 3D printing technology, which has been used as a means to attain cost-savings. Now, with BIMbased 3D printing, a new era in producing building model has officially come of age. Indeed, today's construction business uses many digital technologies, yet interestingly the scope of their application continues to widen in line with demand and the increasing need for full-sized model production made feasible through cost-affordable 3D printing technology. 3D printing technology cannot make a model by itself. Then, what else is needed for user-customized production? 123D is the generic term for the free production software programs provided by Autodesk. With 123D, both experts and non-experts can design and produce at ease using 3D models and output devices. Of course, with the figures and sketch tools provided by 123D Design, it is possible to make a 3D design. Yet, by reading an *.SAT file created in 123D Design with Autodesk Revit, which is a BIM tool, it is even possible to make any necessary modifications and then print the building model created using a 3D printer. Plus, an *.STL file can be exported provided that the Autodesk Revit add-in program named STL Exporter is installed. Though it is not yet used widely in the field, it is still effective as a way to check and investigate aspects of the whole-project model and its main parts. The construction market is now such that the use, application and consumption of data hold arguably as much sway as data creation and/or production. Moreover, new technologies, particularly those that are becoming increasingly affordable, are enabling the better use of data. Such changes, rather than causing conflicts between long-standing industry domains are in fact heightening expectations of a new market in which participants are able to better cooperate and succeed alongside each other.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2796078975"}}

This thesis is about \u201dBIM  , it addresses the problems and risks associated with the introduction in Sweden and how the expression is misinterpreted. The work also includes how BIM should be used to achieve profitability and how the different operators relate to it. The Swedish construction industry is today exposed with big problems when it comes to productivity, efficiency, material waste and a variety of other factors. They are searching for solutions to these problems, and the answer to some of these might just be BIM. BIM is still a relatively new approach, where the concept is all about reuse and smart ways to manage information through various stages. This is then often visualized in one or a few 3D models, instead of traditional engineering where it is made up by many drawings, thereby contributing among other things to a greater understanding to those involved in the projects. The thesis is based on an analysis of the results, that have been obtained by a literature review and ten interviews with people from different stages and stakeholders in the industry, which have all in one way or another, been working with BIM . The result intends to create a greater understanding of this complex concept and a possibility to be used as a complement when using BIM, where it can give a hint on how a project should be profitable and how common mistakes can be avoided. After analyzing the information given by the work, the answers to the following questions are responded to in the conclusion: - difficulties are there in introducing BIM in the rail project? - benefits can be achieved through the use of BIM in the railway project and who will use them? - In what kind of rail projects is BIM profitable?

During the last years, the development within the building industry has focused more and more on BIM, Building Information Modelling. The trade has under a long time been criticised for its lack of effectiveness and quality where BIM has seemed as the solution by many people. The standardisation of the work process hasn\u2019t yet been done within Sweden which by now has led to us being far behind the leading countries in the particular field. In later years the work process has been going towards a more common structure with standards, demands and guidelines and we stand to be introduced to a future within the building industry with new possibilities and problems. A so called moment 22 is common to occur, where the consultant doesn\u2019t know exactly what the client wants and at the same time the client doesn\u2019t know exactly what he could have delivered. This bachelor thesis aims to investigate if the actors in the building industry are fully satisfied with the BIM delivered by the construction designer within small to medium sized projects. In larger and more advanced projects the projection nowadays is often made entirely in BIM, while in smaller projects not so often. The study was completed through three interviews and two observations that make the foundation for the presented results. From the study it was made clear that the lack of structured client demands, inexperience and lack of knowledge plays a big part in this problem. A number of suggestions and ideas on what information and level that is of interest and would develop the construction designers BIM-delivery is presented in the result of the thesis.

BIM has been a trend in recent years when it comes to design and construction ofnew buildings. However, there has been less talk about what happens to BIM modelsafter the construction phase.This issue has been raised at the Forsmark construction documentation department.This thesis aims to look at how the information in a BIM model can be transferred tofacility management and GIS systems and thus add value, even after the constructionphase.Questions raises how such an exchange might look like and whether it is reliable.How should a claim be brought to planners for such an exchange to work.This thesis tested some of the most common methods for this kind of exchange ofinformation from BIM models to facility management and GIS. It was formats like IFC,Fi2xml and a database connectivity that was analyzed by a computer simulation of amodel provided by Forsmark. The model consisted of an existing office building atForsmark, modeled in Autodesk Revit.The results indicate that the formats tested require a precise plotting of the models.The loss of information that came to light in the simulation could be attributed tofailure modeling in Revit. Even such things as naming of areas must be consistent. Toachieve more efficient naming process, test where carried out to deal withparameters outside the Revit environment. However, it did not work optimally.Support for some parameters was lost and the information that was built up in thedatabase was too extensive.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W303400308"}}

Recent growth in construction volume is leading The University of Alabama to identify areas for improvement in the construction process. Change orders have a significant impact on project cost and schedule; therefore they are in need of improvement. Researchers have worked on improving the change order management and prevention plan and implementing it into their construction management. With the implementation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) for the design and construction of new facilities new research is necessary in order to determine the impact of BIM on the change order management and prevention strategy. The University of Alabama recently completed the construction of two similar engineering facilities, The South and North Engineering Research Centers (SERC and NERC), designed for labs and classrooms. The first building is designed and built using 2-Dimension modeling while the second building is designed and built using BIM for 3-Dimension modeling and coordination. Change orders due to design errors/omissions are noted as preventable, and the main focus of the research. Pertinent information was extracted and analyzed when reviewing change orders from both SERC and NERC. Change orders due to design errors/omissions diminish from 45 on SERC to 9 on NERC. The change in the project cost due to change orders from design errors/omissions decreased from 0.54% on SERC to 0.18% on NERC. Researchers found that BIM is not the only contributing factor in change order reduction.

Recently, BIM focused on architectural design is actively studied for an efficient construction management. BIM is widely spread on domestic construction industries by the introduction and encouragement of Korean government since 2010. This system can be used to get over difficulties to express complicated building designs by 2D CAD design in response to a bigger and more complex building design trend, and it makes good use as a quick communication tool among each construction stakeholder in the initial planning and executing phases of construction project. BIM technique enables to help understand design concepts more quickly by showing each component of building visually such as spaces and shapes by 3D modeling, and to manage in the integrated-system by assigning material, schedule and cost for each space of the building. Therefore, BIM can be widely utilized such as construction project integrated-information management system. Meanwhile, the current high-rise building design trend has been applied with an asymmetrical structure and geometric shape, state-of-the-art facilities as well as various control technology to operate them effectively. Notwithstanding the fast changes of high-rise building in shape and structure as well as the fast development of technology, the development of project management system is not enough to keep up. Therefore, application of BIM which is the collectivity of the most advanced system can be a great alternative with the purpose of successful and efficient construction project management of the high-rise building as an integrated construction management system. This study is focused on the performed method to conduct and facilitate construction management tasks based on the BIM modeling technology by using 4D simulation on the RC works of high-rise building.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2883042721"}}

Many countries around the world are responding to this paradigm shift including the United Kingdom (UK). The Cabinet office took the decision in 2011 to make the use of collaborative 3D BIM technology mandatory for all public sector construction contracts by 2016 (Cabinet Office, 2011). According to Smith and Tardif, despite certain myths and misconceptions surrounding BIM, its rate of implementation has been much faster in comparison to the availability of professionals skilled in use of BIM, thus creating a skill gap in the design and construction industry (Smith and Tardif, cited in Barison and Santos, 2010a). This article aims at bridging the gap between the graduate skill sets and the changing needs of the profession. The research methodology adopted consists of thoroughly reviewing the existing literature in this subject area coupled with carrying out a survey of accredited Schools of Architecture in the UK.

A plenary session dedicated to industrial speakers was held on the second day of the conference. The session presented future plans and aspirations from the point of views of construction and software companies. The other 45 sessions covered the breadth and depth of computing in engineering, including advances in information technologies and novelty in applications. One possible grouping of the paper contributions can be as follows: simulation and automation (65 papers); information modeling and knowledge management (35 papers); construction and management (46 papers); design support and architecture and planning (47 papers); evolutionary and adaptive methods (15 papers); infrastructure monitoring, maintenance, and management and active control of structures (16 papers); computational mechanics (50 papers); and engineering education (24 papers). The proceedings cover advances and innovations in information technologies as applied to engineering problems. They also include new approaches and methodologies to tackle engineering problems and provide insightful looks at the challenges and the information needs of the future. The proceedings include considerable focus on information modeling for ever-more digital representation of the world encompassing more aspects and more complex domains, life-cycle and sustainability issues responding to the global climate challenges, and automation in construction for improved accuracy and productivity. The contributions at the conference proposed future directions and challenges related to computing in civil and building engineering. These included better exploitation of digital information modeling and extending the standardized product and process modeling technologies; improving decision-support capabilities and decision-implication analysis through integrating wider aspects of the problem space; embedding optimization techniques more holistically; and integrating all of these by making more use of virtualization in an attempt to simplify the use of the output technologies. It could be argued that the high-level directions and challenges previously mentioned are not very different from those that could have been predicted many years ago.

Abstract Background Nowadays, the use of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) systems is effective for monitoring traffic, preventing crime, and ensuring safety in many public spaces. However, the effectiveness of CCTV coverage is often achieved through design experience and trial-and-error, instead of being evaluated and visualized using a robust approach. Methods Firstly, a method for simulating varifocal CCTV lenses in order to attain different fields of view was developed, allowing real CCTV views to be approximated by adjusting the parametric properties of simulated CCTV cameras in the 3D BIM model. Secondly, an API (Application Programming Interface) plug-in program for a commercially available BIM tool was developed to facilitate the parametric modeling of CCTV systems and the evaluation of the CCTV coverage. Results A complete BIM model of an MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) station was chosen as a case study to apply the developed approach to the examination of CCTV coverage. Finally, the overall coverage of the CCTV systems for the MRT station were demonstrated visually and studied in the station's BIM model. Conclusions This research has developed a robust visualization approach for evaluating the coverage of CCTV systems in public building spaces.

BIM supports the many useful functions to develop the AEC industries, such as quantity takeoff and cost estimating, clash detection, schedule simulation, etc. However, the most important factor to determine the practical usefulness is the connectivity for traditional way. In this paper, we analyzed the work efficiency of BIM based structural drawing in terms of drawing workability, graphic expressivity, clash detection and working hours in comparison with those of 2D based structural drawing. And we proposed the division of works between BIM based and 2D based structural drawing for efficient work in field. For this, we investigated the real project as a test bed, that is, 20-floor ground and 1-floor underground scale wall-type apartment comprised of 4-plan type, 5-household. As a results, we found out the difference of expression in case of centerline and wall, and BIM based work requires more working time than 2D based work because it spends time to retouch BIM generated drawing into traditional form and generate initial BIM model itself. To activate BIM in field, it is needed to improve the traditional working environment of structural drawing forms and establish a BIM based drawing standard soon.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1547654913"}}

Prefabrication is a form of industrialization that transfers some stages of the construction project from fields to an off-site production facility. The most widely used form of prefabrication in construction is the use of prefabricated individual building elements in which a particular part or form is repeated many times. However, the benefits to the construction project may be increased by moving beyond prefabrication of individual building elements toward configuring a higher level of prefabrication. In this paper, an industry foundation class (IFC)\u2013based system is developed to configure groupings of precast elements for a prefabricated building to minimize the total number of components so as to reduce the production, transportation, and installation cost. The framework uses three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) software that is compatible with IFC. Geometrical and topological relationships of elements are extracted from IFC and modeled as a graph data model (GDM). The system performs analysis on the graph model based on the attributes of the building elements to generate all possible configurations for precasting. Constructability rules are applied to reduce the solutions to feasible configurations. The functionality of the developed framework is verified by considering an illustrative example of a residential building. Results showed that applying the new configurations of precast components can contribute up to 15% reduction in the total cost compared with the traditional elemental approach.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2125532550"}}

The notion of advancing levels of adequate regulatory compliance within the domain of construction and engineering is by no means a new phenomenon. An extensive degree of effort has over a number of decades previously focused on semi/fully automating design checking against regulatory building codes. After experiencing somewhat of a dip in popularity within academia, this research topic is once again of great interest due to the on-going adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) within the construction domain among other drivers like frequent updates to building regulatory documents particularly in relation to sustainability related issues like energy efficiency of buildings. This interest will only increase as we witness further widespread adoption of this new BIM paradigm across until now untouched disciplines. Unfortunately design checking within the remit of BIM still faces major problems with respect to national and local regulations as no sustainably sensible or scalable method has yet been implemented to ensure compliance rules are consistent with current legislation within these contexts. This work questions a suitable representational data format for UK construction and engineering regulations focusing on machine processable formats built entirely on open data standards which can then set the basis for addressing the aforementioned issues. We compare two existing legislation data models, namely the Crown Legislation Markup Language (CLML) and Akoma Ntoso, whilst in the process grading each on its suitability for most accurately accommodating and expressing the domain and profession specific nature of typical building regulations. The study conclusions indicate that the design, management and current availability of the CLML has resulted in a scenario where barriers exist to widespread adoption, this includes building out community in support of the language. Akoma Ntoso on the other hand has focused on building community around the proposed standard.

Whilst the application of BIM continues to be acknowledged and prevailing, design practitioners and academics find themselves in a paradox with an on-going discussion on the impact of BIM tools on design creativity and innovation. Literature suggests that BIM tools can hinder design creativity due to: parametric limitations; interoperability; and the demand for detailed information at preliminary design stages. However, other literature shows that BIM tools increase design creativity, and at some point provide limitless opportunities to be creative. The aim of this paper is to identify and verify the impact of BIM tools on design creativity. It is important for architectural students and practioners to be aware of the impact of BIM tools on the design. A literature review was used to identify the benefits and constraints of BIM tools on design creativity; a questionnaire survey was used to verify its impact.

Offsite construction has also seen significant development in the building sector in the past decade; in infrastructure however, offsite exploitation has been more limited. This paper presents research regarding how innovation initiatives such as BIM and offsite can and need to be considered together, thus allowing leaner design, a greater integration of lifetime project data and more novel technical solutions. The analysis outlines the benefits of utilising offsite within a BIM environment, the challenges currently facing the supply chain, and recommendations are made as to how best to implement the emergent benefits.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W217444153"}}

Over 2,000 commercial and industrial projects representing over a billion square feet of federal, state, and private construction in the United States, as well as in other countries, are in the process of incorporating Building Information Modeling. The cost to build with Building Information Modeling can range from 10% to 25% more, depending on the involvement in design and construction variables, including the training. Since owners see a cost benefit, they are increasingly using Building Information Modeling. Therefore, university programs must update their students in this technology. This paper examines the factors that influence an owner\u2019s decision. This includes enhancing the project\u2019s coordination, addressing conflicts which reduce change orders, improving communications, and establishing a cost budget that can be better administered. The paper will also discuss the relationship between the Building Information Modeling industry and university construction programs, especially Penn State Harrisburg. This relationship results in the students becoming more aware of Building Information Modeling, its transformation and the opportunities for them. This partnering has resulted in an excellent relationship with industry and the construction program in educating its students in a rapidly changing technology.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2188586423"}}

AbstractThe purpose of this thesis is to give an overall picture of what BIM is and how the method of working can influence the building process positively. The report focuses on the road construction industry, primarily from a projector's perspective. A design example will also show how a model can be created by using software that supports workflows in BIM.BIM can be abbreviation for BuildingInformationModel, for this case it refers to the model or models and is a digital object-based representation of a building or facility. It can also be abbreviation for BuildingInformationModeling, it then refers to a way of working, i.e. process of creating and using one or several building information models in the construction or facility process.By using BIM there are many benefits, not only in the house construction but also in the road construction industry. The coordination would be considerably easier and of better quality. With the help of a coordination model it would for example possible to perform collisions checks to detect conflict between different technologies. In a complete model there is also material that the entrepreneur can use for e.g. machine control.The model is created in Autodesk Civil 3D with the add Naviate Road. I started by first establishing a terrain model over the existing ground. After that I designed an alignment, a profile and a normal section of the road, which together form a road corridor. The terrain model and the road corridor constitute a 3D model where different design options can be evaluated.The often missing demands for BIM from clients are a problem. Establishing BIM models can result in higher project costs and unfortunately some clients cannot see the benefits of these models. If the client instead would invest more money in a well-established model, costs can be reduced in the production and the management which would lead to decreased in total cost. The knowledge to maintain the BIM model needs to be improved in the management stage. If the model is maintained and used properly, it is an excellent information base, not least as material for future changes.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W426801543"}}

During autumn 2010 the company Titania purchased the software Revit in order to be able to have the possibility to utilize the work process of BIM in their renovation projects.A transition from 2D-projection has not yet been completed since the general opinion within the company is that the projects contain complex works in production and therefore must be solved on site. Currently Titania markets their renovated penthouses when they are finished but they aim to sell the projects at an earlier stage. In order to realise this, it is necessary for the company to be able to provide more material to their broker which they can present to the clients.The purpose of this work is to investigate and examine the differences that BIM could generate for the production, and how BIM can be implemented in the workplace and also to show how Titania can use BIM in sales and marketing of their projects. The work is based on a case study, interviews and literature study regarding the project Byggmastaren, a project for renovation of attics in Solna.During the work with our case study we encountered some problems in the current way of working, examples are; discrepancies between drawings, conflicts between building elements, dimensions that do not match each other. This is something that is also noticed in our interview with the Site manager for Byggmastaren, those problems can ultimately lead to difficulties in the actual production. In the case study, we also investigated what was missing in the existing material in order to support and promote the sales of the apartments, what emerged were; the degree of light in the apartments and clearer visualization.In our result we introduced features in BIM that might be alternative solutions to the problems we discovered and requests that were made. The conclusion of our thesis is that Titania should use BIM as a tool in their planning. This may as well increase the quality of the materials supplied to production and thus save time.BIM could also provide an opportunity to visualize the project with images and 3D-models, which can be used by the broker to bring sales forward.A summary of what we ourselves noticed during our own work combined with acquired information are presented as a simplified process for how BIM can be implemented across the company.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W588405005"}}

Forsmarks Kraftgrupp, owner of Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, is facing both restoration work in the plant and construction of offices, a workshop and a hotel. BIM now appears as an effective method to reduce expenses but also to further bring order and structure to the volumes of documentation that has accumulated during more than thirty years of operation.The purpose of this bachelor thesis is to provide a basis for implementing BIM at the structural engineering department at the Forsmark plant and to promote BIM to the rest of the organization. The objective is to visualize the usefulness of BIM at the Forsmark plant, specifically in property management. Interviews, a laboratory experiment, and an analysis of the routines at the Forsmark plant were chosen as empirical methodology.Since the Forsmark plant consists of an extensive amount of buildings, a consensus is required regarding how BIM models for operations and facility management should be designed and managed. Currently, Autodesk AutoCAD\u2122 is used and multiple 3D-models have already been produced. However, the ambition is to switch to Autodesk Revit\u2122 in the near future. This thesis shows that an export of a 3D-model from AutoCAD\u2122 to Revit\u2122 is time-consuming, but achievable if required.To employ the full capacity of BIM, it is vital to develop a requirements specification early on in the building project. Among other things, the specification should define the requirements of the BIM-model for the purpose of using building information during operations and management. The specification should especially address the level of design and detail.The interviews with purchasers at the Forsmark plant showed that BIM is a foreign concept in other departments of the organization. Currently, it\u2019s difficult to say in which way the BIM-models would facilitate the work of operations and maintenance staff. Furthermore, implementation of new practices at the Forsmark plant is a lengthy process, due to the safety requirements. However, great gains are possible when using BIM in operations and management. In particular, the task of updating existing documentation is simplified when a modification only has to be made at one point, instead of multiple drawings.Moreover, both the structural engineering department and the purchasers that were interviewed are in favour of a possible BIM pilot project. A pilot project could be used as a future reference to gain backing in other departments of Forsmark Kraftgrupp.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W620583599"}}

The current architectural design of unit modular has been based on 2D of CAD program, so unit modular character which needs unit information management, as a dried-member system, has no effect on design process. The purpose of this study is We have developed a suitable BIM design process, according to various works of construction, then tried to contribute to supply and activation of the urban-life-housing based on unit modular. The BIM modeling process based on unit modular has been in order of unit combination with preparing manual classification, and, it has been constructed, at construction site, from housing foundation to roof finish by Bottom-up method. At a manufacturing factory, it has been produced in order of 1) grouping materials and parts, 2) fabricating unit boxes, and 3) interference examination of unit boxes, and each order has been classified as housing structure, architecture, plumbing process separately. At a construction site, the fabrication has been done in order of, like as a real housing construction scenario, 1) RC foundation work 2) unit module job-site-fabrication work, 3) roof truss work, 4) plumbing and HVAC work, and 5) housing interior finish work. After modeling process, the interference examination on each work of construction has finally completed modeling. The Unit modular utilizing BIM modeling can make easy housing maintenance through systematic control with preparing manual of unit module information, and securing accurate and speedy construction information.

Building Information Modeling and architecture, more commonly known as BIM is the subject of many discussions in the architectural communities lately. The architectural design is a complex set of transactions where the knowledge of many disciplines meets the professionalism of people involved, however most of the interaction is done on paper-based communication. Building Information Modeling, the subject of this paper, is a design strategy which aspires to be much more than a mere information exchange tool: it is rather a coordinated and holistic approach aimed to assist designer, engineers, developers, decision makers, contractors and owners. A digital model derived from B.I.M. (acronym for Building Information Modeling) software allows, among other features, the integration of the necessary data to all the participants of the project. It maintains and shares up to date information, facilitates the changes of the building components in real time and describes the project in a coherent way. Aggregating the information is the very essence of B.I.M., where sorting and the semantics of the building components are combined into a multidisciplinary interactive archive. The NIBS (National Institute of Building Science) defines B.I.M as \"a representation of digital physical characteristics and functional properties of an object\u2016.

As there has been a growing concern about environmental problems, ecological concepts apply for green growth in the field of architecture. Thereupon, the demand and interest for the Korean Traditional House known as typical of environment-friendly houses increased. There are lots of difficulties in applying the Korean Traditional House to design and construction phases, because of the lack of experts and data to support the demand. To solve these problems, a system for construction and dissemination of information about the Korean Traditional House is required. Throughout applying an Open BIM to the Korean Traditional House, this paper focuses on the requirements and a standardized system for effective utilization of information. In addition, the authors propose a framework including the integrated information system which will utilize and further disseminate the information. The application of an Open BIM-based system helps increase interoperability among heterogeneous BIM tools. Also, the standardized system makes it possible to define standard elements.

BIM is about virtual design and is based on all consultancy groups in the design team modeling in 3D. Intelligent objects and metadata, such as price and material, are used. The project group has a common interchange format for simple sharing of information. To get an idea of how the situation with BIM for landscape architects looks like today, I collected information mostly through interviews. Landscape architects, clients and contractors were interviewed. Today there is some uncertainty in the industry around which BIM software to use as a landscape architect and there are no obvious choices. To provide an overview of the software situation, I made a compilation of the software mentioned by my respondents. The discussion revolves around how the work process of landscape architects is affected when working in 3D and BIM, and how that process can be improved.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W168467599"}}

The Irish State in recent years has suffered huge financial losses in the public works sector, which has now pushed the Irish Government to explore new ways of controlling cost. This background lead to the introduction of the Capital Works Management Framework in 2007 which aimed to support the certainty of outcome in terms of cost and quality, as well as improved risk management, through the implementation of fixed price contracts. In order to successfully compete within this framework it is recommended by the authors, that Irish Government moves towards the legal mandating of BIM. This can ensure a greater cost certainty for the Irish Government on recent investments that include a \u20ac1.5 billion programme to provide new schools across the country. In an attempt to promote BIM within Ireland a recent pilot workshop and a further ten BIM workshops where commissioned, in which served as the main primary research tool for this paper. Despite the success of these workshops, Ireland is still a long way from embracing BIM and would require the commissioning of a pilot project, from a sceptical Irish Government, to see its true value. In order for the Irish Government to successfully guarantee a more reliable method of cost certainty and greater value, it is recommended by the authors, that the Irish Government move towards the mandatory use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) on public works projects by following a similar methodology to that adopted in the UK. There is a plan for a phased five-year development within the UK that public works projects will be required to use BIM techniques from 2016. This plan was devised around a hypothesis which defined a scenario in which the Government client would have an estate that was smarter and better equipped to face a low carbon economy, with associated reductions in delivery and carbon emissions. This paper will set about investigation how BIM can address the following specific goals of the CWMF, namely: \uf0b7 Move towards greater cost certainty at contract award stage and ensure, as far as practicable, that the accepted tender prices and the final cost are the same. \uf0b7 Award contracts on the basis of a lump-sum fixed-price to the greatest extent possible. \uf0b7 Rebalance risk, so that there is optimal allocation of risk. \uf0b7 Achieve value for money. \uf0b7 Achieve more efficient delivery of the projects.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W129087132"}}

Purpose Due to the rapid development of cities, underground structures, such as deep excavations and tunnels have been widely used to increase underground space. Since these underground structures are often adopted in old and crowded town area, accidents may easily do serious damage to adjacent structure and even cause some casualties. Professional engineering knowledge and experience can reduce or avoid this chain of events. But it is undeniably the case that in more complex urban engineering environments, risks are higher. Construction project teams must therefore consider a wide variety of information when managing risks and making project decisions. Urban deep excavation construction might cause unfavourable effects on the ground and to nearby structures. Environmental impacts need to be evaluated and monitored during the deep excavation construction. Generally, construction project teams will set up monitoring instruments to control and monitor overall environmental status, especially when retaining wall construction, retaining wall excavation, and during groundwater pumping. Voluminous monitoring data and project information are usually created along the delivery processes of construction. It is difficult to view and manage them comprehensively. Method Our research employs the concept of building information modelling (BIM) in environmental impact assessment for urban deep excavation projects. BIM is a relatively new technology that facilitates better information integration and management. Many engineering companies employ BIM for information integration, visualization, and parametric design, to reduce both the duplication of work and the complexity of interface integration. In this research, a 3D-building model, an excavation model, environmental conditions, the results of ground surface settlement analysis, and measurement and monitoring data, were integrated into our system to assist construction project teams to execute environmental impact assessment accurately. The risks and issues affecting safety of excavation and nearby structures might be recognized earlier through conveying information visually in this system. Construction project teams can then handle them immediately. The implementation of the system was carried out in the MicroStation Visual Basic for Applications (MVBA) environment. The Bentley MicroStation supports visualization of the 3D-model and provides some capabilities for 3D-object manipulation and information query. Results & Discussion This system can provide construction project teams a full view of the ongoing project, along with functions to integrate and display information multidimensionally.

Purpose The recent research trend of building information modelling (BIM) involves interoperability and issues pertaining to the design, construction, operations, and maintenance phases of a building. However, few researchers are concerned with problems encountered in the last two phases of the building life cycle. Since BIM has been widely used in the design and construction phases, further expanding the BIM data stream to the post-construction phase can not only establish a consistent, shared database for information exchange between the phases but assist in current facility management applications. This research reconceptualises BIM with object-oriented thoughts to a space-based representation, and tries to construct an interface between BIM and existing facility management software. Method Model-driven architecture (MDA) is one of the modern software design approaches. With its foundation \u2013 meta-object facility (MOF) \u2013 and model transformation, MDA provides an ideal solution for easily maintaining the interoperability. In this research, a MOF of a building is constructed by imitating the MDA approach, encapsulating BIM data and providing an interface for external facility management software. This MOF of a building is designed with spatial interference due to the maintenance and repair work is usually based on the space.

Freeform architecture is thus designed and constructed differently from formal buildings. In order to more easily and inexpensively actualize freeform architecture, Building Information Modeling (hereinafter referred to as BIM) has recently been applied in the construction industry. However, the related research and case analyses are not sufficient to identify the implications and contributions of freeform buildings in future similar projects. Therefore, this research will study design and construction methods for freeform surfaces, particular the concrete surface frame of freeform buildings based on BIM, focused on the Tri-Bowl project. This study attempts to analyze the pros and cons of each method for the concrete surface frame of the Tri-Bowl, and then presents the lessons learned and implications related to the design and construction process of the freeform architecture. Several implications for design and construction of concrete surface frame of the freeform building, the Tri-Bowl, are found. The first is that manufacturing and installation of a curved concrete frame is precisely performed based on the exact numerical values of materials and installation made using BIM 3D technologies, such as CATIA and Rhino. The second is that close and continuous collaboration among the different participants in the construction of the Tri-Bowl allowed them to cope with virtual conditions.

Analysis tools such as the code checking of building regulations and environmental simulations that can report on heating loads, daylighting and carbon use will influence the adoption of intelligent modelling faster and further than previously thought. The benefits for clients should not be underestimated either and some are already reaping them where project certainty is to the fore. However, the professional language that architects and engineers espouse is a latent force that can run counter to fostering collaboration. An emerging professional, the Architectural Technologist, can bridge that divide and adopt the adjunct role of manager in the integrated project delivery. The impact of digitalisation on the management role of architectural technology leads to four objectives namely; the practicalities of integrating drawing operations; the practicalities of design processes within the databased controlled programmes; the mapping of the overall process pitted against individual responsibility, data reliability and standard risk and the significant contribution to an understanding of how IMTs will drive changes within the discipline of Architectural Technology through the next decade. These objectives were then tested to establish whether there was an evolution in the manner in which the design team is structured. They included; how the opportunities for BIM are impacting design strategies, how they are impacting associated management structures and a deeper analysis of the changing role of the architectural technologist as a result of adoption.

Purpose This paper introduces a building information model (BIM)\u2010based user pre\u2010occupancy evaluation method (UPOEM), which is applied in architectural design stage to narrow the gap between inexperienced clients and designers. It aims to improve the communication efficiency. Design/methodology/approach The literature review studied the related technologies applied in the UPOEM, which includes building information modeling, user activity scheduling, and requirements documentation method. Based on the building information model, a virtual environment involving the end\u2010users' daily activities was built up. In this virtual environment, the clients can observe how their organization will be accommodated in the built environment according to their daily work routines. A requirements and feedback interface was designed to facilitate the clients to conduct a pre\u2010occupancy evaluation and store the relevant information into the database. Findings In briefing and design stages, there is a considerable gap between the inexperienced clients and designers when the clients specify requirements and review the design solutions. In the UPOEM, the user activity simulation model can facilitate clients to obtain a better understanding of the design. The requirements and feedback interface can also help them specify requirements and give comments to the design. Thus it provided an alternative tool to improve the efficiency of the designer\u2010client communication. Research limitations/implications This research established a virtual platform which involves both building information and the user activity information. This platform can be further extended by the integration of more building performance simulation tools. Thus it provided a potential to bring the traditional post occupancy evaluation process to the pre\u2010construction stage. Practical implications The implementation of this method in practice can improve the efficiency of the designer\u2010client communication, and also maximize the clients' satisfaction during the requirements specification and design review process.

When a worker injured or dead, it has a direct effect on the financial aspect of the sustainable design beside it is obviously in contradiction to the green design principals. So it may provide a design with the most sustainability when the occupational safety and health, energy conversation and environmental protection come together. To help designers in PtD, a variety of tools have been developed. The newest category of tools are 3D(three-dimensional) and 4D computer-aided-design(CAD) models and Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies which assist in visualizing 3D components to detect interferences between building systems and spatial-temporal workspace conflicts during construction.

One of the significant benefits of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the ability to effectively use analysis and evaluation programs during design, as feedback. However, the current dominant approach to analysis and evaluation of design proposals requires the creation of a separate building model for each kind of evaluation. This typically involves using a BIM tool to prepare the data for a specific type of analysis to obtain design feedback. Most of the effort lies in modifying the building model to support the analysis required. When dealing with multiple evaluations, this process is time consuming, greatly reducing the design benefits of BIM. We propose a system architecture to facilitate analysis and feedback in architectural design, based on post-processing design-oriented building models. The post-processing automatically adapts the building model to the needs of the specific analysis, where multiple analyses can be run from the same building model. We outline the methods for realizing such design interoperability. By utilizing geometric and attribute relationships and semantics, data subsets are identified and aggregated. We present an example where the design of a class of buildings \u2013 federal courthouses, is evaluated in terms of multiple analyses: programmatic spaces, building circulation, energy consumption, and preliminary cost. These analyses are performed by post-processing a single BIM model. The method is applicable to both API-based direct interfaces as well as open-standard building models.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1990580995"}}

The aim of this research was to evaluate the current implementation of BIM and to identify trends in the teaching of BIM in architecture and construction academic programs. A survey that investigated the implementation of BIM into accredited programs in architecture and construction education was sent to architecture and construction schools in the U.S. The survey results indicated that most architecture and construction schools either have an interest in or have already implemented BIM into their curriculum. The majority of the schools expected students to have a basic knowledge of BIM upon graduation; perceived BIM as important to industry; and planned to fully integrate BIM into their curriculum. The results show that more architecture than construction schools have implemented BIM into their curriculum.

The UK has a housing deficit, requiring 3 million new homes by 2020 that will have to conform to national environmental policy and the corresponding regional building regulation requirements. The economic down turn has exacerbated this problem and as a result there is now an even greater need to employ an offsite Modern Method of Construction (MMC) approach.  The current implementation of innovative timber offsite MMC techniques is limited due to the lack of availability of a Eurocode compliant software platform that is generic across the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector. This constraint was identified when timber engineering innovations were restricted from being embedded into practice after being developed with architectural firms and construction companies.  As a result the Centre for Off-site Construction and Innovative Structures (COCIS) at the Institute of Sustainable Construction (ISC), Edinburgh Napier University is currently developing an integrated whole house engineering (WHE) system based on Tedds\u00ae for Word (Tedds), CSC Inc.

Under this circumstance, the study surveyed opinions of project managers and conducted a pilot test to improve evaluation criteria of BIM-based design for housing complexes. The objective is to assess the level of BIM technology and its applicability, and to propose a list of reasonable evaluation criteria for better project management. First, the study examined the current condition of evaluation on the BIM-based housing complexes, and identified 15 preliminary items that might be suitable for application of BIM. Second, the study conducted a pilot test for the 15 items to determine their suitability for the level of BIM technology, clarity of the calculation process, and the extent of fulfilling information quality, and short-listed eight items for application of BIM. In particular, in the design concept stage, mostly 3D visual images and area-related items are suitable for BIM-based evaluation.

The Construction Industry has been criticized several times for their slow development and for not being as productive as other industries. In orderto achieve an efficient Architecture, Engineering & Construction (AEC) Industry, Building Information Modeling, BIM, is one of the most debatedtopics in the field. The work process, which is about to efficiently provide information about a project, is already applied in the building construction. On the other hand, bridge and civil construction are just about to start the implementation of BIM.NCC Montagebro is a prefabricated concrete bridge which was developed in the 1980s and is once again up-to-date for product development. Theprevious standard dimensions have been removed in order to meet the customers\u2019 requirements for length and width. A problem that occurs when allowing the customers to choose the dimensions is that there is no corresponding documentation to base the pricing on. The aim of this work was to investigate the possibility of establishing a parametric BIM model to use for quantity take off. A goal was to facilitate the continuing improvement of the product by highlighting obstacles and opportunities.The study was carried out through interviews and a practical case study. The results of these were discussed from the stated research questions andthe previously reported literature review.An important aspect emerging from the study is that the ability to rationalize and standardize the pricing depends on the degree of standardizationof the whole bridge concept. To make a general and flexible model it is necessary to examine which dimensions and parameters that should be set to default and which can be freely adjusted for each new project. These decisions and all other documents of experience should be gathered in a special technical platform for the NCC Montagebro.The study concludes that it is possible to rationalize the pricing of NCC Montagebro by using BIM but the arguments may not be enough to design a BIM model. The model should be provided with additional information so that it can be used in several sub-processes because otherwise, a large part of the purpose of BIM is lost.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W614895982"}}

In recent ten years, Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been proposed and applied in the industry of architecture. For the high efficiency and visualization, BIM and correlative technologies are welcomed by architects, engineers, builders and owners, thus the technologies on modeling for design has been widely researched. However, little attention is given to simulation while simulation is an important part of design for building, maybe because it is seen as somewhat less related to the technologies on modeling for design. The paper proposed a simulation framework with four stages of design: concept stage, scheme design stage, preliminary design stage and construction drawing design stage. The principles of simulation are different in each stage, and were given in the paper. In concept stage, simulation focuses on the blocks of building, and the unit of simulation grid is comparable with the unit of field. And the objects of simulation in the stage are wind, light and sound. In scheme design stage, the unit of simulation grid is similar to the one in concept stage. The objects of simulation in the stage are heat, wind, light, energy consumption and sound. In preliminary design stage, simulations turn to pay attention to the systems of the building, such as the energy system, power system, transmission and distribution system, air-conditioning system and ventilation system. The unit of simulation grid is comparable with the unit of indoor space of building. In construction drawing design stage, the details of system is the main objects of simulation, the unit of simulation grid is usually 100-500mm. The data conversion is also discussed, because data conversion is important for the simulation in BIM system. Previous simulation paid much more time on modeling because the buildings were often designed with 2D floor plan while simulation models often were 3D model. The simulation in BIM process makes the modeling easier and quicker. However, the data of different formats have difficulties on modeling conversion. Several main formats of 3D-model are discussed in the paper. The models of gbXML, Sketch Up, 3ds, CATIA, Rhino and Revit can be transferred to simulation software and modified to meet the need of simulation. The transfer principles of each format during different stage are discussed in the paper. The gbXML and Revit have advantages as less workload on modification, less information lost in the conversion and quick response to the change of model. An example of whole process of simulation in BIM design is proposed in the paper. The simulations for the BIM process are applied in the design of Zhuhai Grand Theater. The simulation in Zhuhai Grand Theater also can be divided into four stages. The example mainly focused on the indoor and outdoor wind environment and energy consumption, and the data conversion is applied in the simulation. The efficiency of such simulation process was compared with the traditional process and the result showed that new simulation process in BIM has advantages as time saving, simple and easily controllable.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2111912951"}}

There are four different ways to streamline the processes; Building Information Modelling (BIM), Lean Construction, industrialized building and partnering. In this examination paper we have investigated the possibility to streamline a specified company\u2019s processes whit lean and BIM. More specific we have investigated NVS Installation AB\u2019s processes from the customer\u2019s request for a quote to construction planning. By studying BIM- and lean-literature we have gained deeper knowledge in how these can be used to streamline NVS processes. To be able to give examples of how NVS processes can be streamlined we have conducted a case study that shows how they work today. In the case study we have studied NVS intranet and conducted interviews. Lean is the western interpretation of the Toyota production system. The philosophy of lean is to work smarter to achieve efficiency. Lean will make processes more efficient by; creating continues flow to bring up problems to the surface, eliminate waste and by working whit continues improvement. When working whit lean it is important to engage the whole company. Only by doing this, efficiency can be achieved. BIM is the new way of working in the building process. With BIM you create and use information in a digital model that represents a building or a facility. A building model is composed of objects that contain more information than just geometry. The information in the building model can be displayed in different views, for example construction documents, quantity takeoffs and clash detection. The conclusion shows that NVS can streamline their processes with lean and BIM. For example the calculator can create a building model and then it can be used and developed in the following processes. BIM and lean complement each other, by creating an output calculation from the building model you will for example get the opportunity track how the planning differs from the production. By tracking and reflecting, continuous improvement can be implemented which is an important part of lean. (Less)", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1840160811"}}

Background BIM, Building Information Modelling, is a relatively new approach to work with building design and information management within the building industry. As higher demands are placed on product information and information management, manufacturers of building materials have to meet the need for BIM objects and 3D modeling. Ecophon is a supplier of sound absorbing ceilings and wall absorber systems. Problem specification and research question What are the user\u2019s demands and needs for a BIM object of a suspended ceiling system, and how can such an object be designed to meet these requirements? Purpose and aims The purpose is to conduct a survey to find out how the market for BIM objects look like, and find out which properties related to ceilings that are important when working with 3D modeling and BIM. The goal is to identify the building process in terms of ceilings and how the use of the various amounts of information looks like. The survey will form the basis for the development of an example of a BIM object for a suspended ceiling system. Scope and limitations The thesis is limited to Tyrens\u2019 and Ecophon\u2019s interests, and the building component ceiling. The Swedish market is in focus during the investigation of the need for BIM objects. Method and implementation The method involves literature studies, market research and studies of existing product libraries and BIM objects. The method also consists of interviews with actors involved in the building process and 3D modeling. The building process for suspended ceiling is determined through literature studies and interviews. Various process schemes are created to illustrate the building process around ceilings, and how the related information can be handled with help from BIM. Results An example of a BIM object representing a ceiling system is developed in the software Revit Architecture, based on the information that has been collected through the literature study, interviews and market research. The BIM object contains information and properties that has been found as important among the target group. Based on what is possible to accomplish with current technology and development within BIM, the object functions are selected. Analysis and discussion A BIM object representing a ceiling system should have a relatively simple structure and only contain parameters and properties that are utterly necessary. The concept of BIM includes that as much information as possible should be linked to a virtual model, which reduces the risk of possible errors in the process. Conclusion A BIM object should only contain essential features and parameters. The BIM object should be designed as a graphic pattern in the shape of a grid, to display the size and location of the ceiling tiles. An important part is to integrate the data that can be used during the facility management to the BIM object. The users require that parameters containing information about the product name, manufacturer, fire ratings and sound insulation should be available in the BIM object. The BIM object should be created as a project file for the program Revit Architecture, as it is the most common software that is used for modeling today.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1883778182"}}
