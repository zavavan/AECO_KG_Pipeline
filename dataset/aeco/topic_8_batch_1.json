This research aims to investigate the anticipated benefits and implicated challenges from imposing the green building regulations on the construction industry in Dubai; primarily seeking to facilitate the planned move through effective recommendations on how to proactively manage the identified challenges. The literature review aimed to compare and contrast the implementation practices for the mandatory regulations versus the voluntary rating systems, and the implicated challenges from imposing the green building regulations in general, and specifically in Dubai. The study applied a stepwise methodology embracing an online survey utilising a questionnaire sent to 150 professionals in Dubai who are involved in regulating and implementing the green regulations. The second step comprised a set of interviews with experts to discuss the findings of the survey and suggest recommendations to address the identified challenges, proactively. A statistical analysis was applied to the survey dataset whereas a content analysis was applied to the interviews dataset. The key findings of the study indicated that experts within the construction industry are still sceptical about green practices due to the perceived higher costs. This reflected the lack of awareness besides the minimal involvement of private sector in setting the green building regulations, amongst other challenges. Many Professional preferred the voluntary systems due to the perceived rigidity of the intended regulations and the reviewers from the regulatory bodies. The study concluded that the government, in order to can enhance the implementation of the green building regulations in Dubai, needs to introduce effective measures to promote the green building initiative to all categories of stakeholders; both the supply side and the demand side meanwhile increasing the involvement of the private sector in the consultation process leading to the release of the new regulations.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2743601489"}}

ABSTRACT Green building is currently being an important issue in Indonesia\u2019s development. The green building concept for development should apply the environmental principles, start from design, construction, operation, and management. As time has emerged certified Green Building in Indonesia. Green Building Council Indonesia (GBCI) as a certification body has issued a New Building GREENSHIP Version 1.1 as a guide to green building assessment criteria for new buildings. One of the criteria that assessed is Appropriate Web Development (ASD). The criteria contained in 7 sub-criteria which have 17 points maximum. These sub criteria are, site selection, community accessibility, public transportation, bicycle, site landscaping, micro climate and storm water management. This study was conducted to determine how ASD criteria applied at Campus B Diponegoro University, by measuring the object based on GREENSHIP NB Version 1.1 rating tools. From the results of the study, Campus B Diponegoro University earns 7 points out of a total 17 points, or approximately 41.18% rating level for ASD.

The focus of this thesis research was on developing an assessment protocol which assists the structural engineer in visualizing the structural possibilities for multi-story industrial heritage constructed between 1910 and 1950. The protocol distinguishes seven assessment steps which can be used to (1) indicate the material and structural quality (2) visualize the structural design possibilities and (3) assess the structural safety. The systematic approach introduced by the protocol stimulates a faster and more efficient determination of the comprehensive capabilities of the concrete load bearing frame. The protocol is developed from the context of integrated designing, giving the structural engineer an independent role in the redevelopment process. The individual assessment steps [the historic assessment, the visual assessment, the technical assessment, evaluation, the preliminary assessment, the [refined] structural safety assessment and the strenghtening assessment] are provided with current knowledge and trends available for the assessment of existing reinforced concrete structures. These steps are subjected to constant change and development. The structural engineer is therefore encouraged to supplement the protocol with experience gained during projects, and with future developments. The engineer is recommended to follow the assessment steps as proposed by the protocol. In cases where this is not possible the engineer should use the protocol to formulate a targeted assessment strategy, which minimizes the influences of the obstructed process. The protocol will provide the information, but requires the motivation and capabilities of the engineer to come to the desired results. QUALITY The first four assessment steps are designed to assist the visualization of the structural and material quality. The steps are focussed in gathering a sufficient amount of information to prevent unexpected situations in the construction or execution phase. The engineer should be aware that in the design of new buildings the information produced on paper will be realized, whereas in the situation of redesigning existing buildings what is realized should be put on paper. The information that is needed to estimate the remaining life span and to perform the structural safety assessment can only be found insitu. In some situations also design information can be found in the original document, but the engineer should be aware that his information always brings a certain level of inaccuracy and uncertainty. The first assessment step is the historic assessment which helps the engineer to collect a sufficient amount of original documentation [architectural design, structural design, reinforcement design, foundation etc.] to visualize the quality and characteristics of the load bearing system. The assessment step is substantiated by a historic database which informs the modern structural engineer about the material and structural characteristics of historic concrete. This concept is introduced to bridge the knowledge gap between past and present and eliminate possible risks occurring from this gap by visualizing the differences in material durability, and provide structural information to clarify the original documentation or when no original information is available to substantiate the making of assessment assumptions. The quality assessment of materials and structures is time consuming, expensive and difficult when performed into detail. The structural engineer is therefore challenged to formulate a targeted and efficient approach without compromising the desired information. To stimulate this process the protocol introduces at the end of the historic assessment a general strategy which helps to formulate the desired and required input and output regarding the visual and technical assessment. The visual assessment stimulates the engineer to visualize the structural and material quality in-situ, by proposing a visual inspection towards deterioration and the optical verification of the original drawings. The assessment V step also provides a description of the non-destructive measuring techniques which can either be used to verify certain forms of deterioration or to verify the test results found with the technical assessment. At the end of the visual assessment the engineer is granted the possibility to take concrete and steel samples for additional research to be performed in the laboratory to indicate, the mechanical properties, the cause of deterioration or to estimate future deterioration. The protocol provides an estimate of the required research pool, and the considerations which have to be taken into account when estimating the sample location. The technical assessment step provides the structural engineer with a general introduction on the different laboratory tests, and their specifications. The quality assessment is completed by introducing the evaluation step, which provides the structural engineer with the general methodology for reinforced concrete repair and protection. This methodology points out the importance for conservation, and a durable and compatible approach. The assessment step also provides a list with the general methods that can be used for repair and protection. DESIGN POSSIBILITIES The identification of the quality and the visualization of the structural design is the basic input of the preliminary assessment stage. This stage is focussed on generating structural redevelopment concepts based on a pragmatic approach, and from the context of integrated designing. This process stimulates the designer\u2019s creativity in visualizing the structural possibilities with respect to functional change. The success of redevelopment seen from a structural perspective depends on the aspects of structural flexibility, the structural adaptability, the relation between building and user, and the standard redevelopment criteria [climate, day light entrance, emergency routing etc.]. To stimulate the successful integration of these design aspects into the redevelopment, the engineer is advised to use a morphological overview. Such an overview gathers the different structural aspects and combines them with possible structural redevelopment alternatives. The overview facilitates the making of combinations, generating redevelopment concepts and to rerun the design steps in a later stadium of the process. As a last note, the preliminary assessment recommends the engineer to generate the structural concepts from the concept of durable and sustainable design. The sustainable perspective requires the engineer to design with an eye on the future, whereas a durable design minimizes the need for functional change in the future. STRUCTURAL SAFETY The safety assessment of existing structures is different than the safety assessment for new structures. The differences can be found in the required aspects of the limit state design, and the considerations towards the structural reliability, the fire safety and the capacity estimation. The [refined] structural safety assessment visualizes the options regarding these different subjects, and clarifies their influences. The assessment stage also gives a general introduction on the methodology influencing the in depth detailing of the calculations and their reflection onto the desired results. In some situations the functional requirements exceed the bearing capacity of the load bearing structure. In such a case strengthening could be an option to improve the chances on redevelopment. Therefore, as last assessments stage the strengthening assessment is introduced. This assessment step visualizes the methodology towards estimating the required strengthening in respect to the ultimate and serviceability limit state design, and gives a general introduction on the strengthening methods available on today\u2019s market.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W28011487"}}

Recent patterns and trends are considered for projects certified using LEED-NC and LEED-EBOM (new construction and existing buildings, respectively) rating systems. New data are presented on (1) patterns and trends in on-going market transformation (credit achievement, levels of certification and types, geographic distribution of project, etc.) and (2) the design and revision of the LEED rating system based on broad patterns of engagement and the achievement of individual credits. The data indicate strong regional and temporal variation in green building activity. The flexibility of LEED has allowed a diversity of credit achievement patterns.

This paper has attempted to collect and review the application of LCA in the building industry in Asia from the selected publications over the last 12 years, from 2001 to 2012. The result shows that most LCA research basic methodology is based on International Organization of Standardization (ISO) 14040 series but with variance. It is found that the operational phase consume highest energy and concrete responsible for the highest total embodied energy and environmental impact. It also suggested that building material with low initial embodied energy does not necessarily have low life cycle energy. Overall, findings from LCA studies can help to make informed decisions in terms of environmental impact and help realizing sustainable buildings in the future.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2007708937"}}

Sustainability assessments of buildings are well known to result in certificates, which are mainly used for marketing purposes. This conference contribution does not tackle the marketing perspective but focuses on the sustainability assessment of buildings as a risk management tool for corporate real estate management. Buildings have a long life span, and it is important to ensure a stable performance of the property during several decades. Regarding market demand, the building location is undoubtedly a very high ranked criterion when it comes to making the decision to buy or rent a building or building unit or not. Nevertheless, building specific quality characteristics such as energy efficiency characteristics related with the building envelope and the HVAC system, characteristics related with the indoor air quality, and quality characteristics from the facility management perspective to reduce running cost have been gaining in importance, due to the following exemplary reasons: (1) Energy: Even if clients seldom demand for energy efficiency, this topic is definitely on the rise due the legal framework conditions such as the EPBD (Energy Performance of Buildings Directive) and the EED (Energy Efficiency Directive); if a building is not fit to be able to comply with the requirements to come, upgrading might be more expensive than taking energy efficiency into account from the beginning. (2) Indoor climate: Productivity depends on social aspects, but also on building related aspects such as air quality, summer and winter comfort, quality of light, and noise level; this area is more a subject of competition on the market than energy, because of the impact on people's health and productivity. (3) Materials: The type of fa\u00e7ade and choice of materials in general has a strong influence on running costs; a wise choice results in a reduction of cleaning costs. All these aspects are finally cost-related factors, which might affect the saleability of a property. Building assessment schemes provide a full range of decision-making criteria to consider all building related aspects, which are already on the rise or might become important in the near future. However, it is the responsibility of the informed expert to decide between options. This conference contribution uses the Austrian sustainable building assessment scheme (\u00d6GNB \u2013 ASBC) to demonstrate the relation between building assessment criteria and risk factors.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3122422657"}}

In the development of real property, the availability of money to secure construction resources becomes an important factor for success. The construction loan plays a central role in providing funds to erect a building on real property, but a lender faces numerous exposures that might result in a loss. In evaluating a project to determine its viability and to uncover any exposure it might present, a lender will conduct an extensive underwriting review process and will use mitigation techniques through the construction loan agreement and disbursement requirements to reduce the perceived risks to an acceptable business level, for those developments deemed worthy. With the recent transition into more sustainable construction practices, many lenders will fail to recognize that the construction of a green building differs from a traditional one. The meaningful distinctions between these different methods merit an evaluation of their own in order to properly assess and manage the risk associated with a construction loan for a green building. Accordingly, this article seeks to address the unique issues associated with a construction loan for a green building and provide solutions that can mitigate the exposures presented to acceptable levels.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3121674883"}}

Recently, as the concern over environmental problem has been serious all over the world, carbon has become a key issue to mitigate the problem. In the field of Architecture, various sustainable assessment systems and LCCO2 assessment strategies have been developed, guiding low carbon building while planning. However, assessment system for low carbon neighborhood, which can be more efficient strategy, is still in the stage of research. In this paper, as a research for low carbon assessment system and planning guideline for neighborhood, scope meeting domestic condition has been set and sustainable assessment system for neighborhood, which is similar to low carbon concept, have been compared. LEED-Neighborhood Development, BREEAM-Communities, CASBEE-Urban Development, and GBCC-Apartment Houses were used for comparison. As a result, it is found that those systems has many differences in judging system, aggregating method, scope of evaluation, and relations with a building assessment system. The concern about carbon is not insufficient yet. Finally, assessment system for low carbon neighborhood, which is not only for establishing the plan, but also for giving guideline at the very first state of the plan, should be developed as fast as passible.

Monolithic structure is a type of structure in which a building is constructed from a single piece of material without constructing the structural elements primarily. What is structure? Conventional structure is a type of structure in which the primary structure elements are formed by system of repetitive form work . \uf02d What is MASCON CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM? Developed in the late 1970s by Canadian engineer WJ Malone, the Mascon Construction System is a system for forming the cast-in-place concrete structure of a building. The Mascon System has been used successfully throughout the world over a period of more than 25 years to construct thousands of housing units of all heights and sizes. The Mascon System is most effective when combined with load- bearing wall structural design.

ABSTRACT Exergy-based Index for the assessment of building sustainability Ahmed El shenawy, Ph.D. Concordia University, 2013 \tThe declining state of the environment, combined with the increasing scarcity of natural resources and economic recession, presents us with the need to discover building practices that are capable of producing sustainable buildings. Building promoters are racing to certify the sustainability of their projects, aware that building sustainability assessment will delineate the features of current and future building practice. A sustainable building implies that resource depletion and waste emissions are considered during its whole life cycle. This research project proposes a new methodology and Exergy-based Index to assess building sustainability and to assist decision makers comparing building alternatives, since the wrong decisions can lead to serious consequences and even precipitate crises. The proposed methodology uses the SBTool that has been utilized for defining the criteria for analysing and ranking the environmental performance of buildings. Over the past decade, significant efforts have been made in developing Sustainable Building (SB) assessment tools that allow all stakeholders/actors to be aware of the consequences of various choices and to assess building performance. These SB tools, approaches, rating systems, indices and methods of assessment have already been utilized in the market (e.g., Multi-Criteria Assessment (MCA) methods, such as LEED and SBTool, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) systems, like ATHENA, and the Single Index (SI) approach (Ecological footprint)). However, are existing SB assessment tools actually capable of considering the regional issues? Is it possible to use them to assess all types of buildings? Are they objective, easy to customize? Is it easy to interpret their final assessment results and are those results transparent to the end users? Despite the usefulness of the current assessment methods in contributing towards a more sustainable building industry, some of the limitations and critiques of these assessment methods indicate that the tools should evolve toward a genuinely generic and scientifically global SB assessment tool.  After discussing and summarizing the limitations of the existing definitions, indices and rating systems for building sustainability assessment, a definition of a sustainable building in terms of thermodynamics is proposed, mainly based on the exergy concept. This proposal is supported by a general mathematical calculation for the exergy-based index of building sustainability. The index uses the comparison between the available solar exergy (considered to be the only renewable energy source) and the exergy lost due to a building\u2019s construction and operation to measure the a building\u2019s sustainability. Moreover, the selection and transfer of data from the SBTool, and the assumptions and additional calculations required for the assessment of the exergy-based index of sustainability are presented and quantified. A rating scale is also presented along with the index of building sustainability. Finally, case studies of residential and commercial buildings are used to demonstrate the framework\u2019s reliability. The contribution of the proposed Exergy-based index is evaluated by comparing its similarities and differences with a selection of the available building assessment tools and methods.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W197780833"}}

A public agency that decides to implement green design and construction features in its capital improvement program is actually adding an undetermined incremental cost to the initial cost of public buildings. Past research has portrayed these costs as a percentage increase, essentially creating an overall contingency for green buildings, but no work has been done to quantify the incremental cost on a building's actual design program that can be assigned directly to the project budget. This research sought to provide an objective approach to estimating sustainable design and proposes a framework for estimating the initial capital costs of sustainable building design and construction as measured by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification program. The framework allows tracking of costs during design and can be utilized for estimating future projects. The framework is developed using case study analysis of green building projects in OK City, Oklahoma. The paper concludes that the cost of \u201cgoing green\u201d can be estimated as a unit price basis as a cost per LEED credit. The proposed framework can be used by any public agency to determine the additional cost of LEED certification and for budgeting future projects.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1984064027"}}

In 2003, the Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA) launched their Green Star rating tools for various types of buildings in order to promote green building practice in Australia. Of these, the Green Star-Office Interior rating tool is designed for building owners, tenants and interior designers to assess the environmental impact of an interior fitout. It covers a number of categories, including Management, Indoor Environment Quality, Energy, Transport, Water, Materials, Land Use and Ecology, Emissions, and Innovation. This paper reviews the usage of the Green Star system in Australian office tenancy fitouts and the potential challenges associated with Green Star-Office Interior implementation. This involves the analysis of score sheets of 66 office interior projects across Australia that achieved Green Star certification. The percentage of green star points obtained within each category and sub-categories (credits) for each project are investigated to illustrate the achievement of credits. The results show that Emission-related credits and Innovation related credits are the easiest and most difficult respectively to obtain. It is also found that 6 Green Star office interior projects perform especially better in the categories of Energy and Ecology than 4 and 5 Star projects.

In this context, the quality of the documentation of the capacity and functionality of building structures has been criticised and a common understanding of content and quality assurance of the documentation of load-bearing building structures has been identified. Based on experience from the Danish building industry as well as guidelines published by the Danish Building Research Institute, the paper discusses the outline and control of documentation of load-bearing building structures. The qualitative analysis includes the content of individual parts of the documentation. A distinction between the documentation of the physical structures and the documentation of the design process is introduced. Furthermore, the organisation of the design process and tasks related to the individual parts of the documentation are discussed both regarding the engineer in charge of the main design and for the individual engineering tasks for all elements of the structure, including drawings and structural calculations. Finally, the paper discusses a set of information and document management issues of critical importance for the resulting safety of the documented load-bearing structures; e.g. how to administer, document, identify and draw up the individual parts of the documentation; especially how to incorporate results from digital modelling and simulation of structural behaviour into the documentation.

The construction industry has been a major player in Korean economy growth and it has been accountable for more than 15% of GDP during the last decade. However, fast-growing construction industry has also produced some unpleasant side-effects. Environmental problems are identified one of the main issues in the Korean construction industry and they are closely related to minimizing the carbon emission and delivering environmental-friendly green products. The movement of green construction, now, is considered the next driving force for the industry which has significant impacts on the future. This research investigates this green construction while focusing on governmental policy implications such as green certificate for construction products. Green building has long been recognized as the leading green construction product and the green trends have expanded to infrastructure construction such as road construction. Therefore, this research concentrates on various green road certification processes in the United States in order to develop a framework for Korean green road certification. In doing so, some of the green roads application has also been analyzed. This research intends to provide background information for Korean green construction policies, especially on green road certification.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1824827045"}}

Hyperbolic cooling towers of ever greater height have been constructed since 1914. As the height of the shells increased, engineers became increasingly concerned about the effects of wind loads on these structures and likely adapted methodologies from tall building and chimney practice for the designs. The failure of three of a group of eight completed cooling towers with height 114 meters at Ferrybridge, UK, in 1965 exposed the inadequacy of the then prevailing procedures for wind design and served to initiate and accelerate research programs on a wide variety of subjects. Topics included wind pressure magnitude and distribution, stability, ring stiffeners, column supports, reinforcement quantities and placement, seismic resistance, imperfections, temperature and shrinkage, soil-structure interaction, concentrated surface loads, openings and construction loading. In this paper, several of these research topics are discussed briefly, with emphasis on those that have influenced the design, construction and damage assessment of cooling towers in the US. The evolution of tower design procedures is traced and a discussion of unanticipated damage and failures during construction is offered. The application of modern analytical methods and experimental research studies to understand the cause of the damages and failures and to propose corrective procedures is emphasized.

In 1994, a seismic event in Northridge, California caused between $16 billion and $20 billion worth of damage to multi-family wood apartment buildings and brought to question construction quality, framing practices, structural design methodology, and the role of local jurisdiction in adoption, enforcement and oversight of building codes. The majority of damage to wood-framed structures occurred in apartment buildings of 3 stories or less. Damaged structures showed evidence of inadequate or complete lack of structural designs and poor construction quality associated to building age and structural irregularities. Specifically, `tuck-under parking'1 apartment building presented some of the most significant failures due to the weak-story condition created by the lack of rigidity in the lower level space frames as well as building code allowances for the use of prescriptive path methods without the approval of a licensed Architect or Engineer, a construction method still available in most jurisdictions, but now subject to significant limitations. The 1997 edition of the Uniform Building Code (UBC) incorporated revised seismic hazard maps and regulated prescriptive path construction methods for wood commercial buildings resulting in trends towards the use of concrete or steel for mid-rise apartment buildings.

INTRODUCTION. When the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in Pittsburgh was completed in 2003, it was one of largest green buildings in the country. Its success proved that sustainability principles could be integrated into a breathtaking and high-performing design. Using almost a decade of performance data, this study, led by evolveEA, was commissioned to understand the level of building performance and the return on the initial investment in sustainability. With input from Carnegie Mellon University's Center for Building Performance and Diagnostics, CJL Engineering, and Civil and Environmental Consultants, the Buildings-in-Operation (BiO) study demonstrates that:investment in high performance systems can yield direct savings and improved sustainability operations and maintenance practices;green building projects can accelerate broader organizational sustainability efforts;green buildings can create major benefits for a region, including additional commerce and an increased uptake of green building design and;high performing projects can affect their industry standards by setting a standard for future design and construction, but also by facilitating a culture of best practice sharing, benchmarking, and peer comparison.Publicly-owned facilities such as stadiums and convention centers are capital-intensive structures in both their construction and their operation. Because of this, large-scale public facilities need to compare upfront investment in high performance design and construction to the expected return on the investment (ROI) over the lifespan of the building. There are many challenges to understanding ROI in these circumstances. For example, these civic structures often have dynamic use patterns with conflicting indicators of success, (e.g., days without events may lower energy usage but those days do not generate revenue.) In addition, civic structures often operate as a \u201closs leader,\u201d or a facility that isn't profitable itself but that attracts visitors and money to a region. This requires that return on investment be measured against larger regional returns.It is in this context that Pittsburgh initiated the design and construction of a new convention center in the early 1990s. Eight years later, the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County (now called the Sports and Exhibition Authority), the Southwestern Pennsylvania Convention Center Design Commission, and a number of regional foundations created a design competition that would become the first design competition for a public facility since H. H. Richardson designed the highly acclaimed Allegheny County Courthouse in the 1880s. With the support of the partners, a regional nonprofit, the Green Building Alliance, led the efforts to include green design in the competition criteria, resulting in the selection of the winning design by Raphael Vinoly.Upon its completion in 2003, the David L. Lawrence Convention Center (DLCC) received a Gold level certification from the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for New Construction (LEED-NC) green building rating system, making it the world's largest green building and the first LEED certified convention center in the world. This pursuit was leveraged through a multimillion dollar foundation grant that came with the condition that the facility would be reviewed to understand the effectiveness and value of green design. With eight years of available operational data, the Heinz Endowments commissioned this post-occupancy evaluation to quantify specific benefits and costs of designing and building a green building and to provide recommendations for the Sports and Exhibition Authority and SMG World (the building operator) to continue improvements (Case Study for the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, 2012).Among its findings, the study found that the investment in green building certification and high performance systems has been recouped through annual operational cost savings at the DLCC. It also found that the DLCC's leadership in sustainable practices has given it a competitive advantage. The increased business due to this leadership has positively impacted both direct and indirect regional spending and has catalyzed an industry across the country. The DLCC's commitment to sustainability has been an explicit attraction for many high-profile events, including the U.S. Green Building Council's Greenbuild Conference and Expo (2003) and the G-20 Summit (2009). In fact, the DLCC's success has been a contributing factor in raising the standards for sustainable practices in the convention industry, as evidenced by the soon-to-be-released APEX/ASTM Green Meetings and Events Standards.1Some highlights and achievements as a result of the DLCC BiO investigation, completed in early 2011, can be summarized as follows:The Business Case for Sustainability: The investigation built a strong business case that clearly defined the value of its sustainability initiatives and galvanized organizational support for future investments.

This thesis contains an assessment and discussion of the sustainability of design for deconstruction. As a basis for the work, existing literature was reviewed and the gaps in existing knowledge highlighted. Environmental assessment methods were identified as a way to incentivise design for deconstruction.  An analysis of LEED demonstrated minimal achievement of reuse credits, likely due to limited availability of reused materials. The supply chain can be developed in the future through the design for deconstruction of all new buildings.  Quantifying the environmental benefits of design for deconstruction was underlined as a key strategy to encourage designers to consider the incorporation of design for deconstruction. A methodology was developed to account for designed-in future reuse at the initial design stage. This is based on a PAS2050 methodology (2008) which shares the environmental impact of an element over the number of predicted lives. In the course of this work it has been assumed that the typical building has a fifty year life span, a conservative estimate. Studies in this thesis limit analysis to a hundred year period, giving a possible two lives for the majority of elements. The methodology was used as a basis for the calculation of savings that occur by designing for deconstruction. Initial feasibility studies estimated that a 49% saving in embodied carbon is accomplished by designing for deconstruction. Having demonstrated the potential scope of savings, a tool, Sakura, was developed to enable designers to investigate the savings in embodied energy and carbon for their own schemes. Sakura was used to assess the savings that could be achieved for a range of case studies. Steel and timber frame structures demonstrated the greatest potential savings from design for deconstruction.

USGBC NC Triangle Chapter members were selected for the survey because of their interest in sustainable design and construction practices in North Carolina. After collecting data from the survey participants, the authors developed descriptive statistics to rank the main drivers and barriers of sustainable design and construction. The result indicated that the most important driving factors of sustainable design and construction were energy conservation, improving indoor environmental quality, environmental/resource conservation, and waste reduction. In addition, the most significant barriers to sustainable design and construction were first cost premium of the project, long pay back periods from sustainable practices, tendency to maintain current practices, and limited knowledge and skills of subcontractors.

So their maintenance is important to maintain this wealth, extend the life of these buildings and develop them to be suitable for changing needs and requirements. Neglecting this maintenance leads to degradation, and may cause their demolition and removal to insure, the lives of their occupants in most cases when the treatment is difficult and impossible .Maintenance is considered as the third component after the basic design and implementation for any building. This maintenance is the conservative element of the building with the passage of time throughout its life. The educational buildings are considered one of the buildings which represent a major national treasure so they must be maintained long periods of time in good condition to play its educational role in the most perfect and safest manner. The research aims to highlight the procedures of maintaining educational buildings by reviewing and comparing between one of the most important systems of developed countries in the process of maintenance of buildings and the maintenance system of educational buildings in Egypt, through the review of legislation, administration and the stages of maintenance of educational buildings, and identifying similarities and differences in the performance of the two systems.

Decisions made during a building's early design stages critically determine its environmental impact. However, designers are faced with many decisions during these stages and typically lack intuition on which decisions are most significant to a building's impact. As a result, designers often defer decisions to later stages of the design process. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) can be used to enable better early stage decision-making by providing feedback on the environmental impacts of building information modeling (BIM) design choices. This paper presents a method for applying LCA to early stage decision-making in order to inform designers of the relative environmental impact importance of building component material and dimensioning choices. Sensitivity analysis is used to generalize the method across a range of building shapes and design parameters. An impact allocation scheme is developed that shows the distribution of embodied impacts among building elements, and an impact reduction scheme shows which material and thickness decisions achieve the greatest embodied impact reductions. A multi-building residential development is used as a case study for introducing the proposed method to industry practice. Results show that the method can assist in the building design process by highlighting those early stage decisions that frequently achieve the most significant reductions in embodied carbon footprint.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1964185618"}}

The demand of eco-friendly or 'green' products and services has experienced considerable growth rates in recent years ranging from agricultural produce, clothing, and consumer electronics to real estate. Various studies for these products have identified that there is increasing willingness of customers to pay a price premium. This trend is supported by increased level of awareness regarding the environmental impact of production and consumption patterns. Real Estate sector consumes higher level of resources, during construction and thereafter hence, contributes in carbon dioxide emissions. Green building construction primarily involves the design, construction, and operation of buildings and other facilities in ways that preserve natural resources and protect the environment for generations to come. The real estate development industry's rapidly growing interest in green buildings in many parts of the world confirms that market forces are leading more developers to adopt sustainable building techniques. Green buildings not only produce substantial operating savings, but also contribute in creating market value, improve health of building occupants and increase productivity. However, the greatest challenge faced by developers and buyers is lack of awareness about the benefits and opportunities of green buildings.

On a global scale, the Gulf Corporation Council Countries (GCCC), including Bahrain, are amongst the top countries in terms of carbon dioxide emissions per capita. Building authority in Bahrain has set a target of 40% reduction of electricity consumption and associated CO2 emissions to be achieved by using facade parameters. This work evaluates how the life cycle CO2 emissions of buildings are affected by facade parameters. The main focus is placed on direct and indirect CO2 emissions from three contributors, namely, chemical reactions during production processes (Pco2), embodied energy (Eco2) and operational energy (OPco2). By means of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, it has been possible to show that the greatest environmental impact occurs during the operational phase (80\u201390%). However, embodied CO2 emissions are an important factor that needs to be brought into the systems used for appraisal of projects, and hence into the design decisions made in developing projects. The assessment shows that masonry blocks are responsible for 70\u201390% of the total CO2 emissions of facade construction, mainly due to their physical characteristics. The highest Pco2 emissions factors are those of window elements, particularly aluminium frames. However, their contribution of CO2 emissions depends largely on the number and size of windows. Each square metre of glazing is able to increase the total CO2 emissions by almost 30% when compared with the same areas of opaque walls. The use of autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) walls reduces the total life cycle CO2 emissions by almost 5.2% when compared with ordinary walls, while the use of thermal insulation with concrete wall reduces CO2 emissions by 1.2%. The outcome of this work offers to the building industry a reliable indicator of the environmental impact of residential facade parameters.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1976665453"}}

Poor and improper building maintenance will definitely cause more damages and costly repair works if left unattended. In Malaysia, buildings are built in accordance with British Standard and under strict supervision. Unfortunately the maintenance aspects of the building are still weak. Making it worse, sometimes building maintenance is perceived as merely about the mechanical and electrical system in the buildings without much consideration given to civil and structural elements. This non-research paper is to discuss the common maintenance problems and building defects on civil and structural elements at the Social Security Organisation (SOCSO) buildings across Malaysia due to various factors. Some common problems involving water proofing system, cracks, soil settlement are discussed in this paper. For instance, with tropical climate and average rainfall of 250 centimetres in a year, a good water proofing system is crucial for buildings with flat roof in Malaysia. However the performance of water proofing systems depend on many factors i.e. quality of the materials, the skill of workers, application methods, substrates condition, weather, maintenance, etc. Recent roof leakage incidents at numerous prestigious buildings such as parliament house, high court and other government buildings has sparked more awareness among the engineering fraternity on the importance of good and systematic building maintenance.

The cradle-to-cradle (C2C) philosophy has been described as a paradigm changing innovative platform for achieving ecologically intelligent and environmentally restorative buildings. Whereas conventional sustainability efforts focus on doing \u201cless harm\u201d to the environment,C2C proposes a radically new way of thinking about waste, renewable energy and promotion of diversity. Industry specific barriers to change however hinder adoption of C2C in the built environment. In this study, it is argued from a synthesis of extant literature that many of these barriers are rooted in socio-cultural factors, a better understanding of which could help accelerate adoption of C2C principles in the built environment. Using business park developments as a backdrop, a framework for interrogating the socio-cultural context within which development projects take place and barriers to C2C adoption is proposed. The framework incorporates the competing values framework which is adapted to facilitate diagnosis and matching of different organisational value profiles to the choices that development stakeholders are likely to make in relation to C2C implementation. A key theoretical proposition which derives from this framework is that stakeholder organisations that subscribe to open system values are more likely to overcome socio - cultural barriers and implement C2C principles as a design model compared to stakeholder organisations that orient towards internal process values. It is anticipated that culture profiles of key stakeholder organisations and the nature of their alignment towards C2C oriented changes will be identified through empirical testing of this framework.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2184083730"}}

Purpose \u2013 The Japanese prefabrication industry not only has automated its processes to a high extent, but it also innovates due to the fact that it delivers buildings of outstanding quality accompanied by a multitude of services. In order to explore and specify the concepts and parameters that have driven this industry, Japan's prefabrication industry, its cultural, economic and technological surrounding, as well as the applied processes, technologies and economic strategies, have to be illustrated and analysed. The purpose of this paper is to identify, describe and analyse these concepts and their related parameters, as well as to recognise the most influential drivers for the future that provide an indication into which direction the industry could evolve.  Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Being aware that literature does not provide relevant information and data, which would allow the authors to explore concepts and parameters explaining the success of the Japanese prefabrication industry, the authors performed field surveys, visited factories, R&D centres and sales points of all major Japanese prefabrication companies. In some cases the authors also interviewed general managers, researchers and developers, and academicians at Japanese universities. Based on an extensive literature review in the area of product development, production technology, modularisation, mass customisation, and innovation, the authors qualitatively and quantitatively analysed all major prefabrication companies according to a fixed scheme.  Findings \u2013 The concepts and parameters identified and analysed in this paper demonstrate that the Japanese prefabrication industry, which is leading in large\u2010scale industrialization, nowadays focuses towards services that are related to the building's utilisation phase, rather than delivering products. By involving customers it enhances the companies' customer relations, thus creating competitive advantages.

The construction loan plays a central role in providing funds to erect a building on real property, but a lender faces numerous exposures that might result in a loss. In evaluating a project to determine its viability and to uncover any exposure it might present, a lender will conduct an extensive underwriting review process and will use mitigation techniques through the construction loan agreement and disbursement requirements to reduce the perceived risks to an acceptable business level, for those developments deemed worthy. With the recent transition into more sustainable construction practices, many lenders will fail to recognize that the construction of a green building differs from a traditional one.

Sustainable building is a concept that began its development nearly two decades ago. With sustainable buildings, it is intended to establish building practices that allow minimizing the buildings impacts,build and manage buildings with an adequate balance between environment, society and economy. However, besides the importance of this concept, its broader implementation is not yet a reality. Several studies have been developed with the goal of understand the reason of these weak implementation. They have concluded that one of the main reasons is because the building stakeholders still consider sustainable practices more expensive, although several studies state the contrary. In order to potentiate the implementation of these practices, a work will be developed in order to perform a cost-benefit analysis of sustainable construction solutions. In order to perform this work, it was necessary, in an initial stage, to define the key indicators that should be considered in order to assess the main aspects of sustainable construction. This paper intends to present the analysis that was performed in order to select these indicators. Comprehensive Assessment System for Building Environmental Efficiency (CASBEE 2012) developed in Japan, among many other. Each one of these tools defines their own set of sustainability indicators depending on the sociocultural environment since the importance of each indicator is different in different contexts. Therefore, several studies (Alwaer and Clements-Croome 2010, Braganca, Mateus et al. 2010, Chen, Okudan et al. 2010) were developed with the goal of develop a specific set of indicators applied to a specific location or type of building. However, these specificities make each tool very different from each other. These differences also led to a problem, since they make the comparison of results obtained through different methodologies difficult (Huovila, 2012). In order to overcome these constraints, the two main standardization organizations, European Normalization Committee (CEN) and the International Standardization Organization (ISO) have been developed work with the goal of standardize the sustainable construction assessment (Mateus and Braganca 2011, Alyami and Rezgui 2012). The goal of most BSA tools is mostly commercial. However, alongside with these tools, some initiatives have been developed by non-profit organizations (iiSBE, SB Challenge, SB Alliance), and through financed projects (LEnSE, SuPerBuildings, OPEN HOUSE), with the goal of defining and developing a set of sustainable buildings key indicators. These initiatives have taken into consideration the developments of several national and international BSA tools, the standards published by ISO and CEN as well as the opinion of some recognized European building construction stakeholders.

An attempt has been made to correlate the factors relating to minimum maintenance and design features of Sustainability. The paper finally concludes that there are certain common agenda in the list of both of these issues, that when taken care of will ultimately handle buildings with more care and make them more sustainable.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W107802296"}}

The construction business is strongly affected by the emerging environmental trends and the increased demand for sustainable solutions and environmentally friendly alternatives. One result of the green trend is the emergence and spread of a variety of systems to measure the sustainability of buildings. Environmental certifications could today be seen as a market demand rather than an option. This has put pressure on not the least construction companies, which are forced to adjust their business to meet the new demands. There are few studies that address how environmental certification systems affect the project processes in a BREEAM certified project. All of NCC Property Developments proprietary commercial properties are since 2009 certified in accordance to BREEAM. A few years after the first projects were initiated, NCC seek further understanding of the impact BREEAM has had on projects in which a certification have been made. On behalf of NCC the authors of this thesis thus conducted an investigation of the first generation of BREEAM certified projects at NCC in Sweden. The purpose of the study was to find an optimal process design. The aim is for the thesis to function as a support in the planning and implementation of future BREEAM certifications at NCC. The results are based on data compiled from a conducted survey in eight projects and semi-structured interviews carried out in three of these projects. Information and experiences from on-going projects have thus been documented and will now be available as a support for following projects. An in-depth analysis of the results has resulted in the identification of four success factors: An early introduction of BREEAM in the process, Spreading the knowledge about BREEAM out in the project, It will get better in time and Designate a person responsible for BREEAM issues. These factors provide an opportunity for future projects to explore and evaluate what factors they wish to take into consideration given their projects specific properties. The main conclusion drawn from the study is that most of the issues and concerns about BREEAM seem to be connected to broader business issues, rather than being specifically connected to BREEAM. Although no process and organizational structure applicable for all BREEAM certified project could be found, the knowledge gathered and presented in this thesis could still serve as a information resource in future certification processes.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W12051022"}}

Sustainability assessments of buildings are well known to result in certificates, which are mainly used for marketing purposes. This conference contribution does not tackle the marketing perspective but focuses on the sustainability assessment of buildings as a risk management tool for corporate real estate management. Buildings have a long life span, and it is important to ensure a stable performance of the property during several decades. Regarding market demand, the building location is undoubtedly a very high ranked criterion when it comes to making the decision to buy or rent a building or building unit or not. Nevertheless, building specific quality characteristics such as energy efficiency characteristics related with the building envelope and the HVAC system, characteristics related with the indoor air quality, and quality characteristics from the facility management perspective to reduce running cost have been gaining in importance, due to the following exemplary reasons: (1) Energy: Even if clients seldom demand for energy efficiency, this topic is definitely on the rise due the legal framework conditions such as the EPBD (Energy Performance of Buildings Directive) and the EED (Energy Efficiency Directive); if a building is not fit to be able to comply with the requirements to come, upgrading might be more expensive than taking energy efficiency into account from the beginning. (2) Indoor climate: Productivity depends on social aspects, but also on building related aspects such as air quality, summer and winter comfort, quality of light, and noise level; this area is more a subject of competition on the market than energy, because of the impact on people's health and productivity. (3) Materials: The type of facade and choice of materials in general has a strong influence on running costs; a wise choice results in a reduction of cleaning costs. All these aspects are finally cost-related factors, which might affect the saleability of a property. Building assessment schemes provide a full range of decision-making criteria to consider all building related aspects, which are already on the rise or might become important in the near future. However, it is the responsibility of the informed expert to decide between options. This conference contribution uses the Austrian sustainable building assessment scheme (OGNB \u2013 ASBC) to demonstrate the relation between building assessment criteria and risk factors.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1514836923"}}

The sheetmetal facade is protected as a historic building, and because of that, itcannot be removed. This puts more demand on an already complicatedbuilding process.

Due to the deterioration of the earth\u2019s health and the uncertainty in terms of climate changes, economy, food, water and energy supplies, the above terms have become worldwide phenomena. Buildings have a huge role to play in addressing the environmental concerns as they play a contributing role in gas emissions, waste disposal and energy use. The literature review and results of the quantitative research amongst experts like facility and building managers, leasing agents, finance managers and project managers in the property sector formed the basis of the study. Although green buildings are regarded as the future, the study revealed that there is a perception, even amongst experts in the property sector that the upfront costs of building green is substantially higher when compared to building conventional, which limits the construction of green buildings. This research is aimed at investigating whether building green leads to financial benefits which will ultimately provide the differentiator when it comes down to a final decision whether to invest in green buildings or not. An overview is also provided on the fundamental principles of green buildings which are important to be implemented in the construction of green buildings in order to maximise the financial benefits provided by green buildings. The study showed that experts agreed that the concepts applied in green buildings lead to long-term financial savings which justifies the statement that a realistic comparison between the total costs of building green versus building conventional can only be achieved over the lifecycle of a building.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the liability for developmental faults in connection with single house construction. Background to the paper is the Myresjohus Case, T 99-12, that has attracted some public attention. The case concerned the liability for a number of single houses that were built with the construction method known as External thermal insulation composite system walls. The method is an example of a developmental fault.  Developmental faults are a kind of abstract faults. In legal terms develop-mental faults are defined as defects that have arisen despite that the work has been made in what is considered to be a professional way at the time of completion.  An important issue when assessing the liability is the mode of conveyance. If the land is sold separately, the rules of consumer construction contracts are applicable. If, on the contrary, the single house and the land are sold together, the rules in the Land Code come into force.  A construction is defective if it deviates from the professional standard, or from what has been agreed. The assessment shall be made according to the circumstances at the time of the inspection of the house. This is particularly interesting in the case of developmental faults, since the construction meth-ods often are poorly tested and the defects show up at a later stage.   Developmental faults in real estate seem to be a part of the seller\u00b4s responsi-bility; at least if the house on the property is new. This may be concluded from NJA 1997 s. 290, a Swedish Supreme Court ruling, where the court stated that single house buyers must, especially when the houses are new, be able to expect that the houses are generally functional and do not have any special defects that that make them less suited for accommodation.  The case is probably the contrary in consumer construction contract rela-tions. According to the preparatory work of the Consumer Services Act, developmental faults are not a part of the constructor\u00b4s liability. This view is shared by some voices in jurisprudence. It thus seems like that the purchaser cannot expect a flawless house in the same way as when the house is sold according to the rules in the Land Code. An important question to ask is whether this allocation of the liability is just and fair. Apparently the legisla-tor has given priority to the interests of the constructor on behalf of the con-sumer.   Good news under the circumstances is a newly published government in-quiry, SOU 2013:10, proposing a new kind of mandatory insurance that will among other things cover developmental faults. Are we in fact on our way of achieving a generally better consumer protection regarding developmental faults?", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1886650899"}}

These vertical shafts are located in underground caverns and they are for example elevatorand ventilation shafts. Shafts are usually couple dozens of meters deep. Engineer must think careful about the coming structures to these shafts and planning must take into account of work\u2019s ease, expenses and final quality. Also, man must think how the workers can practically reach the work site situated mostly high above without risking occupational safety.

With the help of cost comparison, writer found the most reasonable choices from the ensembles. This comparison made by comparing the ratio of expenses and construction times. Thesis also took notice in occupational safety of every examined methods. At the end of this thesis, the result was that the most reasonable structure is concrete block structure built from the single mast climbing work platform. Reasons for choosing this concrete block structure were the lowest construct price and short construction time. Reasons for choosing mast climbing work platform were low rent price, fast installationand disassembling time and worker friendly work ergonomics. With the help of gained results, the writer of this thesis recommends using of these methods chosen above in vertical underground shafts construction in Kivisydan-parking facility, although the results in these examined shafts aren\u2019t necessary valid in every different shafts.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1920508674"}}

Design/methodology/approach  A Delphi method survey was employed, for which 25 individuals from three key stakeholder groups of the Saudi housing sector participated. They were asked about their degree of agreement (or disagreement) about the various barriers and enablers of applying sustainability to housing construction in Saudi Arabia, which utilises smart technologies. This research paper must be considered as an indicative study of selected experts that do not represent in any way the total population of Saudi Arabia.  Findings  Lack of public awareness has been identified as the most significant barrier in implementing sustainable housing development in Saudi Arabia, which utilises smart technologies. Raising awareness of the public to the benefits of sustainable housing and enlightening key project stakeholders in the design of sustainable housing are both essential in order to overcome the barriers discussed in this paper.

LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) developed by the USGBC (United States Green Building Council), has provided a score sheet and rating system that can be applied to construction projects to determine if in fact a project can be LEED certified. The scoring sheet is the buildings report card, and the \u2018grades\u2019 on that report card are assessed and delivered from a third-party who is not initially involved in the construction of the project. This paper will discuss the process which was implemented in constructing the Social Science building on the campus of the University of North Florida, and the differences in costs savings by having a LEED certification.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2182341073"}}

I once attended a symposium on wind energy. At the meeting Jim Gordon, Cape Wind's president tossed out an unimaginable idea, a ground breaking future event that would produce free energy, energy so inexpensive we would have no regard for its cost.... Until then we need to pay attention. For years the LEED certification has been a coveted indication of the care and environmentally friendly manner in which a building has been newly constructed. LEED has done a wonderful job heightening the attention to sustainable building, however gaining in popularity is the Energy Star designation. Energy Star is a government program that quantifies relative energy usage based on the type of building being scored. It focuses on building operating costs, methods and systems employed in the buildings to achieve these costs. An OpEx less than 35% of normal building operations achieves the rating of Energy Star. The Energy Star service also goes beyond a one-time analysis and provides building owners and managers tools with which to continually analyze their buildings and include variables such as fuel sources and systems. There are many perspectives and priorities for building owners including public relations, political capital, upfront cost and operating cost. We are seeing far greater emphasis on the Energy Star rating now than we have in the past due to increased sensitivity to operating costs vs. building sustainability during planning and construction. If it costs less to run a building the NOI is going to be higher, thus increasing the building's value. LEED and Energy Star are both helping to move construction in the right direction but from two different approaches. (Here comes the editorial comment). For a bottom line operating analysis and building valuation perspective, Energy Star is the leading indicator. Energy Star also has a far greater impact and application for existing construction vs. new construction. From the perspective of what is good for the planet long term with less regard for the cost of construction and certification for new construction, LEED is your certification. Better yet, both.

Over the years there has been significant increase in the standard of living of the people around the globe due to rapid industrialization, and urbanization. However, these developments have also resulted in exploitation and overuse of natural resources, which are now hitting us back in the form of global warming, natural calamities and other tantamount effects. The word is slowly getting spread that we need to protect the environment so the quality of life for us and future generations does not deteriorate. To protect our Environment, the concept of Green Building has come in to picture which helps to reduce the pollution that is being produced from industries, automobiles, houses, pesticides, etc. However, lack of awareness on this technology, coupled with improper city planning, and complacency to provide support at the level of Government and local bodies has challenged for astute implementation of green technology. A Green Building is a sustainable building which is environmentally eco-friendly and resource efficient. Developed countries like USA, UK kick started to make people aware about this technology and provide aid for implementation through organizations like USGBC (United State Green Building Council), LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) and NAHB (National Authority of High Rise Buildings). In India, too, the task has been taken up through IGBC(Indian Green Building Council). The main aim of the Council is to reduce the pollution that emanates from houses and industries and seek for alternative renewable resources of energy for efficient use of building materials. In this research the process of point system for award of IGBC credits has been studied in detail and it was observed that the system is too complex for adoption for low and middle income group of houses in developing country environments like India and Nepal. Thus there is a need to review and suggest an encouraging system of categorizing the houses as Green Houses in developing country environment. In this research different factors like area, type of design, materials used have been included to come up with new plans and assignments of credits in a way that they can be achieved relatively easily. Also components like landscape, parking facilities, energy performance, grey water management, management of irrigation systems, credits have also been factored in so that certification as green building is made easy for new and existing low and middle income groups/class of houses to promote sustainable development in the near future", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2186465863"}}

In fact, most papers on the implementation of Lean concepts and principles in prefabricated building systems have focused on a particular stage of the construction process, such as design, prefabrication or assembly. This paper is concerned with planning and controlling engineer-to-order (ETO) prefabricated systems, in which a single company is responsible for designing, and prefabricating components, and assembling them on site. This paper reports the preliminary results of an ongoing research project that aims to understand how the assembly process at the construction site can pull the prefabrication of components in a context with high variability.

Cost management includes planning and control, and constructability1 and prefabrication construction are two main design economics factors for early cost planning decision. Despite the fact that constructability and prefabrication have been considered in design and cost planning, there is no guarantee if the intention meets the expectation. This requires on-going control during construction stage. In fact, prefabrication construction has been encouraged for some years, application is not always positive. One of the reasons is its constructability. This paper investigates the appropriate research methodology to determine how design for prefabrication and constructability will contribute to cost planning through control and review during construction stage. Through a study of an Australian residential project using prefabrication in structural concrete, internal partitioning and internal fit-out, this research concludes that case study is a viable choice. Prefabrication construction does provide a positive impact on the major project objectives: time, cost and quality. Cost reduction is due to saving in time related preliminaries as a direct result of time reduction of onsite activities whilst quality is ensured due to better control of prefabricated components inside the factories. However, it can only be achieved after considering constructability: suitable materials choice, design for available skills, use of available plant, and clear communication. The keys are through plan at design phase and control in construction stage.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2249290221"}}

Recently, the Malaysian government focused on delivering more number of affordable public and private housing units to the middle-income population. With the global awareness on sustainability, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether environmentally-sustainable design elements in housing design can be integrated within the affordable range of this target group. The research followed the basic three methodological steps namely data collection, data analysis and data interpretation. Secondary data was collected from literature in order to identify all possible sustainable design elements related to the context including both passive and active elements. Seventeen passive and two active elements were identified. After that, they were put together and were divided into two different categories. The first category included those which were within the designers\u2019 control and were expected to be integrated within the design process with affordability entrusted with the designers. The second category included those which remain to be within this targeted owners\u2019 decision to choose from, depending on their affordability. From analysis, fifteen passive elements were drawn into the first category, and two passive and two active elements were included in the second category. Afterwards, a market study which included interviews with contractors and manufacturers, were conducted in order to determine the market price of each of these elements. A five-point Likert-scale questionnaire survey was conducted through conditional sampling (sample size: twenty) in order to test opinions of the target group on these four elements regarding affordability. It was found that only one of them namely solar water heating system was within their affordable range. Totally, sixteen elements were found to be affordable by this target group.

The participants of the study are the personnel of Green Energy Design Studio Sdn Bhd. There are three consultants managing various projects with working experience ranging from one to five years. A semi-structured interview was conducted with each of the participant individually as part of the data collection process. The interview was then transcribed and phenomenological analysis was conducted to identify the significant statements that provides insight to addressing the research objectives. From the interviews, the participants clarified the green building constructions process and it was found that this process is similar to those of traditional buildings. However, there are new elements introduced to meet the additional requirements for green building certification. These new elements occur in paralles to the existing process and do not present a major stumbling block to the project scheduel. The analysis of the data then provided three themes for delay factors. They are commercial, knowledge and people. Each of these theme have various factors associated with it and each of the factors is explained and discussed in detail.

The overall goals of this dissertation are to investigate the sustainability of the built environment, holistically, by assessing its Triple Bottom Line (TBL): environmental, economic, and social impacts, as well as propose cost-effective, socially acceptable, and environmentally benign policies using several decision support models. This research is anticipated to transform life cycle assessment (LCA) of the built environment by using a TBL framework, integrated with economic input-output analysis, simulation, and multicriteria optimization tools. The major objectives of the outlined research are to (1) build a system-based TBL sustainability assessment framework for the sustainable built environment, by (a) advancing a national TBL-LCA model which is not available for the United States of America; (b) extending the integrated sustainability framework through environmental, economic, and social sustainability indicators; and (2) develop a systembased analysis toolbox for sustainable decisions including Monte Carlo simulation and multi-criteria compromise programming. When analyzing the total sustainability impacts by each U.S. construction sector, \u201cResidential Permanent Single and Multi-Family Structures and Other Non-residential Structures are found to have the highest environmental, economic, and social impacts compared to other construction sectors. The analysis results also show that indirect suppliers of construction sectors have the largest sustainability impacts compared to onsite activities. For example, for all U.S. construction sectors, on-site construction processes are found to be responsible for less than 5 % of total water consumption, whereas about 95 iv % of total water use can be attributed to indirect suppliers. In addition, Scope 3 emissions are responsible for the highest carbon emissions compared to Scope 1 and 2. Therefore, using narrowly defined system boundaries by ignoring supply chain-related impacts can result in underestimation of TBL sustainability impacts of the U.S. construction industry. Residential buildings have higher shares in the most of the sustainability impact categories compared to other construction sectors. Analysis results revealed that construction phase, electricity use, and commuting played important role in much of the sustainability impact categories. Natural gas and electricity consumption accounted for 72% and 78% of the total energy consumed in the U.S. residential buildings. Also, the electricity use was the most dominant component of the environmental impacts with more than 50% of greenhouse gases emitted and energy used through all life stages. Furthermore, electricity generation was responsible for 60% of the total water withdrawal of residential buildings, which was even greater than the direct water consumption in residential buildings. In addition, construction phase had the largest share in income category with 60% of the total income generated through residential building\u2019s life cycle.

Comparative analyses of worldwide AIA design processes revealed that the domestic design process only reflected design factors, excluding mechanical and facility-related factors, out of the assessment items for Green Building certifications; this is because the domestic process is done mainly on a basis of drawings and specifications.

The degree to which the design of a building embraces maintenance considerations has a major impact on its performance. In Malaysia for instance, most designers claimed to have knowledge and experience on building maintenance aspects but only few are aware of the importance to consider maintenance factors during design stage. A survey was carried out on 37 designer firms (architectural, civil & structural consultant firms) and 31 maintenance firms located in Shah Alam and Kuala Lumpur. The aim was to find out the building defects and other maintenance problems that are heavily attributed to design deficiencies, inadequate information gathering, material limitations and lack of maintenance knowledge. The data were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package of Social Sciences). Findings show that main problems that the maintenance firms are currently facing are caused by building design deficiencies, poor construction quality and poor performance of building which is directly related to functional layout, choice of building material and choice of building equipment. It appears that designer firms consider maintenance factors like ease of cleaning, access to cleaning area and repair and replacement to be the least important when designing buildings. Lack of communication between designer firms and maintenance firms as well as building users or owners resulted in designer firms not fully aware of the maintenance-related problems frequently reported by building owners. Designers seem to be neglecting the benefits of designing for ease of maintenance that can prolong the building lifespan, reduce defects rate and therefore reduce maintenance costs. Therefore, it is important for project team management to develop awareness and policy from the very early start of project to ensure the concept for ease of maintenance can be understood and implemented successfully in local construction practice.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2626493202"}}

Background: As the negative environmental impact of buildings has been revealed in thesustainability debate, a concept called \u201cgreen building\u201d has begun to develop. Building greencreates more resource efficient models for building and aim at reducing the negativeenvironmental impact of buildings regarding energy consumption, environment and the humanhealth. Green housing is being analysed from a stakeholder perspective with focus on greenmarketing, which includes a holistic way of marketing. A problem with marketing greenproducts such as environmentally sustainable buildings is that consumers do not alwaysunderstand the importance of choosing the environmentally friendly option. The outcome ofpeople\u2019s choice whether to invest or not largely depends on how the issue is communicated. Building green can benefit a majority of stakeholders in the building industry as well as otherstakeholders in the society both from an economical, social and environmental perspective.Purpose: The purpose of our study is to map out and analyse different stakeholdersperspectives regarding green housing.

Different stakeholders refer to different green market conditions and green marketing arguments regarding green housing. The study indicatesthat the relatively high initial cost for green housing combined with todays lack of knowledgeregarding these houses create a certain hesitation among potential stakeholders when it comesto investing in green housing. Our study has lead to several conclusions concerning theimportance of communicating knowledge and additional value via green marketing. The lack ofknowledge has been established as the main problem that needs to be adjusted to enable thefuture development of the market and cooperation between stakeholders is lifted as an approachto successfully accomplish this development.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W630339444"}}

The paper will first study and compare both the BASIX and BEAM Plus assessment systems. Second, the advantages and pitfalls of the mandatory and voluntary approaches will be identified and discussed. The paper is based on desk research. The impacts of the environmental policy tools, determined through case studies that will be conducted, should reveal if a voluntary-with-incentives approach is the stronger motivation for the building industry to improve its environmental performance.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W634816162"}}

The Advisory Committee on Measuring Innovation in 21st Century Economy (2008), defined innovation as the design, invention, development, and/or implementation of new or altered products, services, processes, systems, organizational structures, or business models for purpose of creating new value for customers and financial returns for firm (Santolaria et al., 2011). In that way, eco-design considering life cycle of products, processes or services, plays a fundamental role in innovation driven companies, adding a sustainable value to strategy of firm. In this paper results of a research concerning eco-design strategies are presented. The Italian medium size company in partnership with Architecture and Design Department of Politecnico di Torino undertook research which aim is environmental improvement of building materials and products. Therefore, LCA method is been applied as a tool for integrating environmental criteria into strategic plans in order to: - evaluate environmental impacts; - improve brand value on market; - fulfill client demand; - make products more fashionable; - integrate eco-design into energy efficiency construction sector. A case study proposed in this paper shows a LCA-based analysis applied to a thermal plaster from different perspective of whole life cycle stages, including: row materials suppliers, manufacturing companies, building designers, installation company, end-user and end-of-life business. The main goal, from all project partners points of view, is development of an innovating product characterized by combination of: low environmental impacts of production, high market competitiveness (in price, energy efficiency, installation features, etc.) and long expected service life. In particular, two different analysis are carried out to promote both environmental benefits and industrial feasibility. LCA methodology is applied to develop and improve a range of experimental prototypes of thermal plaster using natural material as a primary source including minerals and plants, often derived from agriculture by-products or scraps. This first step can be helpful for industrial partner to evaluate environmental impacts of each plaster blend as well as assessing and optimizing every manufacturing process to formulate a final product that follows appropriate eco-design criteria in terms of energy and environmental impact and cost. A second step of study concerns comparison between existing thermal plasters with eco-innovating product coming from former analysis. In this context, Life Cycle Assessment methodology can be applied to eco-design to promote circular economy and influencing decision makers towards sustainable choices. As a result, interlinked local companies can share by-products and process scraps to reduce environmental impact and support eco-innovation", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W962411803"}}

This study aims to suggest ways to improve sustainability on housing complexes. This study sampled eight housing projects in Seoul and GyeongGi-Do in Korea, which were completed in June 2007 and June 2008. Then, are retention and maintenance on \"constructed greens for ecological environment\" including \"green structures substitutes retaining walls\", \"green roofs\", and \"green walls.\" Study methods are field investigations of the sampled sites, and Post Occupancy Analysis. Major findings were; 1) \"constructed greens\" are not well retained in more sites and and this implies the GBCS(Green Building Certification System) does not meet its objectives well, 2) User showed lower user satisfaction to \"constructed greens\". User satisfaction concerning \"green structures substitute retaining walls\" was higher than the satisfaction on the other constructed green type. Satisfaction Assessment Criteria lower 1han average were \"level of quality\", \"meet the design objectives\", \"vegetation management status\", \"vegetation maintenance\". 3) User satisfaction was strongly correlated on the level of quality factor of \"constructed green\". In addition, tue other factors are the significant correlations between the satisfactions. The present GBCS has inadequate assessment standards for maintenance, which lead to lower the entire satisfaction. Therefore, periodic recertification system, education and information providing for the managing personals, and incentives for good maintenance or disincentive for poor maintenance of the \"constructed greens\" are suggested to improve the GBCS.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2055097765"}}

Humanity is facing a number of serious issues associated with increased energy consumption and environmental pollution. Various studies/guidelines concerning sustainable building construction have suggested solutions to these disastrous problems, including: net-zero energy buildings, the green building certification system, and others. Sustainability pursues three expected effects: environmental, social, and economic merits. Korean Green Building Council (K-GBC) has also announced the Korean Green Building Certification System (K-GBCS) since 2003 based on sustainability. Some positive social and environmental aspects of the K-GBCS have already been reported. However, it is somewhat difficult to verify its economic merits, which are crucial to ensuring the validity of the K-GBCS. This research aims to verify the economic merits of the eco-friendly Korean-style condominiums accredited by K-GBCS. Following this, the expected economic effectiveness of K-GBCS will be examined in terms of sustainability. The underlying assumption is that the potential economic effect should reflect the actual economic merits, and should reflect the value of the housing in particular. According to the analysis of the variance, it can be concluded the value of green certified buildings is statistically higher than the value of non-certified buildings. Furthermore, it was also observed that this tendency was more dominant in Gyeonggi Province than in the City of Seoul. This may be caused by one of the variables: the proximity to downtown. In future studies, this variable should be studied in greater detail.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2033998577"}}

A comparative analysis of several existing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) databases of building materials has been made. It showed that building assessments using different LCA databases as sources can vary considerably, and a localised, unified database needs to be set up.

The environmental topics debated globally have changed from passive discussions about environmental protection and energy consumption to more proactive dialogues on sustainable cycles and LOHAS. Taiwan has actively proposed relevant environmental responsive measures, including plans for ecological cities, green buildings, and green building materials (GBMs). GBMs are the basic factor of environmental building projects and they have the most extensive scope of applications, as they have a direct effect on human health and are the key to the Earth\u2019s sustainability. This research summarized international sustainability assessment systems, international green building material labels, and relevant building material assessment mechanisms, in order to summarize and integrate a variety of factors with the life cyclic assessment (LCA) of the ISO14040 series as the axis for establishing a preliminary green building material assessment system. In addition, the Fuzzy Delphi Methods was employed for analysis to discuss the green building material environmental load (Ln) factor and the green building material quality (Qn) factor. According to the research and analysis results, this research established the GBM Eco-Efficiency Assessment System in the context of climate change, to be used as the basis for subsequent research on GBM eco-efficiency standards.

A forensic investigation of the alleged damage, and in particular, the cause and the extent of the damage and a determination of new versus pre-existing damage after the construction has begun, or after it has been completed, can be challenging.

Several factors lead to the building undermining and failure, including design and construction errors.

This methodology was then used as the basis for a tool that has been developed \u2013 Sakura, 1 to demonstrate the case for design for deconstruction within specific building design projects. A literature review of work relating to material reuse and recycling was undertaken, from this it has been suggested that the most appropriate way to deal with reused materials is to share the environmental impacts of them between the number of predicted lives. The LCA method for Sakura, boundaries and functional units are also outlined. The methodology was applied to a representative building, in a simplified LCA study; different ways of representing the output are discussed, with a comparative graph decided as the best option to represent the benefits of design for deconstruction.

Abstract This article explores the notion of the Zero Waste City , which takes the concept of sustainable cities further to optimize all urban material flows toward 100% resource recovery and reuse of building components and materials. The construction sector uses a huge amount of raw materials and has high inefficiencies, eg, material and energy inefficiencies. Implementing material efficiency in the construction sector requires a change in how materials are approached throughout the supply chain. What is required is transformative change at a systemic level toward sustainable consumption, shifting people from being merely consumers to responsible citizens. Therefore, this article argues that influencing values and behavior is an important, but often neglected, part of a low carbon urban future. This includes starting a transition phase of reduced, decoupled consumption, eg, using products and buildings for longer, producing more durable products that take advantage of prefabrication, modularity, adaptability, and durability.

In the current maintenance system of building, safety inspection and precise safety diagnosis have been applied only for Type 1 and 2 buildings. Considering the fact that middle and small-size buildings take up 99.4% of total buildings, it is necessary to implement safety diagnosis for the buildings to make long lasting buildings. This study suggested improvement methods for adjusting the existing evaluation items to middle and small-size buildings by reviewing the current diagnosis system and a survey. Based on the methods, an improved model, which modified the existing diagnosis model, was developed by applying fuzzy theory. If the improved model of this study is applied on site, the buildings except Type 1 and 2 could be maintained constantly. In the future studies, it is necessary to implement the developed model practically, to strengthen the feasibility of the model.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2005291967"}}

Climate change adaptation will require shifts from current practices and demands, adjustments to the carbon-dependent economy, and even a transformation of our fundamental values. Not surprisingly, the public dialogue on climate change adaptation has turned to building practices in response to evidence of the overwhelming pressure that today\u2019s buildings place on energy and natural resource supplies. Through green building practices, we seek to address building design, construction, and operation in a comprehensive manner to reduce the overall environmental impact of the built environment, increase the efficiency of energy, water, and other resource use, and reduce waste, pollution, and environmental degradation. In large part, green building practices diverge from conventional building codes by identifying standards of acceptable building performance (rather than set design measurements) and make an accounting for the life cycle of materials that comprise the structure. This essay explores strategies for adapting the building sector to climate change through the use of green building practices. The aspects of green building that are explored in this research include the use of sustainable building practices through the implementation of building efficiency standards, such as Energy Star and the U.S. Green Building Council\u2019s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), and the incorporation of resource efficiency into all stages of the building process. This essay emphasizes the need for regional building priorities in building practices, as locational demands may make require particular adaptive demands on buildings.

ABSTRACT Green building construction is earning a place in Singapore's construction industry, and, with augmenting cognizance of environmental issues and growing concern over climate change, sustainable construction is gradually being put forth globally. However, construction of green buildings in Singapore still encounters impediments, as there is a lack of proper project management framework for such projects. Based on survey and interview results from 31 industry experts, this study aims to identify common obstacles encountered during management of green construction projects, ultimately proposing some solutions to overcome the barriers. The findings from this study reveal that, although project cost is the paramount barrier among others in green building construction management, there is no paucity in sustainable knowledge in Singapore's construction industry. To deal with the cost related problem, the coverage of government incentives should be widened to include the usage of green products and technologies. Furthermore, a project management framework for green building construction should be developed to overcome the barriers, possibly promoting adoption of sustainable construction in future projects.

In this study detailed embodied energy and cost data for three commercial buildings were obtained for two countries, China and New Zealand. The results suggested some correlation between embodied energy and the cost of individual building components for each building, as well as a correlation between the total embodied energy and the cost of the buildings. The research took both the embodied energy incurred by labour and cost of labour into consideration. These two factors were shown to be important components of the analysis that cannot be neglected.

ABSTRACT Despite the surge of interest in construction sustainability, the rate of construction recycling is still trailing behind that of other industries. Extensive recycling, for instance, is limited to a few types of construction material. This paper analyzes recycling situations across the United States (US) and identifies common obstacles to recycling in the context of the US construction industry. Through a set of interviews with industry practitioners, obstacles are classified into six factors: social, environmental, economic, material, participant and regional. The obstacles are then tested on a recently demolished building in the San Antonio, TX, area, and compared with a hypothetical scenario in San Diego, CA. The study found that designers, and contractors (to a lesser extent), play a crucial role in achieving higher recycling rates. Specific practices that designers can use include collecting information on materials lifetime and recyclability in the region, reducing the number of materials used and component sizes, using two\u2010stage building systems and recording changes during construction and operation.

This thesis analyzes the influence of construction materials during the life-cycle energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of medium sized institutional buildings in Venezuela. A Historical archive and research with 2,629 m\u00b2 of construction in the center of El Tocuyo, Venezuela, city with a tropical dry climate was designed. In order to develop this analysis, four alternatives of this building were designed: a concrete building, where the majority of the construction materials are made of cement or concrete, a timber building, where most of the construction materials are made of timber / wood. Continuously, a building made with metallic construction materials was analyzed and a fourth building with a selection of local materials. AH these materials were divided into six major components (structure, external facade, interior design, windows, louvers and external pavement) in order to analyze separately the influence of each one of the components. All the materials that were selected for this analysis correspond to construction materials inside the Venezuelan market and that are often used in the construction of this country. Subsequently, to determine the influence of the construction materials, the analysis have been assessed over four main stages; energy consumption and CO2 emissions by operation during the life-cycle (60 years) of the buildings, energy consumption and CO2 emissions during the production of construction materials (initial and recurrent embodied energy and CO2 emissions), energy consumption and CO2 emissions produced by the transport of construction materials, finally, energy and CO2 emissions which could be recovered during the recycling of these materials (EoL potential). Design Builder software was used to calculate the operational energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the buildings while CES eco-audit (2011) software was used to calculate the other three stages. The results of this thesis determined that the total embodied energy (initial and recurrent embodied energy) of construction materials is among 18 % and 32 %, the energy consumed by the transport of these materials is between 0.2 % and 0.6 %, while the operating energy consumption represents between 68 % and 82 % of the total energy consumption during the life-cycle of the buildings. Beside this, the CO2 emissions results show that the trends are practically equal to those of the energy consumption results. On the other hand, the analysis conducted in this thesis relating to the potential of recycling construction materials, has determined that from 17 % to 63 % of the embodied energy and CO2 emissions of these materials could be reduced. To conclude, with this analysis it was established that the construction materials represent a significant influence on the total energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the buildings subject to analysis. The difference between the buildings with lower and higher total embodied energy and CO2 (including transport) during the life-cycle of these is equivalent of 17.4 years of operating energy consumption and 17 years of operating CO2 emissions.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1527424222"}}

The data were then statistically analyzed using a t-test analysis, a Pearson\u2019s parametric correlation, and a chi-square test. The research reveals that clients detect more defects in flats than in detached houses. The lower quality of the materials used in flats and the tighter schedule to which flats are subject may cause these differences.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1997258581"}}

As a result of excessive construction and development, the earth environment has severely deteriorated. Based on the data from Architecture and Building Research Institute, Ministry of the Interior, the amount of CO2 emissions of the construction industry has exceeded one quarter of the national total. The CO2 emission distribution is 9.31% for building materials production, 0.2% for construction, 1.49% for materials transportation, 11.88% for residential daily energy use and 5.94% for commercial daily energy use with a total of 28.82%. It can be seen that the residential buildings play a key role on energy saving and CO2 emission reduction policy. Although, at present, new residential buildings over 50 million NT dollars are required to execute green architecture design to conform to the green architecture labelling system based on the related building regulations, the government policy of green architecture on residential buildings has been more or less passive. For the general residential buildings built earlier and newly built, the government is not yet to require them to comply with the green architecture labelling system. Therefore, it may influence the promotion of energy saving and carbon dioxide emission reduction policy. The green architecture development of residential buildings is influenced by a lot of criteria. By studying those criteria, the most easily implemented or most cost effective criteria can then be applied to them. This research tries to establish a assessing framework for applying green architecture to residential building development. This research first, through literature reviews and and expert interviews, determines the criteria and sub-criteria to be used in the initial assessing framework. Then, through expert questionnaires, the Delphi method is used to finalize the assessing framework. Finally, the Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) is used to identify the relative weights of criteria and sub-criteria. From the relative weights of criteria, the building materials criterion has the greatest impact on the application of green architecture to residential building development. The priority weights of sub-criteria can help us understand when to apply those sub-criteria. In gerneral, the sub-criteria with high priority weights can be immediately implemented in the existing and newly built residential buildings and the sub-criteria with low priority weights should be implemented in the design stage.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1974631256"}}

The number of the projects considering domestic and foreign green buildings certification continually have been growing by increasing important on the environmental issues. Especially, LEED developed by USGBC(U.S Green Building Council) among the global green building certifications is a cosmopolitanly applicable system that is implemented by 103 countries. Internationally, according to increase the demand of LEED certification, the U.S. Government and sustainable consulting companies have conducted a study on additional cost impact for obtaining the LEED certification, and massive informations on LEED Cost are retained. In Korea, the demand of information on LEED cost added through LEED certification is rising according to the increase in the number of LEED projects, However the data of LEED cost reflected on construction market and conditions of the Korea are insufficient. Therefore, this study draw LEED cost data on additional construction cost of graded LEED certification through performance improvement and design changes of office building in Korea.

The Adoption of Industrialised Building System (IBS) Construction in Malaysia: The History, Policies, Experiences and Lesson Learned Mohd Idrus Din, Noraini Bahri, Mohd Azmi Dzulkifly, Mohd Rizal Norman, Kamarul Anuar Mohamad Kamar, Zuhairi Abd Hamid Abstract: Purpose Industry and government in Malaysia coined the term industrialised building system (IBS) to describe the adoption of construction industrialisation, mechanisation, and the use of prefabrication of components in building construction. IBS consists of precast component systems, fabricated steel structures, innovative mould systems, modular block systems, and prefabricated timber structures as construction components. Parts of the building that are repetitive but difficult \u0096 and too time consuming and labour intensive to be casted onsite \u0096 are designed and detailed as standardised components at the factory and are then brought to the site to be assembled. The construction industry in Malaysia has started to embrace IBS as a method of attaining better construction quality and productivity, reducing risks related to occupational safety and health, alleviating issues for skilled workers and dependency on manual foreign labour, and achieving the ultimate goal of reducing the overall cost of construction. The chronology of IBS-adoption in Malaysia goes back a long way, reaching back to the 1960s, when precast elements were adopted in the building industry to address the problem of an acute housing shortage. However, the introduction of IBS was never sustained beyond this period. As a result of the failure of early closed-fabricated systems, the industry is now avoiding changing its construction method to IBS. Some of the foreign systems that were introduced during the late 1960s and 1970s were also found to be unsuitable in Malaysia\u0092s climate and not very compatible with social practices. IBS has regained its popularity presently due to problems with construction workforces where the industry has been relying for a long time on unskilled workers from neighbouring countries. Method In 1999, the IBS Strategic Plan was launched to promote the system\u0092s usage in the industry. This was followed by the IBS Roadmap 2003-2010 and IBS Roadmap 2011-2015; these are blueprints for industrialised construction by 2015. The roadmaps have been developed by the government to chart progress and guide the awareness programmes, incentives, vendor scheme development, training, quality control and research and development programmes. The government also took the lead in 2008, by mandating that all public-sector projects must attain no less than 70% IBS-content under the Treasury Circular SPP 07/2008. This policy aims to build up momentum and to establish demand for IBScomponents, thus bringing the cost down. Results & Discussion At present, IBS-construction is widely used as a mainstream method and the implementation has moved from prefabrication towards mechanisation, automation, and robotics applications. This paper highlights some of the history, policies, experiences, and lesson learned in adopting IBS in Malaysia. The outlook for IBS-implementation in Malaysia is bright, but much work is still needed from the government to convince the contractors, manufacturers, and suppliers to adopt IBS-construction.

This paper examines the factors affecting the implementation of green buildings for the local construction industry. Questionnaire surveys and structural interviews were conducted to investigate the economical and social factors in the implementation of green buildings. From the survey results, the industry strongly believes that green building implementation is environment-friendly and can improve social values to the consumers. However, material costs, construction and transportation for green materials and green building features are more expensive than those for the conventional buildings. Four major factors affecting the existing limited implementation of green buildings were also discussed. Recommendations to improve the implementation of green buildings were also explored. This study can bring insights locally and around the world on how green buildings can be implemented to achieve environment-friendly, long-term cost saving and being recognized by the society and the consumers to reduce difficulties and burden encountered in the implementation.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4381480295"}}

Purpose One of the most critical contemporary issues is achieving and maintaining sustainable development, adapting the use of natural resources to provide for the needs of our rising populations without threatening the survival and quality of life for future generations. Sustainable construction, in particular, is a concept that is gaining importance all over the world and is gradually improving life for populations that recognize its importance. The current environmental degradation in Lebanon due to limited natural resources, population increases, and inefficient urban management, threatens the economic growth and the wellbeing of the people and thus dictates the urgent need for planning and taking action on a comprehensive environmental sustainability strategy. The main purpose of this research is to explore the Lebanese construction industry in order to evaluate sustainability achievements on both design and construction levels. This research also studies sustainability standards and practices implemented in some developed countries and in the surrounding region in order to better assess the current status of sustainability development and corresponding public awareness in the Lebanese construction market with respect to foreign industries. Based on the aforementioned, this research addresses challenges to sustainable construction in Lebanon and provides recommendations to enhance the use of energy-saving materials and the application of environmentally-friendly construction methods. Method This assessment is done through two complementary approaches: (i) a comprehensive literature review of all pertaining governmental regulations, public policy, and guidelines that have been enacted to promote building sustainability in Lebanon, as well as a survey about existing green buildings and ongoing green projects along with the implementation challenges; and (ii) conducting interviews with Lebanese parties that are key players in achieving sustainable development such as local experts, public agencies, municipalities, architectural and contracting firms, private agencies dealing with environment protection, and real-estate companies. Results & Discussion The concept of sustainable production and construction is still very primitive in Lebanon and the role of the government in promoting sustainability is not yet well established. Some public entities including, but not limited to, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Energy and Water, the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) have put some effort through internationally funded projects and campaigns by UNDP and the European Commission aimed at promoting sustainable production and consumption in Lebanon. However, these efforts were not enough to have a significant impact on these industries and resulted merely in voluntary guidelines rather than serious measures to reduce energy usage and pollution. Another finding of this research is that major efforts need to be made towards enhancing public awareness of sustainability issues. Hence, this research analyses the observed deficiencies in the Lebanese construction market and provides some recommendations that, if turned into action plans, constitute a promising transition from a short-sighted construction focusing on short-term goals of profit making and fast growth and lacking concern for the environment to a global long-term sustainable development that ensures the welfare of the current and future generations.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2159491206"}}

In 2009 a team from Kingston University led by Sayce was commissioned by the Ethical Property Foundation (EPF) to scope the possibility for developing a \u00ebmark\u00ed which would recognise that non-domestic properties, even though not necessarily of a specification which would allow them to gain a building certification such as BREEAM or LEED, could make a significant contribution to driving more sustainable behaviour in respect of how buildings are managed. The driver behind this was an increased realisation that building use is as important as building design and quality in achieving a range of environmental and social benefits. The results of that unpublished scoping study (Sayce et al.), combined with the views expressed in focused invited workshops, encouraged the EPF to further develop the notion. This paper will report on the initial, but more importantly, follow-up research work including interviews with a range of key industry stakeholders. The results have reinforced the need for a \u00ebmark\u00ed or \u00ebaward\u00ed that emphasises the social aspects of sustainability equally to the environmental. A Working Group of both EPF and industry and academic advisors, including the author has now developed a framework for an award. A further workshop to be held in March 2012 will help the Group to refine the criteria and prepare the scheme for a meaningful building mark which will neither replicate existing schemes such as BREEAM in Use (which relates to reduction of operational costs and environmental performance) nor require those seeking to achieve it to develop new streams of data. The paper will report on all steps of the research to date and moves towards the launch which is intended to take place no later than early 2013.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3125356882"}}

Evidence from Finland", "abstract": "Marketing green buildings - well structured process or forgotten minor detail? Evidence from Finland. Previous research has shown that buildings have a significant impact on the environment and small changes in their sustainability can create major improvements to the current environmental impact of the whole society (Eichholtz et al. 2009; Junnila 2004). The technology needed to build environmentally efficient buildings and the knowledge about their benefits is available, however, the ways of marketing these benefits to the public and customers and through this increasing the amount of green buildings, has not been a subject of much research. The aim of this article is to examine the current marketing situation of green buildings from a Finnish real estate developer\u00eds perspective and deepen the market\u00eds understanding on this subject. The theoretical part of the paper is conducted through an extensive literature study and for the empirical part; three different building development projects were examined. Great amounts of marketing material provided by the real estate developer were studied and interviews were made with their specialists on the green building field. Results indicate that the environmentally efficient characteristics of the buildings are not considered to be their major selling arguments but simply something that is expected in today\u00eds market and thus the green marketing actions of the real estate development company were quite ineffective and subtle. Based on the results of this study, it seems that at the moment, the marketing of green buildings lacks green ambition and not all are equally convinced about their differentiation potential. If the building market will end up in a situation where having a certification is enough in terms of being environmentally friendly, the development of a more sustainable built environment will fail, as no developer will be motivated to be innovative and more sustainable. However, by increasingly concentrating on the different benefits of green buildings and effectively communicating those to the customers, greenness can be made into a truly competitive marketing argument. The question is about being innovative and finding ways to compete differently than the competitors.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2235969975"}}

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a quantitative tool used to evaluate the environmental impacts of products or processes. With respect to buildings, LCA can be used to evaluate the environmental impacts of an entire building life cycle. Currently, LCA in the building area is used in a limited capacity, and primarily for selecting building products. In order to determine the causality for the lack of whole building LCAs, focus groups with members of the architecture, engineering, construction (AEC) communities were held. This research ascertains first the current level of knowledge of LCA in the AEC community and then discusses the benefits and barriers to the practice of LCA. From the focus group results, the most important benefit to LCA was: Provides information about environmental impacts. The results did not identify a prominent barrier; however, building-related metrics were ascertained to be one of the more crucial barriers. One limitation of LCA is the uncertainty associated with its results, which in this research is exemplified in the correlation between LCA and building energy models. In past research, results from energy models have been utilized to calculate life cycle operating energy of buildings in order to predict environmental impacts through LCA. Due to assumptions and variations between input data, past research has indicated substantial error rates in energy model results. In order to employ a life cycle perspective, the relationship between total life cycle energy use and energy modeling results has been studied. The main question guiding this research was: what is the acceptable error rate between predicted and actual life cycle energy use? Three different energy modeling programs with varying levels of detail were utilized to generate energy data for a case study, low energy home. EnergyPlus, Energy-10, and GBS all indicated error rates of 41%, 70%, and 20% respectively regarding life cycle primary energy consumption.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W59073454"}}

It reviews the challenges facing U.K. house-building business, maps conventional and emergent business models, and identifies factors capturing and creating value, centering on process and activities, risks, and finance. In the United Kingdom, house building is often decoupled from contracting, instead focusing on land acquisition, in response to the dominance of land-use planning. The competitive edge potentially available from technological innovation is often rendered less important or prevalent. However, exemplars do exist regarding incorporating off-site construction into house-building business strategy and adapting or creating business models to optimize such an approach.

Growing interest in Sustainable Architecture positioned the Green Building Certification at the center of great attention. They are outstanding in terms of providing clear codified standard which are comparatively easy in application. They have been developed through past decades with numerous upgrades in efforts to improve the system. However, with fast development of architectural environment, researches on the next generation rating system shall be continued to overcome the limits of current system. The purpose of this paper is to analyze LBC(Living Building Challenge) which will have key effects in terms of sustainability in the future. The primary characteristic of LBC is that: Firstly, it takes a top-down approach rather than bottom-up approach in defining the ideal or ultimate target. Secondly, it includes not only quantitative but also qualitative of sustainable aspects. Thirdly, it is not a design tool but a performance-based tool. Fourthly, it is not a checklist to earn credits, but it only consists of imperatives. Fifthly, it is a unified tool. Lastly, it considers the extended value such as urban context and regionality. Through understanding those characteristics, the followings are suggested: Firstly, an integrated tool shall be developed instead of a complex tool. Secondly, one shall consider not only quantitative but also qualitative value such as humanistic aspects to support a true sustainable human life. Thirdly, evaluation through auditing on-site after completing construction shall be intensified. Fourthly, diverse rating systems shall be developed in order to pursue different goals and philosophy. Conclusively, this paper is to support the next generation rating system such as LBC, to play the key role towards the development of true sustainable building.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1559991406"}}

There are many defect occurrences in building equipment system, because the components of the system runs consistently. This study aims at quality assurance and cost reduction of apartment houses by analyzing defect and suggesting improvement. Investigation was carried out by field diary paper of K construction companys customer support department. First, second and third year apartment houses after completion was subject to investigation, and the number of the apartment houses were 4,021. Investigation was performed about all parts of construction classification, but this study reports only about building equipment system. Assuming that defect occurrences ratio of first year apartment houses is 100%, its ratio of second and third year apartment houses are 89% and 26%. This means that many defects occur in first and second year after completion. Lots of defects occur at plumbing part, especially at joint of toilet and faucet appliance. Defect occurrences have to be reduced for improving the image and saving the additional construction cost of the company, and many skilled workers and high quality equipments are necessary for this purpose.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1508181775"}}

TAB(Testing, Adjusting, and Balancing) processes are very common in building construction for matching the designed conditions and the actual conditions of mechanical systems. The TAB process can verify the performance of mechanical system and make a building efficiently in energy consumption. TAB processes are used in private sector usually due to the demand of owner for increasing the value of the building. However in public sector, such as a government office building and a public office building, TAB processes are seldom performed. Therefore the main reasons of low adoption of TAB process are investigated and some modifications of rules and laws are suggested. The most important factor to promote the TAB process is the concern and the responsibility of a public officer who is in charge of the building construction project. And also it should be regulated regally by government. If building certification programs such as the green building certification and the energy efficiency rating and certification of buildings adopt the TAB process then it will be spread out rapidly.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1557213930"}}

At the end a proposal is given for the optimal organizational structure of the company. The basis of the study is found in the importance of precast building in the contemporary way of life. The increasing demands of energy and ecology, the need to reduce the stress of those involved in the construction process, the pace of building etc., are only some of the reasons which favour the construction of precast, timber frame buildings. In this context, we are referring exclusively to construction using precast elements (panel construction) with the maximum degree of readiness, which at the same time enables quick and good quality construction. However, the high level of readiness of the panels is also linked to an increase in the risks of production (the occurrence of faults and their consequences) which necessarily requires detailed analysis of the organizational system of the company. This study attempts to direct consideration towards the optimal organizational structure of a company dealing with constructing precast timber frame buildings, which on the one hand ensures production of the quality required, and on the other finds an optimal solution to the question of the organization of production, social relationships within the company, worker satisfaction etc. In the end this should result in optimization (increase) of profits.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2592568981"}}

Offsite construction has evolved as a panacea to dealing with the under-supply and poor quality in the current age construction industry. Several offsite techniques have been adopted by the construction sector. Although, different forms of offsite techniques have been around for a while but their uptake has been low in the Indian context. This paper presents the perceptions about offsite construction in India and highlights some of the barriers and drivers facing the Indian construction industry. The data was gathered through a survey of 17 high level managers from some of the largest stakeholder organizations of the construction sector in India.

To stop further depletion of fuel energy sources, sustainability has been implemented on a large scale in such institutional buildings as schools, colleges, universities. Green buildings are designed to reduce operating costs by reducing energy consumption, but literature has shown that green buildings can cost more than non-green buildings. In this study, data were collected on construction cost and schedule for 30 Green School Buildings (GSB) and 30 Non-Green School Buildings (NGSBs) of the Clark County School District (CCSD) in Nevada. Statistical tests were performed to determine whether there was a significant difference in construction cost and time of completion between a GSB and an NGSB project. The results showed that the construction cost per square feet of a GSB is significantly higher than that of NGSB.

The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and later adopted by the Canada Green Building Council (CaGBC), has been widely accepted by public and private owners. Nevertheless it has been proven that adherence to LEED requirements has various effects on construction worker performance and productivity, construction cost and schedule and the environment. As a result, this limits the extent to which industry professionals apply the LEED principles, and are faced with difficulties in selecting the credits to be implemented in LEED certified projects. Therefore, there is a growing need to improve the sustainable goals by optimizing the LEED credit selection process to gain higher efficiency and productivity, which would result in increased popularity among contractors and design consultants. It has been identified that each LEED credit would have a different impact on cost, schedule, environment and the construction productivity. A considerable amount of literature has been published regarding these impact areas and it is clear that the impact is different from each credit and each project. However, very little research has been carried out that considers the combined effect of the identified factors.

In a recent study, a modular building was studied in Coimbra and Lule\u00e5. It was shown that in terms of CO2 emissions, the Use Stage was the most harmful stage during the building life-cycle for Coimbra climate. Contrarily, in Lule\u00e5, it was the Product Stage, despite energy consumption being higher than Coimbra, due to the way electricity and heat are generated. In the present study, two structural systems are first compared for the Belgian house: steel frame and traditional masonry. A different life-cycle scenario is taken into account for the steel frame house for the three different locations, in which the monthly temperatures, energy mix, heating and cooling systems are defined.

ABSTRACT With rapid urbanization and industrialization, China is now facing a great challenge in meeting the soaring demand for new buildings and the corresponding energy consumption. Under such circumstances, the setting of a national standard on green buildings would be an effective way to respond. In fact, China has made significant progress in developing national green building standards. But such progress is not explicitly released to the international societies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to introduce such progress. China's green building efforts are first discussed in detail with the various provisions of the national indicator system. By conducting a comparison with other countries' green building standards, a critical analysis of such a national standard is presented. The comparison indicates benefits to be gained and challenges to be met, such as lack of indicators on responding climate change, lack of region\u2010specific indicators, lack of quantitative indicators, higher costs for receiving certification and lack of applying innovative green technologies. So, substantive revision is critically needed. The knowledge gained from Chinese efforts on green building indicators are valuable to both developed and developing nations seeking to implement sustainable development measures within their regulatory policies.

This paper develops a conceptual model which proposes that cooperation with construction stakeholders and customers is a mediator, necessary for apartment developers to realize environmental, economic and even competitive performance improvement through sustainable design practices. The paper examines the current practice situations of sustainable design, cooperation with construction stakeholders and customers as well as related performance improvement among Chinese apartment developers based on 92 questionnaires conducted by the authors. The mediation effects are further analysed through hierarchical regression analysis. Statistical results indicate that sustainable design should be further promoted by the Chinese governments and implemented by Chinese apartment developers. Policy implications are discussed to provide detailed suggestions on improving the cooperation with Chinese apartment developers and their construction stakeholders/customers. Such cooperation can help apartment developers to improve environmental, competitive and economic performance through sustainable design practices.

ABSTRACT International policies indicate the building sector as one of the most promising for sustainable development. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it has the greatest and cheapest potential for delivering significant greenhouse gas emission reduction. However, early experiences of sustainable construction have shown that both a social and a technical transition are required. Consequently, the changes in organizational aspects of firms involved in construction represent an urgent research theme. This paper investigates how inter\u2010firm relationships are changing as the sector moves towards green building. The organizational model between firms is described at the integration level with suppliers, the integration level between the general contractor and the design team, the degree of specialization of involved firms and their sustainability certifications. These features have been analyzed in case studies collecting data through interviews. This paper compares organizational aspects in traditional and green buildings. Results suggest that green buildings are associated with inter\u2010firm relationships of comakership with suppliers and with the design team, and with firms with a portfolio focused on sustainable projects. Finally, among the case studies, sustainability related certifications are scarcely related to the greenness level of the building.

Extended abstract In the Climate Change Act of 2008 the UK Government pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. As one step towards this, regulations are being introduced requiring all new buildings to be \u2018zero carbon\u2019 by 2019. These are defined as buildings which emit net zero carbon during their operational lifetime. However, in order to meet the 80% target it is necessary to reduce the carbon emitted during the whole life-cycle of buildings, including that emitted during the manufacture of materials and components, and during the processes of construction, refurbishment and demolition. These elements make up the \u2018embodied carbon\u2019 of the building. This paper reviews the existing European and UK standards, methodologies, databases and software tools for the estimation of embodied energy and carbon of buildings. While there is currently no legislation requiring the calculation of embodied energy in buildings, voluntary standards are being developed by the European Committee for Standardisation Technical Committee 350 (CEN/TC 350). Based on BS EN ISO 14040 and BS EN ISO 14044, these define a four stage process-based life cycle assessment method to calculate the embodied energy in construction, with a compulsory \u2018product\u2019 stage and optional further stages for \u2018construction\u2019, \u2018use\u2019 and \u2018end of life\u2019. A further voluntary specification for the assessment of the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of goods and services, PAS2050, was introduced in the UK in 2008. It too uses a process-based assessment the environmental impact of a building calculated through this method can therefore be seen as the sum of the environmental impacts of the products and processes that have created the building. Other Life Cycle Assessment methodologies have been developed in this area, including input-output (I-O) and hybrids of process and input-output. The environmental impact of a building defined by an input-output based assessment in contrast to that by a process-based method, is seen as a proportion of the total impacts of the different economic sectors which have created the building. The I-O approach therefore inherently assigns responsibility for environmental impacts to a particular industrial sector. Process-based methods are more specific to the construction product, and more accurate within the limited boundaries used. However they omit the supporting services necessary for construction, including finance, insurance, government and organisational administration and all related office buildings. While I-O assessment overcomes the problems with process assessment by considering a complete system boundary, the assumptions of homogeneity and proportionality in particular limit its use for comparison of impacts from individual products. For the purposes of designing a low embodied energy building, the I-O approach is too broad-brushed and generic to be helpful. The hybrid approaches attempt to overcome the limitations of both the process and the I-O methods. There is some existing embodied carbon and embodied energy data. However, due to the lack of current regulations and the inherent complexity and diversity of the area, the available data are varied in scope and application. There are three main sources of data: 1. There are several databases which include embodied energy and carbon of standard building materials and components. Some of these are construction sector-specific, while others contain more general product data. These provide data for the \u2018cradle to factory gate\u2019 phase of the embodied energy. Manufacturers are also starting to develop their own Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) which include this data, and several of these are publicly available.2. Both commercial and in-house software tools have been developed to calculate whole life-cycle embodied energy for buildings and infrastructure projects. This is known as \u2018cradle to grave\u2019 assessment.3. Detailed life cycle assessments of specific buildings, including housing developments and individual dwellings, have also been carried out by academic researchers. A review of the research literature shows a wide range for the calculated embodied energy. This range in reported figures is due to the use of diverse product data arrived at through different LCA methodologies, different boundaries and often for specific manufacturers, which are therefore non-comparable; different calculation methodologies for the LCA of the whole building; and different building construction and designs. Perhaps most crucially, in spite of the likelihood of an underestimation by current analysis methods, the results show that embodied energy and carbon of buildings can be a very significant absolute value, as well as an increasingly high proportion of the whole life energy and carbon. The existing databases and much of the literature provide data for the product stage (stage 1) of the process \u2013 that is for the embodied energy and carbon in the building materials. However there is less, very limited, data available for composite components such as windows, for services components and for innovative materials and products. There is also a particular shortage of data across the construction sector in the energy used and carbon emitted during transport to site (part of stage 1 in prEN 15804), stages 2 (construction), 3 (in use) and 4 (end of life). The commercial and in-house analysis tools also vary in the databases they use, in their LCA methods and in the boundaries assumed in analysis. Taking each of the missing calculations in turn, the calculation of the reduced impacts of transport to site of local construction materials will inform and support the European standard BS EN 15643 parts 3 and 4, which considers the social and economic sustainability of construction works. Some construction projects last for several years and have hundreds of workers on site carrying out energy intensive activities. The accurate prediction of energy use and carbon emissions during standard site operations for stage 2 of the life cycle is therefore a fundamental part of the calculation for whole life embodied energy. Separately the development of off-site construction systems has been heralded as a \u2018sustainable\u2019 solution; this can only be verified with the development of an accurate \u2018carbon costing\u2019 method for both on-site and off-site construction activities, enabling the accurate comparison of different techniques and materials. Furthermore there is a lack of general data on the carbon and energy savings to be made by site management operations such as reuse of subgrade rather than the import of new materials. While ongoing maintenance and repair can be considered as part of the operational energy requirements, as suggested by the Strategic Forum for Construction (SFfC) [15], the impacts of major retrofit and refurbishment works form part of stage 3 of the whole life embodied impacts of a building. A clear understanding of the service life of individual components is necessary for these to be calculated. Finally there is limited data on the energy used by demolition, reuse and recycling processes at the end of life of a building. While these may be less important for building types with a long expected lifetime such as UK housing, it is a key element of short expected lifespans such as stadia, where design approaches are often required to consider deconstruction and reuse of components. In conclusion, it is essential to measure the whole life embodied energy and carbon of buildings, as well as their operational energy and carbon emissions. The comprehensive development of a robust methodology, and a deeper understanding of its limitations, is a necessary prerequisite for this. Various initiatives to develop and collate data and tools and make them freely available are still in their infancy, and these should be encouraged by the construction industry. It is hoped that the forthcoming standardisation of EPDs should ensure that all manufacturers produce equivalent information for their products within a few years. However the diversity of products used within construction will mean that the LCA of individual buildings will remain complex. This review will guide the future development of a consistent and transparent database and software tool to calculate the embodied energy and carbon of buildings within the specific context of the UK. The research is being carried out as part of a project led by BLP Insurance, and with the support of the Technology Strategy Board and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). In the Climate Change Act of 2008 the UK Government pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. As one step towards this, regulations are being introduced requiring all new buildings to be \u2018zero carbon\u2019 by 2019. These are defined as buildings which emit net zero carbon during their operational lifetime. However, in order to meet the 80% target it is necessary to reduce the carbon emitted during the whole life-cycle of buildings, including that emitted during the processes of construction. These elements make up the \u2018embodied carbon\u2019 of the building. While there are no regulations yet in place to restrict embodied carbon, a number of different approaches have been made. There are several existing databases of embodied carbon and embodied energy. Most provide data for the material extraction and manufacturing only, the \u2018cradle to factory gate\u2019 phase. In addition to the databases, various software tools have been developed to calculate embodied energy and carbon of individual buildings. A third source of data comes from the research literature, in which individual life cycle analyses of buildings are reported. This paper provides a comprehensive review, comparing and assessing data sources, boundaries and methodologies. The paper concludes that the wide variations in these aspects produce incomparable results. It highlights the areas where existing data is reliable, and where new data and more precise methods are needed. This comprehensive review will guide the future development of a consistent and transparent database and software tool to calculate the embodied energy and carbon of buildings.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2169131964"}}

Over the world, social demands and concerns of energy and resource depletions and environmental conservation have resulted in many researches and applications on sustainable development and construction. In order to support these demands and concerns, international green building certification systems such as LEED(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and BREEAM(Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) were developed. In Korea, the green building certification system was introduced in 2000 and widely applied to all types of new buildings in order to induce the diffusion of sustainable buildings on May, 2010. This paper investigates the importance of assessment criteria on multi-unit apartment projects among certification rating systems using the AHP(Analytic Hierarchy Process) method and suggests a new direction on certification assessment standards. For applying the AHP method, the survey of staffs in green building certification consulting companies and architectural design companies was conducted via e-mail. As a result, criteria like energy, indoor environment, land use, pollution control, and ecological environment among 9 main ones turned out important on assessing green building certification at multi-unit apartment projects, while criteria like water resource, transportation, maintenance management, and material and resource did relatively unimportant.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2219532985"}}

In recent years, the problems resulting from unsustainable subdivision development have become significant problems in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR), Thailand. Numbers of government departments and agencies have tried to eliminate the problems by introducing the rating tools to encourage the higher sustainability levels of subdivision development in BMR, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment Monitoring Award (EIA-MA) and the Thai\u2019s Rating for Energy and Environmental Sustainability of New construction and major renovation (TREES-NC). However, the EIA-MA has included the neighbourhood designs in the assessment criteria, but this requirement applies to large projects only. Meanwhile, TREES-NC has focused only on large scale buildings such as condominiums, office buildings, and is not specific for subdivision neighbourhood designs. Recently, the new rating tool named \u201cRating for Subdivision Neighbourhood Sustainability Design (RSNSD)\u201d has been developed. Therefore, the validation process of RSNSD is still required. This paper aims to validate the new rating tool for subdivision neighbourhood design in BMR. The RSNSD has been validated by applying the rating tool to eight case study subdivisions. The result of RSNSD by data generated through surveying subdivisions will be compared to the existing results from the EIA-MA. The selected cases include of one \u201cExcellent Award\u201d, two \u201cVery Good Award\u201d, and five non-rated subdivision developments. This paper expects to prove the credibility of RSNSD before introducing to the real subdivision development practises. The RSNSD could be useful to encourage higher sustainability subdivision design level, and then protect the problems from further subdivision development in BMR.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W56360070"}}

Summary This study is based on the three types of residential buildings with framework structures in Beijing: concrete framework construction (CFC), light\u2010gauge steel framework construction (SFC), and wood framework construction (WFC). The analysis of the environmental load across the life cycle of the three types of buildings is conducted using life cycle assessment (LCA) according to the protocols of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14040/44. The functional unit is the three material building designs, which possess the same function and design plan, and are built in concrete, light\u2010gauge steel, and light frame wood, inclusive of their respective envelope materials. Throughout the investigation, the calculations of the environmental load data of materials, energy consumption, and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions are comprehensively assessed and compared. The study shows that over the life cycle, the energy consumption of CFC is almost the same as that of SFC, and each of them is approximately 30% higher than that of WFC. Building use, steel material production, cement production, gypsum board production, and material transport are the main construction activities related to the energy consumption; the net CO 2 emission of CFC is 44% higher than that of SFC and 49% higher than that of WFC. The main source of CO 2 emission is the use of electricity; its contributions to the net CO 2 emissions of WFC, SFC, and CFC are 67%, 64%, and 44%, respectively. The net CO 2 emissions in the transport category cannot be ignored, with proportions amounting to 8%, 12%, and 11% for WFC, SFC, and CFC, respectively.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2114157443"}}

While the complexity in design is being overcome by the availability and advances in structural analysis tools and readily advanced software, the design of these buildings are still reliant on minimum code requirements that yet to be validated in full scale. The involvement of the author in the design and construction planning of Burj Khalifa since its inception until its completion prompted the author to conceptually develop an extensive survey and real-time structural health monitoring program to validate all the fundamental assumptions mad for the design and construction planning of the tower. The Burj Khalifa Project is the tallest structure ever built by man; the tower is 828 meters tall and comprises of 162 floors above grade and 3 basement levels. Early integration of aerodynamic shaping and wind engineering played a major role in the architectural massing and design of this multi-use tower, where mitigating and taming the dynamic wind effects was one of the most important design criteria established at the onset of the project design. Understanding the structural and foundation system behaviors of the tower are the key fundamental drivers for the development and execution of a state-of-the-art survey and structural health monitoring (SHM) programs. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to discuss the execution of the survey and real-time structural health monitoring programs to confirm the structural behavioral response of the tower during construction stage and during its service life; the monitoring programs included 1) monitoring the tower's foundation system, 2) monitoring the foundation settlement, 3) measuring the strains of the tower vertical elements, 4) measuring the wall and column vertical shortening due to elastic, shrinkage and creep effects, 5) measuring the lateral displacement of the tower under its own gravity loads (including asymmetrical effects) resulting from immediate elastic and long term creep effects, 6) measuring the building lateral movements and dynamic characteristic in real time during construction, 7) measuring the building displacements, accelerations, dynamic characteristics, and structural behavior in real time under building permanent conditions, 8) and monitoring the Pinnacle dynamic behavior and fatigue characteristics. This extensive SHM program has resulted in extensive insight into the structural response of the tower, allowed control the construction process, allowed for the evaluation of the structural response in effective and immediate manner and it allowed for immediate correlation between the measured and the predicted behavior. The survey and SHM programs developed for Burj Khalifa will with no doubt pioneer the use of new survey techniques and the execution of new SHM program concepts as part of the fundamental design of building structures.

The green building or green architecture has come to light as a strong architectural movement at the end of 1990's and as a main trend in architectural practice. The architectural green is a modern architectural philosophy which deals with the competent relationship between the functional constructive systems and its vital environmental, by controlling the inputs and outputs of this system with the least negative effects on the environment and occupant's health, and the least energy consumption during the various stages of the building ( construction, operation, maintenance and destruction ) to achieve the functional activities and the inventive and efficient architectural structures. The importance of this movement lies in trying to achieve the sustainable development in its environmental, social and economic aspects because of the problems that developed and developing countries ( e.g. Iraq ) face such as energy consumption and pollution. Several international standards of different classifications, depending on local context of each country, has been appeared. Some of these tools are (BREEAM, LEED, CO-CHPS Colorado, GBTool, CASBEE) which aim to assess the performance of the building from green Architecture's perspective. Although there is a similarity in the classification levels including the sustainable location, how to use (water, energy and atmosphere, materials, resources) effectively, indoor environment quality and the design's innovation, they differ in other aspects that its importance relies on the environmental and local context. The problem of our research was the absence of the practical evaluation tool of the green building ( school buildings ) for the Iraq's local context in general and Mosul in particular, compatibly with the city climate. The research aims at making theoretical construction to identify the assessment indicators of the school buildings from green architecture's perspective, in order to create suitable and general assessment tool for schools building in Mosul city which can help improving the performance of these schools, decreasing the effect on the health, sparing energy coasts, and other benefits in the stages of the project ( pre-construction, construction, post-construction ).

Building certification systems have facilitated the spread and adoption of green building practices. Today, a diverse collection of certification systems is being created and implemented around the globe. While these certification systems identify buildings that were designed to be energy efficient, a number of criticisms have called attention to the variation of actual energy performance from predicted energy performance of certified buildings, questioning their legitimacy. In this paper, we examined the post-certification processes that eleven building certification systems use to account for the operational performance of certified buildings. We found that most certification systems have decoupled new building certification from existing building certification, and problems arise when there is no routine process to transition from one to the other. We identify recertification as a best practice in facilitating this transition, thus ensuring the continual energy efficiency of certified buildings.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2560332020"}}

Among the many advantages of green buildings and the application of the International Green Construction Codes (IgCCs) is increased productivity, improved tenant/employee health, and increased recruitment and retention capabilities. Likewise, green buildings offer numerous other benefits, both direct such as increased property values and increased marketability and indirect benefits such as enhanced image and reducing potential risks. Life-Cycle Costing and Analysis is examined and the necessary steps needed to perform an accurate analysis are discussed. Builders and manufacturers incentives, as well as federal, business, and consumer tax incentives are highlighted.

However, the EIA-MA has included the neighbourhood designs in the assessment criteria, but this requirement applies to large projects only. Meanwhile, TREES-NC has focused only on large scale buildings such as condominiums, office buildings, and is not specific for subdivision neighbourhood designs. Recently, the new rating tool named Rating for Sustainable Subdivision Neighbourhood Design (RSSND) has been developed. Therefore, the validation process of RSSND is still required. This paper aims to validate the new rating tool for subdivision neighbourhood design in BMR. The RSSND has been validated by applying the rating tool to eight case study subdivisions. The result of RSSND by data generated through surveying subdivisions will be compared to the existing results from the EIA-MA. The selected cases include of one Excellent Award, two Very Good Award, and five non-rated subdivision developments.

Strong regulatory pressure on environmental issues and the improved public awareness will continue to influence the market demand for sustainable housing in the coming years. Despite this potential, the voluntary up-take rate of sustainable practices is not as high as expected within the new built housing industry. This is in contrast to the influx of emerging building technologies, new materials and innovative designs as seen in office buildings and exemplar homes built worldwide. One possible reason for this is that key stakeholders such as developers, builders and consumers do not fully understand and appreciate the tangible and mutual benefits of sustainability in their professional and business activities. This situation warrants the study of a multifaceted strategy that integrates the needs of multiple stakeholders. This research investigates multiple factors that affect key stakeholder\u2019s benefits in sustainable housing implementation.

AbstractGreen building assessments are part of the globally accepted climate change mitigation method. The Green Building Index for Residential New Construction (GBI-RNC) from Malaysia belongs to a cohort of similar assessment schemes that evaluate various types of buildings throughout the world. There are similarities between GBI-RNC and other schemes such as LEED for Homes (US) or CASBEE for Detached Houses (Japan) in the use of indicators to measure the environment, social and economic aspects of houses. In order to continually improve the implementation of GBI-RNC, the indicators used to rate Malaysian houses need to be analysed and revised. Hence, this study evaluated the indicators in GBI-RNC against three existing Malaysian green homes. These three case studies are the CETDEM Demonstration, Cool and Energy Efficient House in Petaling Jaya, the Smart and Cool Home in Semenyih and the CoolTek House in Melaka. From this study, it was found that 13 out of 33 indicators with a combined score of 52 out of 100 points have to be revised due to various incompatibilities against the case studies. It was also found that the total GBI-RNC scores did not represent the inherent green home credentials of the assessed case studies due to various reasons.

This article presents a case study of the Waterbury (Connecticut) bus maintenance facility, exploring the issues involved in creating a modern, appropriate facility. The current Waterbury bus maintenance facility was built over 60 years ago as a metal casting foundry and it was last renovated in 1982. The current facility has inefficiencies within the building systems and bus circulation patterns including undersized workspaces. After the site was studied, it was determined that the location could not accommodate growth, and the renovation of the facility would require a complete demolition in order to minimally provide the proper clearances that are now standard for a modern maintenance facility. Given this, it was determined that a new site was necessary in order to build a facility that will meet current and future needs of the operator. The new maintenance facility site will be located in Watertown, Connecticut a few miles north of the current facility. Characteristics of the chosen site will help meet the needs of a bus maintenance facility: the site is mostly level in grade, zoning is appropriate, and the adjacent industrial businesses are compatible uses. However, the selected property had site constraints that the design team and owner resolved utilizing a collaborative brainstorming process. The outcome of the process was a dramatic design that will meet the requirements of Connecticut High Performance Building regulations. The regulations were adopted primarily to require state-funded buildings to be built utilizing a high performance building standard equivalent to that of the United States Green Buildings Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System\u2122-Silver.

From the result we can determine if prefabricated houses are the future of construction method. Houses in wood are by far the largest in the prefabricated construction and are now 90% of new building. As expansion develops technology and now we build eight-story multi-family homes in wood. The prefabricated building has moved most of the work to the factory where, in a controlled environment produce finished elements which are produced in optimum conditions. This means that construction moisture in the materials no longer exists and all operations can be performed covered. The development has also led to significantly shorter construction times and under right conditions up to 80% of the time can be saved.

In 2009 a team from Kingston University led by Sayce was commissioned by the Ethical Property Foundation (EPF) to scope the possibility for developing a emarki which would recognise that non-domestic properties, even though not necessarily of a specification which would allow them to gain a building certification such as BREEAM or LEED, could make a significant contribution to driving more sustainable behaviour in respect of how buildings are managed. The driver behind this was an increased realisation that building use is as important as building design and quality in achieving a range of environmental and social benefits. The results of that unpublished scoping study (Sayce et al.), combined with the views expressed in focused invited workshops, encouraged the EPF to further develop the notion. This paper will report on the initial, but more importantly, follow-up research work including interviews with a range of key industry stakeholders. The results have reinforced the need for a emarki or eawardi that emphasises the social aspects of sustainability equally to the environmental.

Moreover, the appearance of the external decoration represents itself a remarkable conservation issue, influencing the overall aspect of the Chapels of the Sacro Monte complex. Besides further characterization of existing plasters, this study also deals with plaster laboratory formulation, in order to plan a possible intervention of re-proposition. This last topic is strongly related to color feature analysis on original plaster and to the selection of current available pigments to obtain the most similar color to the in situ plaster ones. These aspects guarantee a chemical and technological compatibility which have an impact on the final appearance. However, characterization and reintegration are not sufficient to fully pursue a conservation plan. It is well known that reintegration intervention should be conducted only when lacunae are too extensive, but the goal of preserving the original finishes as much as possible, will be achieved through the use of consolidants and protectives.

Decisions made during the design and construction phases of a building affect its level of sustainability. The environmental impact of the built facility is a major element of sustainability that is often assessed in terms of the CO2 emissions or carbon footprint of various activities such as material extraction, fabrication, transportation, and installation. Several tools have been developed to provide an estimate of the carbon footprint based on building characteristics such as type, location, and site attributes. Different tools such as the Build Carbon Neutral, Faithful-Gould Construction, yield different values of CO2 for the same building project. Moreover, most calculators conceal information about interim calculation and methodology used, which hinders in-depth evaluation and validation of the estimates. This paper compares a set of carbon footprint calculators for construction buildings. The comparison relies on a set of criteria which includes input data requirements, level of detail, potential for customization, and comprehensiveness.

The practices used in rating green buildings are constantly evolving and differ from place to place; there are fundamental principles that persist from which the rating is derived e.g. siting and structure, design, energy, water and material efficiency, indoor environmental quality, enhancement, operations and maintenance optimization, and waste and toxic reduction. The essence of green building is an optimization of one or more of these principles. This paper presents a comparative analysis of seven well-known sustainable rating systems - BREEAM, CASBEE, GREEN GLOBES, GREEN STAR, HK-BEAM, IGBC Green Homes and LEED by the perceptions and opinions of stakeholders in Nigeria certified in green building rating systems in an attempt to select and adapt a green building rating system for Nigeria. Various aspects of these systems were scrutinized and analyzed in order to find out the best option for the Nigerian built environment. Based on the findings of this study the green building rating systems LEED which is the dominant system in the United States and Canada is appropriate for Nigeria because it helps costumers determine environmental performance, with strong base, large investments and proven advantages scored the highest with 80 points out of 100 points.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2184801747"}}

However, these tools have found little application in most of the small and medium sized refurbishment / maintenance construction projects. Based on literature and practitioners\u2019 opinions and experiences sought through semistructured interviews, the sustainability assessment tool BREEAM has been critically evaluated. This research found that the BREEAM is mainly designed for large new build projects encompassing whole buildings, and it is expensive and time consuming to undertake so it is not suitable for small / medium sized refurbishment / maintenance construction projects. To exacerbate the problem, practitioners for such projects have very limited knowledge and training into using the tool. An alternative sustainability assessment tool in a simpler format and more affordable for assessing such projects is urgently needed.

During a building project's inception phase and when striving for highly energy efficient building solutions developers, architects and engineers have to assess a wide scope of potential concept variations with regard to their impact on life cycle cost (LCC). The earlier in the concept phase the impact of basic design and concept structures on the project quality and its LCC can be evaluated and discussed, the more effectively the LCC performance of a building can be maximized. However, gathering hard data on investment and operation cost at a very early planning stage is generally difficult, time and resource consuming and hence expensive. On the basis of a LCC tool that has been specially developed for this purpose such optimization process can be produced more effectively. The case study of the new headquarters of an Austrian wind energy provider illustrates how a systematic and continuous LCC evaluation can lead -especially during the early planning stages- to very high performing results without leaving aside economic constraints and classic corporate return on investment objectives.

In this con- text, we are referring exclusively to construction using precast elements (panel construction) with the maximum degree of readiness, which at the same time enables quick and good quality construction. However, the high level of readiness of the panels is also linked to an increase in the risks of production (the occurrence of faults and their consequences) which necessarily requires detailed analysis of the organizational system of the company.

As Sven Bertelsen and Rafael Sacks (2006) propose on their paper presented at the IGLC 14 conference: \u201cThe construction industry must therefore be seen as an industry conducting an eternal chain of interwoven projects as any participant is involved in more than one project at the same time. The aspect distinguishing the construction industry from mass or customized production is thus not the individuality of the product per se but the fact that the huge variation in project outcomes makes it necessary for the industry to set up a new production process\u2014 and therefore a new production system for each project\u201d. The proposed change was to fabricate very small lots of oneor two units of each different piece, send it to the construction site to be installed, checked for changes and adjustments needed, communicate those to production and implement the changes on the molds and on the production processes. This change is of particular importance because it is difficult to make sound decisions on materials management and supply chain management in regards to how much and when to order the materials on a construction project, combined with the uncertainty of it delivery (Tommelein 2006) IGLC 14, Tommelein and Li 1999).", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2235900945"}}

In the past decade, building research in Asia has been found to have diverged into a relatively less treaded subject of embodied energy (EE) assessment of buildings across their size and construction types as has been reported by several studies. As buildings are complex entities and known to be highly energy intensive, EE contributes a major share in energy use and carbon emission over their life-cycle. While the focus of most policies remains on operational energy of buildings, the energy embodied in the building fabric has, so far, escaped critical scrutiny. However, demand of housing coupled with the pace and scale of urbanization in Asian countries have triggered an unprecedented real estate surge, which translates into accelerated energy consumption during the making of the buildings itself. Thus, the cumulative effect of the embodied energy no longer remains a benign issue in the broader context of energy sustainability and optimization in the building sector. With this in view, this paper presents a base-line study of embodied energy assessment of some real estate case-studies, comprising of multi-storied residential apartments of steel reinforced cement concrete frame structure in and around the city of Calcutta (now Kolkata) in India.

The threat of dangerous levels of global warming demand that we significantly reduce carbon emissions over the coming decades. Globally, carbon emissions from all energy end-uses in buildings in 2004 were estimated to be 8.6 Gt CO2 or almost one quarter of total CO2 emissions (IPCC 2007). In Australia, nearly ten per cent of greenhouse gases come from the residential sector (DCCEE 2012). However, it is not merely the operation of the buildings that contributes to their CO2 emissions, but the energy used over their entire life cycle. Research has demonstrated that the embodied energy of the construction materials used in a building can sometimes equal the operational energy over the building\u2019s entire lifetime (Crawford 2011). Therefore the materials used in construction need to be carefully considered. Conventional building materials not only represent high levels of embodied energy but also use resources that are finite and are being depleted. Renewable building materials are those materials that can be regenerated quickly enough to remove the threat of depletion and in theory their production could be carbon-neutral. To assess the potential for renewable building materials to reduce the embodied energy content of residential construction, the embodied energy of a small residential building has been determined. Wherever possible, the conventional construction materials were then replaced by commercially-available renewable building materials. The embodied energy of the building was then recalculated. The analysis showed that the embodied energy of the building could be reduced from 7.5 GJ per m2 to 5.4 GJ per m2 i.e. by 28%. The commercial availability of renewable materials, however, was a limiting factor and indicated that the industry is not yet well positioned to embrace this strategy to reduce embodied energy of construction. While some conventional building materials could readily be replaced, in many instances a renewable substitute could not be found.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2248702220"}}

Four environmental impacts are energy, water, waste and recycle and CO2 emissions. Four economic costs of design, construction, operation and green are the economic components. From analyzing the characteristics of buildings, three prominent indicators are determined: (1) construction cost/energy consumption, (2) operation cost/CO2 emissions, and (3) green cost/CO2 emissionsreduction.
