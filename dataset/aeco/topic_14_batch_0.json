Abstract Expansion joints are essential components for maintaining the stability of numerous bridge types by accommodating and absorbing the movements of a bridge. Various factors cause bridge movement, including thermal expansion, weather variation, vehicle movement, and strain from different loads. To minimize damage and maintenance costs, joint monitoring is utilized to detect any negative changes or deterioration to the joint. Current methods of joint monitoring are costly and time-consuming, creating a demand for new processes that can alert engineers before the damage becomes extensive. Recently, Europe and Asia have been at the forefront of joint monitoring efforts, such as the inspection of 150 expansion joints on the highways in Portugal. In addition, many studies of temperature and thermal effects on bridge joints have been done on several bridges in China, including the Ting Kau Bridge in Hong Kong, the Zhanjiang Bay Bridge in Zhanjiang City, a suspension bridge over the Yangtze River, and a cable-stayed bridge in Ningbo. However, there are not many applications in the United States. In this paper, the current joint monitoring practices for six Department of Transportations in New England are presented as a technical survey. This survey on bridge joint monitoring provides details about the impacts on the expansion joints caused by certain factors such as structural movement at the joint, traffic loading, joint design, and the materials used. By understanding the effects of the surrounding elements on the bridge joint, a better process for long-term monitoring of expansion joints can be developed, which is beneficial for the safety and stability of the bridge.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391656972"}}

Abstract Historically, expanding economies see a boom in the construction sector followed, some decades later, by issues associated with aging infrastructures. Sometimes, the bridges are performing as expected but a change in the codes or on the traffic loads trigger the need for wider or stronger structures. When this happens, the old paradigm of building bigger and more modern bridges is no longer valid, as we face one of the biggest challenges of our history: climate change. Sustainability is, or hopefully it will soon be, the main criteria when it comes to deciding how to intervene on an aging bridge. It is widely agreed that extending the life of an existing structure is more sustainable than building a new one. Amongst the many ways of retrofitting a bridge, external tendons made of prestressing steel are a versatile, well proven, and efficient way of strengthening existing structures, whether these were originally fitted with external tendons, or not. For bridges with damaged existing external tendons, specific replacement methods have been developed. In this paper, we will present a selected number of bridges where external tendons have been added or replaced, focusing on the lessons learnt whether for future strengthening projects or for the design of new structures.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4387020552"}}

The research is methodically based on a qualitative approach to identify the expert opinions of professionals and designers who are currently participating in urban infrastructure design. The data were gathered through interviews, and the findings show that the practice of sustainable urban bridge design is still in its infancy, and even the concept is unclear to many professionals in the field.

The future bridge is a 2-span, 68+144 meter-long box section structure, and its 65 meter-high inclined pylon will stand out from the city skyline. In addition to key design issues such as the global structural design and the details of the connections of the main load-bearing elements (cables), other structural problems requiring innovative solutions also arose during the design process. Several structural versions have been carefully analysed as early as in the initial phase of the design with the purpose of ensuring adequate torsional stiffness of the deck. Due to the sensitivity of the cable-stayed structure to the wind, cable vibration and the flow analysis of the beam and pylon also had to be carried out. The issue of construction technology had to be paid extra attention during the design procedure, since transportation by river and road were both limiting factors in the region. The paper covers the architectural and structural design of the future bridge in Gy\u0151r, offering a brief outline of the most important details and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4385631539"}}

Originally built in 1907, the Traffic Bridge was Saskatoon\u2019s first bridge to carry vehicular traffic. The Traffic Bridge was designed as a 5-span Parker through truss and came into being when residents of the Village of Nutana agreed to merge with the Town of Saskatoon and the Village of Riversdale to form the City of Saskatoon. The heritage value of the Traffic Bridge lies in its status as a landmark in the community, its form, massing, and location, the engineering technology used (steel truss architecture), and the original concrete piers and abutments. Throughout its 103-year history, the bridge has been used for horse and carriage, streetcar, and modern vehicle use. The bridge was closed in August 2010 due to public safety concerns due to advanced deterioration of critical structural members. In 2010, the City commissioned a needs assessment and planning study of the Traffic Bridge, which investigated multiple alternatives and potential replacement, included extensive public consultation, regulatory review and debate, as well as City Council presentations. Many elements of the existing bridge were to be incorporated into the new bridge. Engineering studies were completed on the existing elements to determine strengths and compatibility with the new structure. City Council and public participation in all aspects of the bridge replacement process were an integral part of this project. A P3 model was used for the design and construction of the replacement bridge. Many challenges presented themselves during the design and construction of the structure and these challenges provided unique resolutions. The construction of the replacement bridge was completed in 2018, and upon completion, the contractor became responsible for the maintenance of the bridge for the following 30 years.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4281623247"}}

Strong, versatile, durable, and vector of economic development, this exceptional material is also the principal cause of greenhouse-gas emissions, material depletion and waste generation by the construction industry. Hence, reusing concrete elements extracted from obsolete building structures has large potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact of construction. To demonstrate the potential of such an unusual strategy for bridge construction, this paper shows the construction of the Re:Crete arch prototype. It is made of 25 reclaimed concrete blocks connected through post-tensioning to create a 10-m span arch. The complete design-and-build workflow of the prototype is presented, including the structural design of the arch, the sourcing of the reusable concrete elements and the assembly. The Re:Crete arch prototype mechanical properties and environmental impact are assessed through non-destructive investigation, load testing and Life-Cycle Assessment. The results show that the reuse of concrete blocks leads to a comparable structural behaviour as a similar arch made of new or recycled concrete, with an environmental footprint reduced by more than 70%.&lt;/p&gt;", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4281770081"}}

Many cities have witnessed intellectual changes regarding the process of renovating urban spaces, advocating the promotion of urban quality and sustainability, focusing on pedestrian movement, and emphasizing social interaction. These intellectual changes affected the design process of urban pedestrian bridges, which led to the emergence of new meanings and uses for them. Urban spaces started to have values \u200b\u200band meanings linked to the identity of the city. This research aims to determine the impact of these intellectual trends according to the ideologies of contemporary urban design. The research defines pedestrian bridges and contemporary urban ideologies and their importance as a research topic. Several studies were reviewed, the research problem emerged (the lack of comprehensive knowledge and cognitive perception of the urban dimensions of pedestrian bridges in general, and in contemporary design ideologies in particular). The research adopted the descriptive-analytical method in building the theoretical framework, and then the practical study included evaluating the local experience (Al-Kuraiat pedestrian bridge) in Baghdad according to a quantitative scale (experts questionnaire). The results of the survey showed that the local project achieved good values. Can be justified by another local experience, as this bridge is considered the first pedestrian bridge over the Tigris River. \u0634\u0647\u062f\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0645\u0646

Introduction. Tourist attraction of Ukraine is one of aspects of economic development. Taking into account Ukraine\u2019s desire to become a world level country and to develop tourist potential, there is a necessity to update the quality of transport infrastructure as well as its aesthetic expressiveness. Problems. Almost all of Ukrainian bridges (especially small and mid-sized bridges) look monotonously because they were built in context of money saving. Due to this reason, Ukrainians associate them exclusively with transport structures that serve only for passage of traffic and pedestrian flows and do not need an art expressiveness. Purpose. To analyze an existing Ukrainian and world experience of bridges and overpasses designing and building to reveal the ways of achieving their aesthetic attractiveness in purpose of its implementation in Ukrainian bridge designing. To propose the methods of updating an existing transport structures in Ukraine. Materials and methods.

In the conditions of considerable limited financial possibilities of our country, it is necessary to concentrate on the most visited bridges and overpasses on the main roads. The designing of artistically expressive construction of bridges is the task of the medium and longer term. But now due to pretty limited financial possibilities of country, it is worth to start with updating the image of an existing bridges.

The main trends in bridge building are: the implementation of new materials, the assimilation of novel technologies, and the construction time reduction. The new technologies assimilation is often associated with the need to build bridge structures in cramped conditions. Considered by the author balanced lowering method technology corresponds to these trends. The technology was developed at the Vienna Technical University, the main idea is to assemble the supporting elements in a vertical position with subsequent deployment to the design horizontal position. To reduce the weight of the mounted elements, this technology uses thin-walled prestressed precast concrete units. After installing it in the design position, they perform the function of leave-in-place form and are cast in place directly on the construction site. This technology was invented for high pier bridges to eliminate the erection and dismantling of temporary support but has recently been shown to be cost-effective for low pier bridges. The advantage of this method is not only the construction time reduction and the free underbridge clearance presence but also the fact that the braces are not only a mechanism for turning the span into a horizontal position but also allow to reduce the estimated span length. The article discusses the bridge projects across the Lafnitz and Lahnbach rivers in Austria, as well as previous options for bridge projects.

Abstract The Elbe-Vltava Waterway (EVW) consists of continuously navigable sections of the Vltava and Elbe rivers in the Czech Republic comprising a total length of over 300 km. Most of the length of this waterway was obtained by building a system of interconnected weir basins using the canalization method. Detailed plans for making this waterway navigable started in the early 19th century, and the construction of the structures was enabled by the Austro-Hungarian Water Act of 1869. So, most locks along this waterway constitute a part of industrial heritage. Among its main structures are weirs, hydroelectric power stations and locks designed by pre-eminent Czech architects of the 19th and early-20th centuries. Many of them are excellent examples of modernist industrial architecture. Since the beginning of construction of the weir system along the EVW, bridge construction also came into focus in order to provide transportation access to both banks of the Elbe and Vltava rivers in this historically heavily urbanised area of Bohemia. This article deals with the historical development of bridge constructions over the EVW, systematically categorising them as road, railway and pedestrian bridges. Focus is on the basic technical aspects of the bridge design and technical solution, but also on their historical value and the need for a sensitive approach to their modernisation. The goal of the research is to complete the current web application www.lvvc.cz devoted to the EVW structures with the architectonically and technically most interesting bridges, including their histories. The system has been designed as an expert system, making the archived historical documents, maps, plans and photographs available for use by government institutions as well as by the general public for education and for the protection of this technical cultural heritage. The research was conducted as part of project no. DG18P02OVV004 entitled \u201cDocumentation and presentation of technical cultural heritage along the Elbe-Vltava Waterway\u201d within a support programme for applied research and experimental development of national and cultural identity, funded by the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4200274231"}}

Abstract Students of Structural Analysis and Design Engineering Technology are required to develop a capstone project covering the design theory and concepts developed in their courses. This paper presents the results of capstone projects that encompass the evaluation of existing structures, which were designed following building codes from more than 50 years ago. The infrastructure of the US is known to be aging and needs to be assessed and updated if necessary, so future engineers need be prepared for this task. These capstone projects expose students to the challenges of reading and interpreting drawings that reflect well-made designs, but following superseded codes whose current versions are more demanding. The projects studied and discussed in this paper are the bridge \u201cTravis St. over Buffalo Bayou\u201d, located in Houston, TX; and the coliseum \u201cRoberto Clemente\u201d, located in San Juan, PR. Students submitted a final report showing relevant details on CAD drawings, material takeoff, structural analysis, and retrofitting design and/or additional recommended studies. The superstructure of the bridge consists of three continuous spans, two of 67 feet at the ends, and a central span of 112 feet, for a total of 246 feet. The steel beams are vertically curved and receive a seven-inch concrete slab for two traffic lanes, a pedestrian sidewalk, and safety barriers, with an overall width of 37\u2019-6\u201d. A commercial finite elements software is used to model the beams and slab. The applied loads are from the latest AASHTO standard, which has significant differences from the code used in the original 1968 design. The coliseum structure consists of four reinforced concrete buttresses, a reinforced concrete perimeter beam that receives a roof system that includes four main trusses, prestressed concave and convex cables that support precast slabs grouted on site. The roof has a span of 314 ft that forms a rigid shell with a hyperbolic paraboloid surface. Students make the numerical model using a commercial finite elements software. Roof structural elements are verified to meet the latest ASCE 7 standard. These projects have multiple educational objectives in engineering, such as practicing technical communication through drawings, written reports, and oral presentations; practice with finite elements software; and use of building codes for structural design.

In bridge planning, the successful translation of the many conditioning factors into a solution that meets all safety requirements while also addressing considerations such as economy and elegance is essentially a matter of conceptual design. Despite the utmost importance of that stage, which in addition to an intuitive understanding of load-bearing mechanisms calls for imagination and a sense of form and beauty, creative conceptual thinking is systematically underestimated both in engineering training and everyday practice. The resulting impoverishment of the profession stems not only from growing, need-driven and hardly reversible specialisation, but also from inexorably extensive and opaque standardisation and control. The rules for ensuring robustness reflect the increasing complexity and opacity characterising structural design codes. While the practical importance of designing and building robust structures is universally acknowledged, the codes presently in place are often vague or confusing. Cross-referencing, in turn, may lead to loops around rules that, confounding engineers, are counterproductive. At the same time, however, that lack of clarity may afford opportunities for innovative solutions by building items that ensure robustness into the conceptual design of a structure. This paper proposes an operational design process that deals appropriately with all factors of structural performance, including robustness, without compromising bridge economy or elegance. That process, which combines a number of robustness strategies, including risk-based considerations, is illustrated with a case study of a proposal submitted to a design competition for a viaduct.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3185310259"}}

For most pedestrian bridges where the perception of the user is on a different level as for a highway bridge, functionality provides more than just cost driven or efficiency driven parameters. It is more related to the added value for the community. When design not solemnly derives from the sheer taste and predilection of the designer but is based on the user\u2019s experience, it generates a durable relation with a feeling of ownership of its users. The key is to create this experience in an elegant and natural way and not forced or dictated. It should be people's own unique discovery and should not be imposed.&lt;/p&gt;", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3169183428"}}

Good bridge designers strive to balance their desire to build structures that serve their community, blend with the surrounding environment and are attractive to users, with financial and other project constraints. For long span bridges, commonly adopted types achieve good aesthetics just through the expression of a suitable, effective structural form. More than a century of achievements and advancements in the design of suspension, cable-stayed bridges, tied arches, trusses and other types of long span bridges do offer an array of possible solutions that, if developed with the right sensitivity and good attention to details, can bring lasting aesthetic value to the built environment. Although a \u201cForm follows Function\u201d approach does not always translate into good bridge aesthetics, that approach can be more challenging for short and medium span bridges, for which utilitarian structural schemes are more commonly adopted. The development of conceptual studies, good structural design and attention to detailing can achieve aesthetic results for these bridge types while meeting project financial constraints through a strong partnership with owners and the right attention to the needs of the community and the surrounding environment.

The objective of a bridge design is to produce a safe bridge that satisfies all functional requirements with a cost that is acceptable by the owners. However, with accelerated development of people's aesthetic awareness, the design of urban bridges is gradually developing towards novelty, harmony, and customization. The most critical issue in constructing an aesthetically pleasing bridge is that there is no such rule to conceive of the most perfect or elegant design. In recent decades, a large number of bridges have been built on the Haihe River in Tianjin, China. This paper focuses on the introduction and implementation of innovative aesthetics design for urban bridges in this city. The design of new bridges on the Haihe River adheres to the people-oriented conception, and to the successful combination of aesthetics and functional design specifications. Complementary scientific strategies are implemented during the reconstruction of old bridges on the river to protect the cultural relics and preserve the history. The overall design conception in this paper is the harmony of mechanics and aesthetics as well as the harmony of bridges and its surrounding environment.

Starting with the 12th century until the 18th century, these bridges had an important role in the urban areas in which they were built, not only because they were strategic paths over a watercourse, but also for the development of economic activities and social cohesion. A bridge is primarily an infrastructure work, but with the increase in space requirements in cities limited by their fortifications, it has exceeded its purely transportation purposes, becoming an architectural object. We can talk of an interconnection between architecture and infrastructure at the most primary level. Today, bridges famous for their historical charm, such as Old London Bridge, Ponte Vecchio or the medieval bridges over the Seine were in their time multifunctional spaces in those cities. As housing often associated its production and commercial spaces, the bridge became true commercial promenades and places for social interaction for local communities. This multifunctionality has transformed the simple transportation structures into real architectural forms, highly adaptive and even resilient. This study aims to determine the versatility of the bridge as a complex space, having all the attributes we are discussing today regarding a future architectural work. These bridges are hybrid and adaptable structures that can combine multiple functions and can discuss the possibility of diversity. The research starts with identifying the basic factors which caused their emergence but also their downfall, ending with the utopian attempts of the architects of the last century to bring the inhabited bridges back to our modern society.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3213062046"}}

It is this \u2018construction and aesthetics\u2019 combination that makes them landmarks, which will be demonstrated in the paper by selected cases include both high structural and aesthetical qualities, transforms them to landmarks and icons of their city. On the other hand, by the development of new materials and construction styles, aesthetic consideration come forward by productions of sculptural steel construction bridges in cities. Basically paper consists of two parts, which first one is literature review that introduces aesthetic values in design, landmark features, classifications of iconic concept and 2nd part includes general mapping on bridges from past to present with different functional and constructional styles. In the article, aesthetics in design and landmark concept have been introduced strongly in order to understand the meaning of \u2018icon\u2019. Thus especially the design content of Enzio Manzini have been introduced in the article with his work \u201921.th Century Values of Design\u2019 which he explains the importance of aesthetics in design. In addition, at this part, design elements as an architectural language formed by \u2018point, line, plane\u2019 and visual elements such as; \u2018shape, form, color and texture\u2019 have been introduced. In order to continue, design principles such as rhythm, balance, emphasis, scale &amp; proportion, hierarchy have been introduced in the study to reach landmark concept. At second part approximately fifteen unique bridge design and construction have been investigated from all around world such as; Florence, Singapore, London, Sydney, San Francisco, France, Amsterdam, China, Australia and Turkey. All of these selected bridges accommodate iconic features uniquely and differently from each other which transform them to a landmark of their city or environment. The uniqueness of the bridges depends on superiority of some features such as; the length, the height, type, function, construction, material, form, referring the construction system design such as; helix, space frame, steel tensegrity, cable stayed steel swing bridge, single arch and hangers, pods steel high tech materials, steel, pylons and abutments, suspension bridge, steel through arch bridge, wave form made up of seven undulating curved steel, stone build, a three stage pointed arched stone bridge.

Thus, when a unique structure meets with technology and/or high aesthetic qualities such as design principles and color, the structure of a building becomes an icon for its city. Then, at 3rd part, four iconic bridge cases have been investigated through their aesthetic and landmark values. At the end, important keys will be collected for aesthetically designed future bridge constructions.

Abstract. In the 1950s and 1960s of the 20th century a lot of one- and two-span bridges with a span of 4-6 m were built on public roads on the territory of the former USSR. The paper describes the features of the design and construction of small four-hinged reinforced concrete bridges on lightweight supports of engineer Slovinsky system. The experience of surveying small bridges shows that in the context of a limited funding, compared to other types of bridges, maintenance and operation of these bridges does not get enough attention. There are relatively low material losses from their destruction and it is possible to restore them fairly easily. Therefore, many of them have a large number of defects and are in a poor physical condition. The purpose of the work is to draw attention of owners to the problems of small bridges using a specific example, as well as to present effective constructive solutions for the reconstruction of a small four-hinge bridge. These design solutions are developed on the basis of the research and development in Lviv National Polytechnic University and include the use of a reinforced concrete cover slab. The slab has been frequently used in other bridge reconstruction projects and proved its technical and economic efficiency in practice. The article gives characteristics of the bridge, the technical state of its structures, the main defects and damages, as well as the characteristics of the stream and its influence on the condition of the bridge. The design solutions for widening and strengthening the small bridge of the Slovinsky system can provide operational performance and consumer properties in accordance with the requirements of the current design standards for new bridges.

In the past few years there have been big discussions on the demolition of Nylandsveien bridge. Our project opposes the removal of the road bridge and wishes to demonstrate and exemplify the potential of the structure. The purpose of our project is to transform the bridge from a pure traffic machine to a real asset for the city.   By allowing the structure to be inhabited by a variety of programs, people and activities, it enables the city to reclaim the road bridge and strengthen its relationship with it. Our project explores the potential of combining the vehicle bridge with programs that focus on mobility, commerce and the community.   Gronland metro station is located underground close to our site. We have expanded and improved the existing metro station entrance underneath the bridge. The new metro entrance is a hybrid building that connects to the existing Riverside Youth Centre with an added cafe and community library.  Many of the programs we have incorporated into our proposal are programs that currently exist on the site. Our project focuses on enhancing and improving these activities such as Stargate Pub, Riverside Youth Center, Gronland Paddle Club, Gronland Metro Station and businesses in Smalgangen. We want to encourage and preserve many of the programs and facilitate in joining them more together to create a more unified whole. This transforms the bridge city highway to a new public interior.   Today the Nylandsveien bridge does not connect to the ground floor of Gronland in any way. We propose additional access points (ramps and staircases) up to the bridge level from several spots on the ground floor level so that pedestrians can have access to the road bridge. This increased access strengthens the potential of the bridge as a transportation vessel through the city while increasing mobility on many levels.   Glass bricks have been used all over the district of Gronland and close to our site (Oslo Spektrum and Gronland Police Station). Our project aims to revitalise the use of this ma- terial in a modern interpretation.

Many iterations of the design process are required at this stage to refine the concept for design and construction to adhere to functional, sustainability, financial and other constraints like right of way, etc. The tools used for analysis for investigations and iterations of the options may not necessarily be refined ones during conceptual design stage. The designer should have developed creative skills having a bent of mind for architecture and an architect having a broad insight in to structural engineering to render the best of the concept designs. While the structural designer must have a profound knowledge of engineering and available technologies, the architect can contribute in developing broad culture in many and important contextual aspects.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3092021594"}}

Abstract Public Works for Public Learning: A Case StudyLarge scale and small scale public works projects are important in the smooth operation of everycommunity, yet a majority of the population has little awareness of how these projects work andwhat their functions are. Few non-engineers understand the engineering challenges of deliveringclean water, disposing of our sewage, or changing a traditional intersection into a round-about, aproject that seems quite simple on the surface.A consortium of public works engineers, science museums, faculty, and exhibit evaluators wereawarded a grant by the National Science Foundation to build an outdoor museum next to a largesuspension bridge. The exhibits explain concepts such as forces in the main cables andsuspenders, the function of the towers and the anchorages, aerodynamics of the bridge deck,torsional resistance of the bridge deck, and bridge vibration, to name a few. A 1:75 scale replicaof the bridge provides an opportunity for people to see all of the elements of the bridge close up,and to see the structural elements inside the towers. Many of the exhibits are hands-on. Forexample, one exhibit that describes the trade-offs between tower height and main cabledimension, displays three suspension bridges side by side with towers of different heights(resulting in catenaries with different sags). By pulling on the cables of each model the visitorcan \u201cfeel\u201d that the shorter tower results in higher tension forces. The exhibits are complementedby web content (in multiple languages) so that visiting school groups and the general public canexplore the topics in more detail after their visit. Formative assessment was used throughout theexhibit development to incorporate public feedback into the exhibit design. Summativeassessment is ongoing.As part of the dissemination plan for this project, a conference on public works for publiclearning brought together representatives from both large scale and small scale public worksprojects from around the world to share their successes in using these projects for raising publicawareness.

Abstract Pedestrian Bridges - Structural Design by Masters of Architecture StudentsPedestrian Bridges all over the world offer an aesthetically creative and technicallyinnovative array of structures for student study.

Bridges reveal and exhibit theirstructural form much more clearly than most buildings do, and this makes them idealteaching tools. Furthermore, the AASHTO Guide Specifications for Design of PedestrianBridges represent a manageable introduction to formal engineering design for a semesterlong project. This paper describes a one credit hour semester long project undertaken byMArch students alongside a required course in Structural Engineering Design. Studentsundertook conceptual design of pedestrian bridges. After a class wide study of innovativeprecedents, they worked in small groups and were required to choose and analyze a site,and propose an initial structural scheme. A minimum clear span was required to pushmore ambitious spanning strategies. They then performed a Finite Element Analysis andsized all the primary structural members of the bridge. The results of the project wereexhibited to a jury of engineering and architecture professors, with students required todefend both their structural and aesthetic decisions in the design process. The results ofthe project were very successful. The jury found the design to be of a high standard bothtechnically and architecturally. Students reported that having autonomy over a wholedesign from start to finish both increases enthusiasm and helped students fully understandthe variables that influence the form and the scale of engineering solutions. 1", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2621926846"}}

Abstract NOTE: The first page of text has been automatically extracted and included below in lieu of an abstract Session 2525 Building Bridges: Computer-Aided Design as a Vehicle for Outreach to High School Students Stephen J. Ressler, Kip P. Nygren, Christopher H. Conley United States Military Academy This paper describes the use of a specially developed computer-aided design (CAD) software package as a vehicle for outreach to high school students. The CAD package was conceived and developed for future use in a nationwide engineering design contest, to be administered as part of the West Point bicentennial commemoration in the year 2002. In preparation for that event, the software has been used successfully in two different high school outreach activities. Student feedback from these activities has validated the concept of a CAD-based outreach project and provided useful suggestions for improvement as well. Called theWEST POINT BRIDGE DESIGNER, the software guides the user through the design of a truss-type highway bridge, based on a specified design scenario. The program was developed with three principal objectives in mind: \u2022 To stimulate interest in engineering and design. \u2022 To provide the user with an opportunity to perform a legitimate structural design, based on a realistic set of design specifications and constraints. \u2022 To focus attention on West Point\u2019s role as America\u2019s first engineering school and on the contributions made by West Point graduates\u2014past and present\u2014to the design and construction of the nation\u2019s infrastructure. The design scenario used by the WEST POINT BRIDGE DESIGNER is both realistic and open- ended. The user is asked to design a modern replacement for the Dunlap\u2019s Creek Bridge, the first iron bridge built in the United States1. The structure must be a simply supported truss. The only other constraints on the design are a specified span length, a maximum height restriction, and a minimum clearance over the high-water level of the creek. Within these bounds, the user has complete freedom to define the shape and configuration of the structure. Members of the truss may be individually defined, using any of three different materials (carbon steel, high-strength steel, and aluminum), two different cross-section types (solid bars and hollow tubes), and 40 different member sizes. The design must be capable of carrying its own weight and the weight of a standard AASHTO truck loading2. The design objective is to minimize cost. The software is written in the Microsoft Visual Basic programming language. It runs on IBM- compatible personal computers with 486 processor or better, running Windows 3.1 or better. The program features a simple graphical user interface, which students are able to learn easily, even if they have little previous experience with computers. The program\u2019s main window (called the Drawing Board) is shown in Figure 1. To design a bridge, the user simply draws it on the screen with the mouse. Editing of the structure is similarly accomplished by pointing, clicking, and dragging the mouse. Member properties-- material, cross-section geometry, and member sizes\u2014are selected from drop-down lists. 1", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2584889591"}}

Rivaling or exceeding those in the West in number, age, complexity, and architectural ambition, some of China\u2019s outstanding timber langqiao in the mountains of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces are on the cusp of being inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage cultural sites. Throughout south and central China today there is moreover a resurgence of new timber langqiao being erected using traditional carpentry alongside the unprecedented construction of modern marvels of steel and concrete. Archaeological evidence in 2001 uncovered China\u2019s earliest \u2018corridor bridge\u2019\u2014thus the oldest known covered bridge in the world\u2014with a length of 42 m dating to the Han dynasty 2000 years ago. The Rulong Bridge, which dates to 1625 and is documented as the oldest standing woven arch-beam langqiao , can be visited today in Qingyuan county, southern Zhejiang. Even older langqiao with parallel log beams as the substructure have come to light in neighboring Fujian province, most notably the Zhiqing Bridge in a rural area of Jian\u2019ou city that dates to 1490. China\u2019s bridges, whether with a corridor atop or without, have traditionally not been included under the umbrella of \u2018vernacular architecture\u2019 even as they usually were created by local craftspeople employing the same approaches and practices for dwellings and temples. Just as with these better researched structures, langqiao must be studied not only from the perspective of architecture, but also anthropology, geography, history, and sociology, among other disciplines. Rather than being abandoned as artifacts from the past, China\u2019s langqiao today represent a living tradition that continues serving rural communities as places of passage, spaces for leisure and marketing, sites for worship, and increasingly destinations for tourists in search of nostalgic connections with China\u2019s past.

Bridge erection is fully financed by state structures but it does not provide any direct economic return. Due to restricted public funds bridge building can last for years.

The use of wood in the construction of bridges has increased in recent decades thanks to the characteristics of this material, i.e., environmentally-friendly and suitability within natural landscapes. Nevertheless, timber constructions may be affected by degrading effects due to biological and/or abiotic agents, and may be exposed to impacts or vibrations due to external forces such as wind, earthquakes or walking pedestrians. Consequently, bridge performance with respect to these aspects should be assessed from the early design stage. Within this context, in this study, some shape, structural and durability strategies dealing with the design of timber bridges for pedestrians are investigated in order to extend the service life of these constructions. More precisely, a methodology consisting of three steps, to be applied at the early conceptual design stage, is proposed. The three fundamental steps to be considered in the preliminary design of timber bridges are: (i) main boundary constraints and load-bearing system; (ii) durability; (iii) vibration levels.

Billington. These aspects are (1) the relation between efficiency and economy, (2) the significance of originality, and (3) the challenge of shaping structural components. Efficiency and economy can only co-exist in a given structure when the ratio of the cost of materials is high relative to the cost of labour. Currently, this is not the case. The importance of originality relates to the visual expression of creative decisions made in design. For bridges, creative decisions made on the basis of purely practical considerations can be a valid source of aesthetic significance. The scope of creativity is not limited to the structural system itself, but rather encompasses the combined entity consisting of structure and site. It is possible to shape structural components on the basis of aesthetic considerations while maintaining a strict discipline of economy. The primary opportunities for using this source of aesthetic significance are created by structural dimensions for which a change produces only minimal effect on structural behaviour and cost.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3016358611"}}

(2) Methods: This paper presents a systematic method for the design of tower-like pylons (e.g., electric ones) able to improve the visual quality on the landscape areas in which they will be installed. The method identifies a design strategy that advantageously exploits the inevitable visual impact of pylons on the landscape by integrating the symbolic morphology and the topologically optimized pylon structure from the earliest design phases. (3) Results: The resulting structure is designed in three steps. First, a concept is morphologically developed by integrating symbolic references to the landscape, environment, or cultural society. Second, the concept is topologically optimized, by reducing the structural weight and its visual impact, and respecting regulatory requirements. Third, the resulting structure is engineered and embodied into an industrially feasible layout. (4) Conclusions: The method is able to develop an original, brand new tower-like pylon integrating all the types of requirements, such as regulatory, industrial feasibility, and social components\u2019 needs. The resulting electricity pylon presents an enhanced visual quality according to the citizens\u2019 feedback.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3004583483"}}

Most of the bridges and viaducts in the Netherlands were built in the sixties and seventies of the last century, and an increasing number of them will have to be replaced due to technical or functional reasons. The Netherlands is not an exception, many industrialized countries will face a similar replacement task in the near future. With the increased traffic intensities and the importance of mobility, the design and construction strategies for new bridges have to be different from that in the past. New methods need to ensure that traffic hindrance due to construction works and (future) maintenance activities are minimized. At the Delft University of Technology, a SMART bridge concept is being developed for fast and hindrance-free infrastructural replacement. The optimal advantage is achieved by utilizing innovative but proven technologies, and by bringing academic research into practice. A combination of recent innovations in construction technology, such as advanced cementitious materials (ACM), structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques, advanced design methods (ADM), and accelerated bridge construction (ABC) is being used. These innovations represent a step towards the next generation of infrastructure where fast construction, intelligent bridge design, sustainability, zero-energy, no/low maintenance, and aesthetics are key features.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3000244238"}}

Our current technological approach to design and construction is removing an important connection between humans and nature. Nature can teach us many things about design, as it represents a tried and tested response to the forces acting in our dynamic environment. Before modern technology we had to observe and design with nature and there were few cultures that did this as well as Aboriginal peoples of Australia. Modern society can learn (or re-learn) from nature and listen to our ancient cultures and produce design outcomes that are unique, context sensitive and durable. For example, road cuttings and embankments that match natural slopes \u2013 in gradient and vegetation cover \u2013 will be more stable, less maintenance and help the road fit in to the landscape. Bridges that include arched forms respond to nature\u2019s principles regarding gravity and compressive strength and can last thousands of years. A road alignment that skirts valleys, travels through saddles and works with contours rather than against, will follow the landscape, reflect its movement and form, minimise the impact on the natural and cultural heritage and need less effort to maintain. Using stone, understanding the rock, fitting it together in a skilled way will produce dry stone walls that will look beautiful and will last for centuries. In designing long lasting artefacts and projects with a timeless elegance and beauty, we should look around, understand and work with nature, learn from and value the practices of our ancient cultures and not just rely on technology.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2977918770"}}

Abstract Global warming is a result of greenhouse gas emission from various sources, such as industrial manufacturing, transportation, and construction activities. Among these, construction activities further involve the destruction of the natural environment, which should be protected for ecological balance. During construction, the natural environment should be protected by preserving the natural scenery while ensuring safe and rapid construction. To achieve this, the construction structure needs to be designed with the features of light weight, high efficiency, and safety using deployable structures. Deployable structures are superior over general structures because they can be extended in any area within a few hours and have less impact on the natural environment of the construction site, thus providing an alternative choice for environmental protection and conservation. In a deployable structure model, deployment and truss structures are combined using the scissor mechanism concept. However, the structure is required to remain in a stationary condition. Therefore, this study investigates the equilibrium theory of the scissor structure and presents the methodology of a new bridge construction method.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2981068433"}}

Arch bridges are part of the cultural heritage of all cultures of humanity. However, the tied-arch bridges are a relatively recent creation and their structural behaviour is not obvious for those who do not know the basic principles of structural engineering. However, despite this difficulty in interpreting the flow of forces, the tied-arches also have a strong symbolic significance for the Public. This visual or symbolic force, together with its inherent resistant advantages, such as the slenderness of the deck or their independence from the foundation conditions, make the tied-arches a very suitable solution when it comes to building a bridge in an urban context. In the present paper, several small-scale bow-string arches are presented, all of them built in urban or peri-urban areas. These bridges are characterized by the rational use of resources and by a formalization of the structural elements that make them modest examples of how structural engineering can serve, not only to fulfil a purely functional and resistant purpose, but also to contribute to ennobling the area in which a bridge is built.

The working season in such areas is less than six months in a year. The velocity of flow is also very large. Providing intermediate pier supports has created problems like tilting of piers, including foundations, due to erosion at many locations in such areas. Site specific structural design and aesthetic solutions using arch bridges have been worked out for following bridges: In all the above bridges, proportion, order and symmetry are well applied and the structures so produced have aesthetic value. A steel intensive scheme for the arch superstructure has been adopted for Wahrew, Tlawng and Sanjenthong Bridges to solve site constraints of less working season and very high velocity of flow, to improve the aesthetics and to take advantage of the lightness of the structure whilst erecting and improving seismic performance of the structure.

In most cases, bridges automatically serve as passages for animals, even if they have not been considered and designed for such a role. The following facts are importand: silence is positive for animals, natural guides are better then fences and walls, gentle lighting moderates car lights at night. Therefore, the semi-transparent canopy-type noise screens should be used, as well as olfactory tracks. The solution proposed here is beneficial for both the environment and road users. For the proper functioning of the bridge, it is crucial to take into consideration that animals are more efficiently guided by their smell than by channelling fences. However, the commonly used fences would also be provided. Olfactory traces can come in two kinds: animal faecal matter and mating scents.

With software now readily available to perform detailed structural analysis there is an opportunity to rebalance engineering courses towards much greater emphasis on understanding and design involving new approaches to analysis that can directly assist rational decision making. This paper demonstrates how simple, physically based, analyses can aid rational decision making in bridge design and suggests that such approaches could play a wider role in engineering courses. By way of illustration, these approaches are applied to the iconic, much copied, gravity balanced cable-stay Alamillo Bridge designed by Calatrava.

Today it is possible to produce from FRP not only separate bridge parts and single structural elements, but also entire span structures and one-piece composite bridges made as a monoblock element. The architecture of contemporary footbridges built with the use of fiber reinforced composite plastics in recent decades is being studied and analyzed in the article. The case-study examines the history of plastic composites as structural materials and the trends and evolution of the design of plastic products. The paper proposes a classification of modern pedestrian bridges made of fiber reinforced composites (based on a combination of innovation in the use of materials and in the design). The following three classes are distinguished: composite materials + traditional design; composite and traditional materials + hybrid design; composite materials + new design. The most recent examples of objects belonging to each of the three groups identified in the classification were reviewed and analyzed in course of the study (including contemporary Russian examples of composite pedestrian bridges). Particular attention is paid to the most advanced technologies, such as 3D-printing of composite bridges, as well as a number of other contemporary experimental production methods. The experience of scientists and manufacturers from Germany, Spain, Great Britain, China and other regions of the world has been studied. Further research and application of modern fiber-reinforced composites in combination with the latest production technologies of 3D-printing and computer parametric design can contribute to the development of modern bridge construction, which would be helpful for expanding the typology of structures and improving the design of new structures.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2966001902"}}

The influence of innovative solutions in bridge engineering on the aesthetic appearance of the created bridge structures is considered. It is noted that Robert Maillart paid great attention to the aesthetic possibilities of reinforced concrete when creating bridges. At the same time, he chose from all the options the most aesthetically appealing, but inexpensive design solutions for bridges. As an example, Salginatobel Bridge is considered in which rational power flows, low construction costs, and rich aesthetic value are embodied in a single structure. In the bridges of R. Maillart, innovation is the link that provides the link between an effective economic solution and an expressive aesthetic look. A group of engineers implementing an effective technology for the structural design of bridges and including Thomas Telford, Gustav Eiffel, Othmar H. Ammann is briefly discussed. It is noted that in recently built bridges, instead of an efficient economy, we find rather extravagance and inefficient use of resources. An example of a bridge structure with such weakness is the Esplanade Riel Pedestrian Bridge pedestrian bridge. Analyzed 5 factors necessary for the successful implementation of innovations that create aesthetic bridges: (1) the possibility of introducing innovations; (2) the presence of designers who are willing and able to introduce innovations; (3) the presence of designers who could create aesthetic bridges; (4) the presence of customers (owners) of bridges who would accept innovations; (5) the presence of customers who would not reject aesthetically expressive designs.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2966633980"}}

Focusing on rehabilitation of covered bridges, these Guidelines are organized by function of the structure. Following general principles, chapters examine superstructure, substructure, exterior envelope, site features, and safety/protection systems. The illustrated Guidelines are presented in a two-column format describing recommended and non-recommended treatments.  The book concludes with eleven covered bridge rehabilitation case studies (written by the engineers, bridgewrights, and public officials who worked on them), comprised of various truss types, locations, rehabilitation issues, and budgets.

It is evident that a rigorously conceptual design has to study the context in detail, including both social and environmental aspects.

The aim of this thesis is to present a design for a bicycle and pedestrian bridge which meets the requirements of Circular Economy; by incorporating strategies such as design for disassembly and modularity a structure is created which improves upon the long-term value of existing bridges. Circular Economy has in recent years begun to replace the sustainability paradigm as it provides more tangible strategies to achieve the same goals. Civil engineering is a large contributor to environmental impact and waste production therefore reducing this represented the main goal for this thesis; by designing a structure which uses alternative materials and connections to traditional methods the impact was reduced. The design of the structure consisted of the following main aspects; girders, connections, and detailing, these were verified using European norms to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design. Analyses were performed for the key structural aspects of strength, stability, and dynamic response; together with detailing of the components it was demonstrated that implementation of such a bridge is possible in practice. Once the final design was determined it was compared to a set of bridges designed with a traditional civil engineering approach to demonstrate the benefits of circular design in terms of environmental impact. It is concluded that a post-tensioned aluminium girder bridge represents a sufficiently strong and stiff solution for an 18m span and 3m width; the modular design allows for disassembly and modification on site meaning elements can be conveniently reused or replaced. In terms of environmental impact the result is dependent on the LCA method chosen; the Dutch method which allows bonus from reuse and recycling provides an even result while without this detraction the traditional structure is favoured significantly.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2939125562"}}

Bridges lie at the heart of our civilization bringing growth and prosperity to our society. It is by virtue of bridges that communities are able to physically connect to new people and to new places that were previously disconnected. However, bridges are more than mere functional assets. A well-designed bridge reflects mankind\u2019s creativity and ingenuity. The way that our bridges are commissioned, designed and procured is rapidly changing. Nowadays, a large number of experts from many different disciplines work on the design during different phases of the project. The segregation of knowledge into discipline-specific fields, and the fragmented approach to bridge procurement, have resulted in a general lack of cohesion in bridge design. The objective of this research is to identify a design approach, through all scales of the design, that leads to bridges that are well-integrated, that are integrally-designed and that are valued by society. The methodology of this research is the reviewing of numerous projects from my own bridge design practice. By identifying design considerations on four levels, namely the level of the landscape, on the level of the bridge, on the level of the detail and on the level of the material, this research demonstrates how an overall approach to well-integrated, integrally designed and valued bridges can be achieved by addressing each of these scales of the design. If the mutations in the field of bridge design that have occurred over the past 150 years have taught us one thing, it is that the field of bridge design has become far too complex to be embodied by one person, whether it be an engineer or an architect. The role that the master builder played up until the late renaissance, bringing together aesthetic design and building craft into one person, is nowadays fulfilled by a team of specialists. You could say that the integrated design team is the contemporary version of the renaissance master builder. The basis of the ideal team naturally consists of a lead architect and a chief engineer. Within this team, the architect should be the design integrator; he or she has the task of securing the equilibrium between Beauty, Utility and Solidity throughout every phase of the design process.

In most cases, bridges are an integral part of a grown, long-term development of infrastructure. While for the Renaissance architects and engineers bridges were part of the general infrastructure, urban bridges have become a natural continuation of the city with its various layers of meaning. Technological advancement and scientific thought during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries brought the concept of efficiency and the domination of fabrication processes into the design of structures; whereas in the past bridges were often considered as technical devices with a clearly expressed inner logic of form, today new forms of development for structures in footbridge design\u2014in combination with modern materials\u2014are resulting in greater effectivity and broader functionality. In order to shape the spaces on and around bridges, the load-bearing structures are often made visible above the deck, manipulating the spatial experience either directly or through a diagrammatic articulation of the structural behavior in the arrangement of the bridge\u2019s components. Recently there has been an intentional shift away from common perceptions of bridge design through the manipulation and dissection of structural typologies, leading to new interpretations and multilayered narratives. The aesthetic conception of the user\u2019s perception has been shifted away from the subtle reading of a familiar structural grammar toward a more direct influence on the user through the creation of clearly expressed structural figures. The structure itself is now not only more visible and actively involved in the spatial experience but it is also designed to suggest a greater form of immediacy through its increasingly performative character.

Abstract Bridges are of vital importance for the European infrastructure network. Due to their significance in the political economy, the requirement for sustainable, meaning highly advanced, cost\u2010effective, environmentally friendly and long\u2010lived structures is outstanding. Therefore steel composite road bridges were analysed in the Sustainable Steel\u2010Composite Bridges in Built Environment RFCS project (SBRI) by means of a holistic approach combining Lifecycle Assessment, Lifecycle Costs and Lifecycle Performance analyses to promote steel in the bridge construction. The partners of the project were the Institute of Structural Design Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Universidade Coimbra, Institut fran\u00e7ais des sciences et technologies des transports, de l'am\u00e9nagement et des r\u00e9seaux, BRISA Engenharia e Gest\u00e3o SA and ArcelorMittal.

The technology behind the construction of cable stayed bridges has advanced significantly in recent years. These enhancements have enabled engineers to construct longer and yet more slender cable stayed bridges. The technology has led to some truly stunning engineering landmarks which stand as testament to the skills and ingenuity of the engineers that have created them. This paper highlights some of the major advances in technology, drawing from personal experiences on Stonecutters Bridge, Hong Kong and the Rion \u2013 Antirion Bridge, Greece. There have been many significant improvements in the materials available to the engineer in designing a cable stayed bridge. The properties of concrete have been improved with a greater understanding of blended concrete mixes and the use of additives. Consequently short and long term concrete strengths have increased, while the heat of hydration has reduced. Similar improvements have been made to steel properties with higher grade thermo-mechanically controlled process (TMCP) steels, giving the designer greater flexibility to design slender and lighter thin plated decks. Significant work has been undertaken in reducing the drag of stay cables by reducing the diameter, while the life of the cables has been enhanced by improvements to protection systems. The effects of wind-rain vibration can be overcome by modifications to the sheathing and addition of cable dampers. The work of the designer has benefited from sophisticated software packages, enabling detailed 3D models to be developed of the global structure, detailed finite element modeling of components and analysis of complex dynamic effects such as wind buffeting.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2924633283"}}

Bridges are being constructed around the world and are increasing the number of assets to be maintained in the future. Since the Roman Empire to Victorian Era, the bridges are being constructed of timber, stone, masonry to the modern era of constructing the bridge with Glass-Fiber Reinforced Plastic materials. From stone masonry to concrete and steel, the bridge of each material type has different durability level, maintenance issues, repair and retrofitting requirements.  The modern bridges being constructed are more durable and lower life cycle cost. Now the focus is more on the environmental aggressivity in which the structure is being constructed and take adequate preventive measures at the design stage. The old structures before the 1980s have a lot of repair and retrofitting requirements. With the increasing load of traffic and the requirement to accommodate more number of lanes per bridge, it is a challenge for bridge engineers to check the structure to the lowest factor of safety, thus avoiding the widening of bridges in some cases and contributing to the long-term sustainability.  To overcome the challenges for the optimum use of bridges, the paper suggests the way forward for inspection, monitoring and asset management. With the BIM becoming more popular, it has also discussed about the requirement of single database of bridge assets where all the inspections, current and new assets information can be centrally located. The requirements for the assessment and repair of structures is discussed and the way forward for 3D printing for repair of concrete bridges.

The early industrialization process required a higher and higher developed infrastructure to transfer more and more people and goods. These requirements lead to the development of new materials that can resist the higher loading, to advances in mechanical engineering, more sophisticated calculation methods and transfer of all these advances to infrastructure to build longer spanning or higher rising structures. During the 18th and 19th century, the advances in industrialization resulted in new production processes, for iron, too. After using iron in mechanical engineering, it was applied to infrastructure as well [1]. Today, these first old iron and early mild steel structures belong to the cultural and technical heritage of the world. When looking at them as an assessing engineer, it is in favour understanding the production process, the resulting microstructure and the mechanical properties of the specific material. Any historic iron structure requires special knowledge about connections, structural design and of course, the material behaviour [2].

Initially, a description of the characteristics and performance of traditional rehabilitation techniques is outlined. Later, the superstructure rehabilitation techniques based on the use of composite materials as carbon, aramid or glass fibre plates, as bonded external reinforcement, and aramid or glass fibre rods for prestressing are considered. The experience about the behaviour of strengthened beams under overloading and fatigue conditions are also outlined and the heat strengthening of steel girders after a collision is commented as well. The use of steel jacketing of columns is also described and the benefit of using link beams to improve the transverse seismic response of multicolumn bents. Base isolation as an appealing strategy for reducing the seismic demand in piers and foundations and the advantages of its application is discussed and the use of cable restrainers added for limiting the longitudinal displacement is also analysed.

Although all three projects concern small footbridges of free spans between 5 and 20 m, the instructional approach was different and ranged from autonomous student exploration to sustained guidance by practicing designers and builders. The corresponding completed prototypes range from ephemeral bridges unsuitable for public access to a fully functional bridge intended for long term public use. When aiming for safe and serviceable student-authored designs, a balance must be found between expert guidance and student autonomy. Both ingredients seem needed to maximize student learning outcomes and the sense of achievement gained from such projects.&lt;/p&gt;", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2751085000"}}

The new Dejima Footbridge is a 38.5 meter long steel plate girder bridge with a timber deck.

Public works tend to receive minor attention and sometimes even negative responses from the public. We designed this bridge with respect for its context and carefully planned the process of design and construction to take into account the history of Dejima and involve the local community.

Construction started in August 2016 and completion is expected by the end of 2017.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The connection includes two pedestrian bridges. The awarded design proposal includes an unprecedented technical innovation in North America: the use of Duplex Stainless Steel on the entire structure. This pioneering use of a forefront technology provides premium aesthetics within a unique setting in addition to a safe and durable asset for the community. The structure has an extended life cycle, is more corrosionresistant and requires less maintenance, reducing its overall cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each bridge is supported by a single arch rib inclining at 18\u00b0 to provide a slender, transparent and elegant impression. The two arches tilt in opposite direction, and the overall layout resembles a Yin &amp; Yang shape to emphasize both contrast and continuity, expressing a modern, understated and elegant aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2752977365"}}

Bridges that are designated historic present a special challenge to bridge engineers whenever rehabilitation work or improvements are made to the bridges. Federal and state laws protect historically significant bridges, and railings on these bridges can be subject to protection because of the role they play in aesthetics. Unfortunately, original railings on historic bridges do not typically meet current crash-test requirements and typically do not meet current standards for railing height and size of permitted openings. The primary objective of this study is to develop strategies that can be used to address existing railings on historic bridges and to develop solutions that meet current design requirements. In addition to the modification, selection, and design of the bridge railing, the bridge deck is also impacted by changes made to the railing. Due to increased force levels recently required by AASHTO, deck overhangs require significantly more reinforcement than for past practice. These increases are being realized on all bridge decks and may pose particular challenges for the attachment of railing to historic bridges. Therefore, a secondary objective of this project is to investigate the design of the deck overhang and determine whether reduced amounts of reinforcement are possible. For Volume 1 (Replacement Strategies), three phases of research were conducted. First, an overview of current practice for addressing historic bridge railings was performed. Second, an investigation was conducted to document historic bridge railings in Indiana. Finally, rehabilitation solutions were developed to address the specific bridge railings found in Indiana. Based on this research, three retrofit strategies were developed which include an inboard railing, curb railing, and a simulated historic railing. These rehabilitation solutions can be used to address historic bridge railings not only in Indiana, but across the country. For Volume 2 (Bridge Deck Overhang Design), experimental testing of half-scale and full-scale overhang specimens was conducted, and the results were analyzed. Failures of in-service bridge railings were also evaluated. Based on this research, recommendations are provided for the more efficient and economic design of bridge deck overhangs.

The objectives of the outreach activity are to spark interest in engineering among participants and to increase their awareness of engineers\u2019 contributions to society. Bridge model kits, consisting of paint-mixing sticks, binder clips, chains, S-hooks, and large bottles of water for load testing, are used by participants to assemble simple structural models of tied arch, cable-stayed, and suspension bridges. Participants are guided by engineers and are challenged to think critically about how the structure works. All items in the kit are easily procured, inexpensive, and compact. The novelty and utility of this engineering outreach activity lies in its expeditiousness, minimal use of space and resources, simplicity of concepts, and connection with real engineering design.

While the transportation system of the United States rapidly ages and expands, there is increasing demand for the demolition, replacement, modification, or rehabilitation of existing bridges; all of these actions require some degree of engineered deconstruction. In a 2013 report on American infrastructure a large number of bridges surveyed were reported to be structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, and many of the existing bridges have exceeded their 50-year design life. Although highway bridges have been deconstructed around the world for generations, there are few publications on the structural engineering aspects of the deconstruction process. This paper aims to shed light on the general nonexplosive deconstruction process by presenting aspects of a three-span continuous steel girder highway bridge example. General sequence, equipment, methods, economy, and engineering are discussed.

The concept of precast segmental bridges is not new: the first application documented was from the mid-1940s, designed by Eugene Freyssinet and built over the river Marne near Luzancy in France, between 1944 and 1946. Although innovative, it also contained traditional wet concrete joints between the members. The impressive breakthrough came slightly later with the introduction of match-cast joints by Jean Muller, first for a bridge near Buffalo (USA) in 1952, and later for a bridge across the River Seine at Choisy le Roi near Paris in 1962. This opened the way for a large number of new developments in terms of design, production approaches and construction techniques, and precast prestressed concrete segmental construction became rapidly one of the most efficient and successful bridge construction methods all over the world. These developments are still evolving, but the interaction between design, production and construction is a critical factor for success: the interaction creates opportunities to optimise the scheme, but at the same time is crucial to ensure safety, especially during construction, when large weights are moved, placed and secured, frequently at substantial heights. Engineers of all disciplines involved should interact during the development and realisation of precast segmental bridge (PSB) schemes, to conclude the optimum method statement and consequently check all the intermediate steps of the method statement in terms of stress, stiffness, stability, production and constructability. With the ongoing development of the PSB concept, and consequently moving limits in terms of dimensions, it was concluded to be appropriate to develop a Guide to good practice for the PSB construction method.  The present report was developed by an integrated team of engineers with roots in design, structural engineering, production and construction, and provides a valuable source of knowledge, experience, recommendations and examples, with particular emphasis on the fib Model Code for Concrete Structures 2010 and fib Bulletins 20, 33, 48 and 75.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2787603058"}}

About 50% of the world's population lives in deprived areas and most of the time they deals with transportation activities to meet their basic needs. Lack of access is the thing that strengthening the cycle of poverty in these deprived communities. The poorest people in the world faced with the disadvantages of lack of direct access to basic facilities and transport infrastructure which are among the basic needs. These accesses are provided in a variety of ways, including the intersections of pedestrian bridges. Pedestrian bridge technologies have a lot of differences in performance and cost and design.

The main objective of the present dissertation is to promote the construction of bridges and footbridges in wood. To that end, in this work are indicated the most important issues to be taken into account before deciding to build these structures. Initially, and chronologically, a study about the historical evolution of footbridges made out of wood is presented. This study concerns itself with the types of structures, the materials used and the technologic evolution. In this review, whenever possible, reference is made to the existing examples in Portugal. Then continue by presenting a research carried out about the structural solutions and materials used in the more recent wooden bridges and footbridges. In addition, the regulations and recommendations of the project available are analysed and discussed. After the research of the state of the art, the Haninge\u2019s footbridge, recently built in Sweden, is presented, described and adopted as the case study for this dissertation. Its structural typology and building process are analysed as well as its dynamic response. In this dissertation it is studied the application of V shaped fastenings in the connection of the arch to the deck of Haninge\u2019s footbridge. For this analysis, several parameters that must be taken into account in a structure of this type were evaluated, such as the strains present in the arch, the vibration modes and the buckling. For the parametric study to be conducted, the strains present in the arch of the studied structure were compared to those of a reference structure, so as to understand the advantages of changing the geometry of the fasteners. In this study it is also included the analysis of the dynamic behaviour of the structure and the length of the buckling stemming from both studied structural solutions. As a conclusion of the conducted parametric study, it should be mentioned that the application of V shaped fastenings in the Haninge\u2019s footbridge brings considerable advantages to its structural behaviour.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3149568591"}}

The construction of bridges has been necessary for societies since ancient times, when the communication between and within towns, cities or communities was established. Until recently, the economic factor has been the only one considered in the decision-making of any type of construction process for bridges. However, nowadays, the objective should not be just the construction of bridges, but of sustainable bridges. Economic, social and environmental factors, which form the three pillars of sustainability, have been recently added. These three factors usually have conflicting perspectives. The decision-making process allows the conversion of a judgment into a rational procedure to reach a compromise solution. The aim of this paper is to review different methods and sustainable criteria used for decision-making at each life-cycle phase of a bridge, from design to recycling or demolition. This paper examines 77 journal articles for which different methods have been used. The most used methods are briefly described.

The proposed changes to the curriculum focus exclusively on developing ways to improve the visual characteristics of practical bridges, since this will maximize the effectiveness of the proposed changes. New ideas that create additional economic value relative to the status quo are shown to be the primary raw material that can be used by designers to create good looking practical bridges.

The aim of this thesis is to respond to a need every day more emerging which is to create links connecting to open trade and social routes. The challenge is to avoid a distance of about 2.000 meters by constructing a hybrid bridge, a fact that has not happened so far because of the limitations that the different types of bridges present. Nowadays it is being built the 3rd Bosphorus Bridge and it is the most significant example of a hybrid bridge. The difficulty resides in becoming a motorway/railway bridge rising a total length of 2.164 m and being then the longest one in this category. The objective here will be to reproduce similar conditions of this superstructure but for this we will have to take into account some considerations. Broadly speaking, this study will be divided into different parts: a first part that will present the different characteristics of both a suspension bridge and a cable-stayed bridge, a second part where we will present the two models that we will study (2D and 3D), a third part with the construction phases of the bridge and a final part where both static and dynamic equilibrium will be verified. Most of the parts will be interrelated between them so we will see that there is not a strict order in this thesis. Anyway, for the first part we will be able to use all the existing information and we will just expose all the different variables in order to choose between them in the second part. In this second part we will use the Finite Element Method for the 3D Model and we will adapt this to a 2D Model choosing the final different cross \u2013 sections we will adopt, the required geometry for the different parts and the existing elements in SAP2000 to model the whole structure. The third part will be divided in two parts: one focused on the theoretical explanation about how to carry out the construction process and another one focused on the necessary calculations to reach consistent results. Finally it will be verified firstly the static equilibrium of the main parts of the structure accomplishing the Service Limit State (S.L.S) and the Ultimate Limit State (U.L.S), and secondly it will be carried out the dynamic analysis introducing the concept of aero - elasticity and studying this phenomena for three different models (2D Model, Fish-Bone Beam Model and 3D Model). However, we will be more focused on guarantee the static equilibrium designing and studying the different possibilities we can have in the different components of the bridge.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2613893233"}}

Due to the rapid economic development of Korea, the bridge have been built by government over the several years. Additionally, there are too many mountain and river and the bridge have been built in rural area. But bridge designers weren't considering the bridge landscape. And bridge was a negative factor in regional landscape. Because of this, this study surveyed the landscape preferences of rural bridge landscapes according to different bridge types. The results were summarized as follows: And this research include conducting a study on visual preference according to the bridge's type and background. And, the landscape of arch bridge in the river 1 is landscape of the highest preference. The the landscape of girder bridge in the river 2 is landscape of the lowest preference. In the river 1 and 2 landscape, high preference is observed in the arch bridge and low preference is noted in the girder bridge. In the mountain 1 and 2 landscape, high preference is observed in the cable-stayed bridge and low preference is noted in the girder bridge. In conclusion, the visual preference of bridge landscape depend on the background and bridge shape, the study said. Therefore, when bridge designer design the bridge, designer have to choose proper bridge shape according to the background. This research was conducted only in bridge landscape of rural area but the visual preference of bridge landscape can be changed according to the various background.

Over the years, the flexible culverts have grown bigger and today they are what one could call bridges; they are not just culverts anymore.

The research work has been ongoing for more than 30 years at the Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering, Division of Structural Engineering and Bridges, at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. Realizing that spans have grown larger and heights of cover smaller, the aim was to develop a design method that could be used in everyday design work.

The societal issue that this project tries to address is the increasing anonymity in residential urban neighborhoods. The increasing anonymity is caused by a decrease of social interaction between citizens that share the same living environment. The government used to subsidize community facilities like sports clubs and cultural institutions to maintain the social coherence. However, due to cutbacks and a belief in the participation society, the government will gradually pull back and take a less active role in supporting local community development. In order to create and maintain healthy, safe and attractive urban neighborhoods, residents should become aware of a social environment that is linked to the place. Therefor, social interaction among locals must be stimulated so that local communities are able to develop. Architecture is not able to create communities. However, architecture can facilitate community development by creating the right conditions. Not the architecture itself, but the social process of community building, has been put upfront in this project. The project includes a research and a design proposal. In the research has been searched for (spatial) conditions in which people are invited to interact with each other. The design is a community place for the Buiksloterham in Amsterdam. It is a pedestrian/bicycle bridge over the Johan van Hasseltkanaal, the widest canal in the neighborhood, that facilitates community development by providing space for self-organized community activities. The design of a bridge metaphorically suits the goal of willing to connect people. Furthermore it contributes to the improvement of the neighborhood on an urban scale. Because in the Buiksloterham people are invited to design and built their own house, the construction and making of the community place played a significant role in the design. The making of the bridge was not merely a technical problem to be solved, but became a major source of inspiration for the design. This is visible in both the building process (residents of the neighborhood are invited to come and see the making of) and the materialization. By making models of how the building process would work and working with the actual materials, concrete and wood, the constraints have been researched and turned into positive consequences for the design. The design of the bridge, a community place for the Buiksloterham, aims to catalyze the social process of community development.

One of the solutions to this problem is to build bridges and roadway overpasses so that their applying in addition to flowing traffic, landscaping and creating green spaces has least effects on the architecture structure of the place. Application of reinforced soil is one of the appropriate and modern methods in this field. In this method a combination of elastic elements such as soil and geosynthetic (e.g., network fibers and polymer tissues) is used and huge soil bodies are created for path in an optimal desired shape. One of the precious advantages of this method is use of soil which is a natural and inexpensive element with the capability of growing plants.

These excessive vibrations were seen as relatively dense and continuous flow of people was crossing the bridge. This type of observation has later been made for several other bridges, old as well as new. These observations have initiated an extensive investigation program quantifying structural properties such as natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping and their influence on the pedestrian induced vibration. Thus, the pedestrian lateral load phenomenon has equally been thoroughly investigated. As part of the pedestrian load investigation at the Lardal Bridge were a large number of time series with different sized groups of people recoded. This paper aims to re-analyze these data with the emphasis on the energy transfer between modes. It is clear from these response recordings that the lateral displacement is often not initially initiated, rather vertical or torsion motions. This is also true for several crossings of larger groups of pedestrians. This raises some interesting questions of how and when the pedestrian induced energy transfers between modes. From short time Fourier transforms (STFT) it can be seen that energy transfers after certain levels of response are reached. Interestingly, the horizontal mode, a reversed pendulum motion, includes a small vertical component with twice the frequency of the horizontal mode. The investigation explores the system sensitivities to group size, initially triggered response modes and the pacing frequencies of the pedestrian motion.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1156115770"}}

Different international non-profit  organizations in collaboration with local promoters are building these bridges with the purpose  of connecting isolated communities with health care and education.  The design and construction of these bridges has by and large relied on engineering judgment  and design conservatism coupled with past experiences of similar construction projects. An  interest to engage in the designing of similar bridges has been shown from staff at the Division  of Structural Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering of Lund University. This master thesis  aims therefore to provide more sophisticated models of suspended bridges as material for future  work.  Suspended bridges are suitable to use for long spans, both due to low construction cost and to  efficient material usage. They can also most often be built without advanced tools or machinery.  The bridges studied in this thesis are intended for pedestrians and animals which result in a very  slim design.  Recommendations mainly from the development organization Helvetas will be compared to the  Eurocode to investigate if these creates overly conservative designs. These comparisons will be  made with both hand calculations, the finite element software Brigade/Plus and data from  existing bridges.  Vibrations and sways due to wind can be a major problem for light suspended bridges. Due to  their small dead load in combination with a low lateral stiffness, the sways and vibrations can  be very large in comparison with more common pedestrian bridges.

In order to analyze the stress and partial displacement distribution of the station facade under natural gravity,we construct 3D structural and geometric models of the steel arch by the finite element method in ANSYS.

We also put forward a bridge space optimizing plan for Suzhou River from four angles: building harmony between motor vehicles and people, combining multiple lingering functions, creating abundant crossriver routes, keeping balance between historical conservation and modern use of historical bridges.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2394475790"}}

Engineering uses natural resources to fulfill the fundamental needs of society. For the building of a bridge, steel, stone, and other raw construction materials are used. The results are bridges that cross rivers, valleys, and the like. Besides bridges, our built world consists of buildings, highways, and all manufactured goods needed in daily life. Ideally, improvements in engineering should improve our economy; a better economy improves our living standards, which, in turn, should provide the capability to improve the environment we live in, thus making it possible to achieve sustainability. But a better economy can also spur consumption and deplete the world\u2019s resources even faster. Currently, it appears that the latter is more likely to happen. The Brundtland Commission defined \u201csustainable development\u201d as such: \u201cSustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\u201d (United Nations General Assembly 1987) But how do we know what and how much future generations need to live?

British and Irish railways once featured several thousand timber bridges and viaducts. Modern and contemporary sources suggest that these structures were replaced due to problems with decay. Consequently, this decay presents a significant challenge to proponents of modern timber bridges, with their critics arguing that timber structures would fail to satisfy the service life requirements. In reality, what actually had a greater influence on their performance and longevity; timber's inherent liability to decay, or deficiencies in their design and construction? This paper presents the findings of the first major study on nineteenth-century timber bridges in the UK, aimed at documenting the design and construction methods used, and their subsequent performance. Despite problems with decay, many nineteenth-century railway bridges lasted beyond their expected design life. Moreover, most problems affecting their life span were the result of erroneous design practices coupled with poor construction and maintenance, rather than inherent material deficiency. Crucially, they could be either obviated or limited through better detailing, modern preservatives and a more judicious consideration of structural forces. These nineteenth-century structures provide crucial lessons in timber bridge design for modern engineers as the profession looks to provide more sustainable infrastructure both now and in the future.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2041327195"}}

Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) has implemented the new AASHTO-LRFD provisions in the state specific Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) design procedure (KDOT LRFD). Most of the existing bridges constructed before the new provisions, have been designed based on the old provisions. In this study, these changes have been assessed based on the latest pertinent research, and two representative bridges, representing state bridges designed and constructed based on the new and old code versions, have been studied and their performance analyzed considering their real performance and new code revisions. In general, the two representative bridges provided by KDOT for this study, can safely address the demanded loads considering their actual strength and bridge structural-redundancy and load redistribution process. So, there is no immediate concern in terms of serviceability or collapse of these bridges under demanded loads, including the extreme vehicular impact load. However, the calculated shear strength of most of the columns designed and constructed based on the old codes may not be enough considering the new vehicular impact load required by the new code revisions. While no immediate action seems to be necessary in terms of serviceability and safety of these bridges, engineering judgment and a realistic case-based performance assessment are needed to decide if enhancement of the shear strength and the amount of lateral reinforcement within the plastic hinge length are necessary. Proper methods to retrofit these types of columns as detailed in Chapter 4 can be used, once a decision is made for a case to implement the aforesaid enhancement.

Designers working on historic bridge rehabilitation projects deal with conflicting objectives: rehabilitate and update the structure to meet current design codes and functional requirements or uphold the historic form, nature, and function of the structure. However, the requirements to satisfy each objective may be mutually exclusive. One obstacle commonly encountered is that current seismic code provisions were not required or even understood for 19th century bridges. In rehabilitating the bridge to meet current seismic requirements, it may not be possible to maintain the historic form of the structure. At a certain point, the question arises as to how much can be changed before the structure loses its overall historic nature. If a bridge is no longer truly \"historic\", is the added expense justified in comparison to replacement? In other words, does a shell of an historic bridge satisfy the requirements for maintaining an historic bridge with just its original form but not true function? Is that bridge still considered \"historic\"? When is an historic bridge no longer an historic bridge?

Dominating in space and serving to community, large infrastructures are often exposed to public judgment, especially those in urban areas, which are continuously seen by many viewers. Therefore, it is necessary to design not only reliable, durable and economical buildings and bridges, but also visually pleasant structures. Through several projects at the planning or design level as well as completed in last decade in Croatia it will be shown how the objectives of sustainable development could be achieved in urban areas. The described structural engineering projects in the capital city Zagreb, on Adriatic coast and in other regions are closely connected with the global strategy of country\u2019s development. The conservation of natural and cultural environment as one of the major issues confronting Croatia in the years ahead is also included in those projects. Fast growing city and economic development of Zagreb brought about needs for new bridges and buildings. However, those projects are planned though holistic approach and integrated in large-scale projects, including also urban planning of new green areas \u2013 recreational zones in order to provide important social and psychological benefits to human societies. Respecting the known aesthetics lows, for Bundek Bridge a unique structure is formed, which is already applied in the new airport terminal design, but it can be also transformed for other future landmark buildings, e.g. central metro station, as a modern style of the 21st century Croatian capital.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2785619648"}}

Codes and standards used for guiding structural design of buildings and bridges traditionally have been prescriptive and quantitative. In an era of gradual change in design and construction technologies, this traditional approach to structural design generally served the public and the profession well. However, prescriptive standards do not accommodate technological advances and innovations easily, and in the last three decades, such occurrences have changed the nature of building design and construction rapidly. At the same time, the performance of buildings and other structures during extreme manufactured events and natural phenomena hazards, such as hurricanes and earthquakes and flooding, has led to intense public and professional scrutiny and criticism of current engineering and construction practices. Finally, uncertainties are invariably present in structural engineering, and standards that do not take these uncertainties into account consistently (or, worse, do not account for them at all) are an obstacle to advancing structural engineering practice. With the advent of structural reliability as a tool for the treatment and analysis of uncertainty, the decades of the 1970s and 1980s brought the realization that although absolute safety is an unattainable goal, uncertainties in structural performance could be quantified (in terms of uncertainties in structural actions and response and in material strength and stiffness characteristics) and risk-informed structural design criteria could be developed that were consistent with a desired level of performance. With this realization, practical structural design standards that reflected these reliability principles evolved quite rapidly. Not only did this transition in thinking regarding structural safety and serviceability evolve rapidly, it evolved in most modern, postindustrial societies at about the same time. Modern building and bridge codes used in structural engineering practice are based on the notions of probability-based limit states design (PBLSD). In the bridge arena, these include the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications (AASHTO 2012), the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (Canadian Standards Association 2006), EN 1990 [European Commission for Standardization (CEN) 1990] and EN 1991-2 (CEN 1991), and EN 1992-2 (Eurocode 2) (CEN 1992a). There are some differences in the way that PBLSD has been implemented in the countries that have adopted it, but its fundamentals are similar in all countries. In addition to the quantitative modeling of uncertainties using probabilistic models and statistical data, the developers of PBLSD bridge standards have strived to base such standards on present day principles of structural load modeling and to use models of structural behavior that are founded on sound principles of structural mechanics in order for the structural response to be modeled as accurately as possible (within the constraints of practical design). Not surprisingly, PBLSD has opened the door to new research opportunities and challenges. For one, there are differences in code format; in theUnited States, the LRFD format is practically universal, whereas in Europe, a format that involves partial material factors and companion action factors has been adopted. From the viewpoint of the practicing structural engineer, these differences are superficial rather than substantive and stem from country-dependent traditional design practices that predate the introduction of PBLSD. The collection of papers presented in the December 2013 special section on \u201cEurocodes and Their Implications for Bridge Design: Background, Implementation, and Comparison to North American Practice\u201d reflects a broad spectrum of the commonalities and differences that have arisen in Europe, North America, and elsewhere as part of the move toward implementing PBLSD in practical bridge engineering. Marti-Vargas and Hale (2013) compare the treatment inNorthAmerican andEurocode standards of strand transfer length in prestressed concrete construction. The American Concrete Institute model is based only on the strand parameters, whereas the Eurocode 2 approach considers concrete properties as well, leading to a model that is more conservative in its predictions of required transfer lengths. Walbridge et al. (2013) focus their attention on United States, Canadian, Eurocode, and Swiss approaches to assess fatigue in metallic bridge structures using a simulation approach to show that simultaneous vehicle crossings, which currently are not considered in fatigue assessment, might increase fatigue damage substantially. Granata et al. (2013) consider the effects of creep and shrinkage on prestressed concrete girders usingNorth American and European approaches, concluding that the Eurocode predictions underestimate final deflections and the extent of stress redistribution among girders. Kappos et al. (2013) present a methodology for evaluating response modifications factors for earthquake-resistant design of concrete bridges in Europe and find that the available force-reduction factors for seven typical bridges are higher than those used for design, indicating that the strength reserves are typically larger than those provided by Eurocode 8 (CEN 1992b) or the AASHTO Bridge Design Specifications (AASHTO 2012). A broad comparison by Maiorana and Pellegrino (2013) of design provisions for steel bridge connections in Eurocodes and North American, Australian, and Japanese bridge standards reveals vast differences in assumptions regarding bearing/shear, slip, and minimum edge and end distances and indicated that the Eurocode provisions are the most conservative for typical steel connections in bearing and friction shear and in tension. Anitori et al. (2013) review current and proposed methods for assessing robustness and redundancy of bridge structures in Europe andNorth America; although noting that the North American provisions are more specific in this regard, they recommend that future bridge codes should be based on quantifiable measures of risk.

Over many centuries arches have been found to be aesthetically pleasing, strong, durable with very long lives, virtually maintenance free and perform well under earthquake loading. However, their initial costs are high as construction is time consuming due to the need for centring and the production of precisely cut voussoirs. As a consequence very few arch bridges have been built since the early 1900s. In response to this dilemma a patented system, the FlexiArch, which does not require centring and uses precast concrete voussoirs, has been developed. Nearly fifty FlexiArch bridges have been constructed in UK/Ireland and demonstrated that they: 1) can be installed rapidly, in less than a day rather than months 2) are cost competitive with alternative precast systems and 3) have all the attributes of masonry arches. In this paper the basic concept of the FlexiArch will be described as well as a comparison of the results of comprehensive full scale tests, up to 15m span, with methods of analysis/design used for conventional arches.

Abstract As a recent result of the modern structural mastery of developed societies, many designers concerned with aesthetics, most of them with low technical training, but with hardly any technical restriction to their creative freedom, have begun to collaborate with structural engineers. They play an increasingly important role in design teams, which are now interdisciplinary, mainly for short and medium-span bridges located in urban environments, where aesthetic quality may be a desired, or even the primary, objective. This paper is focused on understanding the complex structural behaviour of one of the most frequently built types of bridges born from this collaboration: the bridge composed of a straight deck supported by an eccentric inclined arch attached to its edge. This type of bridge was pioneered by the well-known Spanish engineer and architect Santiago Calatrava, who designed the \u2018La Devesa\u2019 footbridge. The study is carried out gradually. Firstly, the \u2018classical\u2019 arch bridge (with a vertical arch attached to the axis of the deck by means of a set of vertical hangers) is studied and taken as a reference. Then, the effect of moving laterally the vertical arch as far as the edge is described and analysed. After that, and keeping the arch attached to the edge of the deck, the effect of rotating the arch about a longitudinal axis is analysed. Finally, the effect of stiffening the hangers is discussed. The paper finishes by presenting some considerations about the structural response of these bridges and recommendations about their most suitable structural configuration.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2024902273"}}

To reduce the stress of main arch and the horizontal thrust of substructure, the new structure of T-frame with sloped plate was put forward to bear the deck loads with the assistance of main plate arch. The thin concrete walls were cast on the top sides of the main plate arch, which were decorated by fine stone with the modern decoration construction technology. The white marble railings present lively morphology with carved lotus and pomegranate on the column cap, and many kinds of flowers on the panels.

Main objective of the thesis was to build appropriate design model so that desired behaviour of the footbridge is achieved.

Supporting structure and width of walking surface make bridge a bit wider than project's demands declare. Because of supporting structure it's also more eye caching than it's supposed to be. Once the computational model was build, the loads were determined. The static analysis and design of the structure were done, which proved the safty of the bridge in the ultimate limit state.

One of the distinctive elements of the \u00c9cole des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es is that it has always created an open-minded attitude to new and interesting activities outside France. In the early 19th century, great interest was directed towards new wooden bridges structural typologies that flourished in the United States. France is drawn by the rationalization of design as a consequence of the need for standardization of the American world leading to the definition of simple, versatile, repeatable patterns. In turn the basis of structural mechanics has been developed by the French experience. The result is the beginning of a new approach to design based on structural mechanics that needs to be further developed, investigated and examined. The earliest French application of Navier\u2019s bending theory is permitted by the simplicity of the structural layout proposed and patented by Ithiel Town. Furthermore, the first applications of Navier\u2019s bending theory to practice are relative to testing procedures mainly related to existing structures and not to the design of new ones. This is not surprising considering that the typical deductive logic of the scientific procedure leads directly to the formulation of criteria for existing structures and, only at a later stage, is adapted to design needs.

Masonry arches are strong, durable, aesthetically pleasing and largely maintenance free, yet since 1900 there has been a dramatic decline in their use. However, designers, contractors and clients now have access to a new method of constructing arches incorporating precast concrete voussoirs interconnected via polymeric reinforcement and a concrete screed. No centring is necessary, as the FlexiArch, when it is lifted, transforms under the forces of gravity into the desired arch shape. After discussing general aspects of innovation, the basic concept of the arch bridge system is presented along with technological advances since it was patented. Experiences gained from building over 40 FlexiArch bridges in the UK and Ireland and from model and full-scale tests carried out to validate the system during installation and in service are described. Thus under load the system behaves like a traditional masonry arch and existing analysis methods can be used for design and assessment.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2006968351"}}

Sustainability is a holistic concept that is becoming increasingly important in the construction sector.

To overcome this problem, a life-cycle approach, integrating environmental, economic and social criteria, was developed, focusing on motorway bridges. The approach has two major perspectives: (a) an accounting perspective, and (b) a decision-making perspective. This paper presents a detailed description of the proposed methodology. It enables the design of bridges from a sustainability-based perspective. It results in an increased perception of the major problems in the life cycle of bridges and thus contributes to an improved design and lifetime behaviour, fostering the sustainability of this sector of the infrastructure.

In addition, more and more often these structures are built, not only with the single purpose of creating a walking path between two points, but as pieces of architecture that mark the landscape and contribute to an added fruition of the travel. The typically small design loads and the modern trend to optimising materials, minimising dimensions and achieving longer spans, have resulted, in recent years, in the construction of daring footbridges, marked by very high slenderness and low weight. Modern footbridges have reached spans of more than 200m.

Many of old aqueduct bridges located in rural areas are in need of repair and redesign. They still occupy some portion of countryside landscaping. However, most of them were designed to fulfill their basic functions of carrying waters, which has not contributed to the landscape positively. Moreover, it is not rational to treat each design case of aqueduct bridges individually because they are relatively small in size and arranged continuously over a long path. Therefore, it is better to provide a design guideline to repair or to redesign old aqueduct bridges as a whole considering both structural safety and landscape. The main objective is to develop a framework to repair and redesign of old aqueduct bridges for safety improvement and better landscape. Specifically this paper will address the development of possible design alternatives for repair and redesign The development of design alternatives for redesign will follow general principle of bridge aesthetics and be represented according to structural system, flume shape, pier height, pier shape in terms of design parameters while minor repair includes paintings and other ornamentations. And the developed design alternatives will be reviewed with its landscape as a background to check the visual compatibility within the community context. It is expected that the proposed guideline will be utilized to develop a maintenance plan to revitalize old aqueduct bridges to improve overall landscape of rural areas.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1995581757"}}

Many of old aqueduct bridges located in rural areas are in need of repair and redesign. They still occupy some portion of countryside landscaping. However, most of them were designed to fulfill their basic functions of carrying waters, which has not contributed to the landscape positively. Moreover, it is not rational to treat each design case of aqueduct bridges individually because they are relatively small in size and arranged continuously over a long path. Therefore, it is better to provide a design guideline to repair or to redesign old aqueduct bridges as a whole considering both structural safety and landscape. The main objective is to develop a framework to repair and redesign of old aqueduct bridges for safety improvement and better land-scape. Specifically this paper will address the development of possible design alternatives for repair and redesign The development of design alternatives for redesign will follow general principle of bridge aesthetics and be represented according to structural system, flume shape, pier height, pier shape in terms of design parameters while minor repair includes paintings and other ornamentations. And the developed design alternatives will be reviewed with its landscape as a background to check the visual compatibility within the community context. It is expected that the proposed guideline will be utilized to develop a maintenance plan to revitalize old aqueduct bridges to improve overall landscape of rural areas.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1946487884"}}

A major obstacle for pedestrians south of the Indiana-Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) campus is Coliseum Boulevard: a main arterial for the city of Fort Wayne, Indiana, which has an average daily traffic (ADT) of 50,000 vehicles. With this high ADT value, crossing by foot can not only be challenging, but can be dangerous. Thus, a pedestrian bridge over Coliseum Boulevard was proposed to allow for easy, safe travel over this busy roadway. Cohering to the innovative design concepts of both the Willis Family Bridge and the Venderly Family Bridge that already exist on the IPFW campus, the new bridge should be designed so that it too can be transformed into a landmark for the IPFW campus as the other two bridges have become. This paper presents the conceptual design of the pedestrian bridge considering four potential bridge concepts as well as the modeling, analysis and design details for the selected arch type pedestrian bridge. The selected concept for the pedestrian bridge was analyzed and designed using SAP2000 for static dead and live loads as well as for the wind loads according to AASHTO specifications and INDOT requirements.

Using innovative planning, design, and construction methods, Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) techniques reduce on-site construction time for new or replacement bridges. One aspect of ABC is Prefabricated Bridge Elements and Systems (PBES), where bridge components are fabricated off site to reduce on-site construction activities. Many state departments of transportation (DOTs) are currently making efforts to implement PBES for construction of their off-system bridges. The purpose of this research project was to investigate other states' standards and to evaluate them for possible implementation in Florida. An exhaustive search was made, and new literature was reviewed, to learn about current DOT standards and practices. The search revealed that the states with the most prefabricated bridge standards or activities are as follows: Utah, Alabama, Texas, Minnesota, and a collaboration of states. These standards were reviewed for details such as the presence of post-tensioning, joint types, design load, and inspectability. The two standard bridge types that show the most promise for adoption by Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) are Minnesota's Inverted-tee Beam, and PCI's Northeastern Extreme Tee (NEXT) Beam. A summary of the findings, including advantages and disadvantages of the bridge systems, is included in this report.

Structural design requires evaluation of the ability to transfer vertical shear force across moment-release and moment-transfer joints, longitudinal bending moments across moment-transfer joints, and for moment-release joints to accommodate rotations. Both field performance and laboratory experiments are used to evaluate the behavior of jointed pipe systems for four different diameters, two different cover depths, and response to surface loads in a variety of positions. Different approaches are investigated for analysis of the structural behavior of joints to determine thrust, moment and rotation across joints. One approach considering two beams supported by elastic springs is used to develop a simplified design procedure.

This study uses published literature, newspaper and journal articles, design competition literature, and personal interviews with key players in the bridge design community in the United States and Europe. Thorough histories and personal accounts were compiled for each case study, which included both facts and personal opinion from competition organizers and participants. Advantages and disadvantages of bridge design competitions are discussed, as well as recommendations for the future goals and ambitions of design in the United States. Discussion and conclusions address current design procurement methodologies while posing commentary on the future of bridge design. Bridge design in the United States must rise to the challenge and rival the best design communities around the world. We must break away from lowest cost designs and move toward an environment that fosters and encourages innovation, creativity, and professional debate.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1534708623"}}

As part of Maple Valley\u2019s \u201cSignature Street\u201d program, a CON/SPAN\u00ae precast arch tunnel was selected to connect a new subdivision to cross an existing jogging/equestrian trail. Residents of the subdivision now have direct access to the highway, and the structure provides two new access ramps to the King County trail. The grand opening of the bridge was celebrated with a ribbon cutting ceremony. \u201cThis new bridge helps connect the city visually and also connects people traveling by either car or by foot,\u201d said City Mayor Laure Iddings. \u201cVisually, the CON/SPAN structure echoes the other design features that the city of Maple Valley is adopting as its visual signature\u2026and this style will be repeated in future developments as well.\u201d The CON/SPAN\u00ae structure includes decorative bridge railings and end columns, landscaping enhancements and ornamental light standards and benches. The simulated rock facing on the tunnel and retaining walls mimics a natural stone appearance at 70% of the cost. Installation was completed within the city\u2019s deadline and budget.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2186387865"}}
