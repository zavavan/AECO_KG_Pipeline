Urban horticulture cropping systems offer a promising solution for food security and sustainable agriculture in rapidly urbanizing areas. This paper explores their evolving landscape, emphasizing trends and challenges shaping their development and impact on urban environments. Vertical farming, rooftop gardens, hydroponics, aeroponics, Internet of Things (IoT), integration of optimized space, resources, and year-round cultivation are considered as key trends in urban horticulture. These innovations reflect the growing interest in sustainable urban agriculture and technology's role in boosting productivity and resilience. However, urban horticulture faces challenges that demand attention. Limited space requires creative land-use solutions, while soil quality and contamination concerns necessitate remediation strategies for crop safety. Similarly, access to water is crucial, driving the adoption of water-saving technologies. The urban heat island effect poses another challenge, urging heat stress mitigation for crop health. Zoning and regulations play a vital role, requiring supportive policies and secure land tenure. High costs must be managed with innovative financial approaches to ensure urban farming's viability. Finally, public perception and awareness play a critical role. Advocacy, education, and community engagement are vital to dispel misconceptions, garner support, and encourage involvement in urban horticulture. Even with challenges, urban horticulture helps to provide food for the growing population, creates business opportunities, and contributes to a greener environment for sustainable development.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391074811"}}

In this context, community gardens are considered key topics in terms of food production and food security, in both developing and developed countries, as well as in terms of social inclusion and participation. The general aim of this study was to assess the main spatial criteria recognized and shared by stakeholders to identify suitable and inclusive areas for community gardens by testing and developing a participatory process. Because of its size, population, and urban fabric, Padua (northeast Italy) was selected as a representative and emblematic case study for mid-sized cities in Europe. The methodology was based on field surveys of key informants and spatial multicriteria decision-making analysis in the open-source geographic information system environment of QGIS. The results identified neighborhoods to be prioritized in the design of new community gardens according to three scenarios: the distance index, the social index, and the combination of the two (overall index). To conclude, this study highlighted the importance of adopting a decision-making methodology to support local policymakers and municipal agencies that are interested in implementing other community gardens in Padua.

It is evident that, due to population growth, future urbanization and urban growth are inevitable. It is estimated that the food supply demand of future urban centers will grow, which will place an additional burden on the agriculture sector to produce more food. It is projected that securing the food supply chain for future urban centers will be a challenge. Urban agriculture can be regarded as a remedy for possible future challenges that the global food system will face. It might be able to reduce the future burden on the agriculture sector. This research proposes that urban rooftop agriculture, as a subset of urban agriculture, can produce local fresh food in dense urban environments. The principal aim of this research is to suggest a series of design recommendations for architects interested in designing residential buildings capable of rooftop food production. This research attempts to highlight the specific design recommendations and the principal limitations regarding designing residential rooftop farms. To extract the data for developing the proposed design recommendations and limitations, a review of the literature within the fields of urban agriculture, building-integrated agriculture, and horticulture was conducted. Based on the literature review results, this research suggests that the following three types of farming methods can be developed on residential rooftops: (1) open-air rooftop food production, (2) \u201clow-tech\u201d rooftop greenhouses, and (3) \u201chigh-tech\u201d rooftop greenhouses. In addition, factors that can be considered principal limitations are suggested. In sum, this research proposes that current and future residential buildings can be designed so that their rooftops are utilized as farms. In this way, such buildings can contribute to delivering local fresh food to current and future metropolitan dwellers.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4392167771"}}

In the first decades of the 21st century, urban agriculture has gained attention for its role in enhancing food security, particularly in developing nations. Additionally, it is commonly assumed that urban agriculture also has positive implications for other aspects of urban sustainability, such as mitigating runoff and creating job opportunities. However, the extent of these contributions has not been extensively quantified. This study aims to address this gap by presenting a stochastic model that quantifies the contributions of urban agriculture to urban sustainability, using Sant Feliu de Llobregat, a Mediterranean city, as a case study. We assessed eight indicators, including accessibility to green areas, food self-reliance, green surface area per capita, job creation, NO2 sequestration, runoff mitigation, urban heat island effect, and volunteer participation. These indicators were estimated across twelve different simulated scenarios using 1000 Monte Carlo simulations for each scenario, to account for uncertainties. The findings revealed that the contributions of urban agriculture are not straightforward, as they are influenced by factors such as garden typology and location. Although urban agriculture typically originates as a grassroots movement, it often receives administrative support. Therefore, strategic planning can be employed to maximize the contributions of urban agriculture to urban sustainability and minimize trade-offs between social and environmental benefits.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4387835312"}}

However, a modeling framework that simulates crop growth and production potential on green roofs at a city scale is missing. Here, we adapt the Aquacrop model to explore the growth potential of various types of crops on green roofs and apply it to suitable roof areas in the city of Amsterdam. Our modeling framework includes irrigation methods for water use on green roofs that are optimized according to various climate-driven scenarios of water availability. We find that cabbage has the maximum achievable crop yields ranging from 30.8 to 75.9 t ha-1 yr-1, while pea has the minimum achievable crop yields ranging from 1.7 to 6.4 t ha-1 yr-1. The potential suitable green roof area (i.e., roofs with a certain slope and bearing capacity) for Amsterdam is roughly 400 ha for crop production. This represents 16 % of the total rooftop areas of Amsterdam and can produce up to a total of 28 kt of crops on an annual basis.

Urban areas are generally residential areas that are not considered important in terms of agricultural production. Since agricultural activities are not considered important in urban areas, cities with high population density, especially in metropolitan cities, are deprived of agricultural production areas. When considered from this point of view, cities come to the fore as places where food is consumed, sold and easily available. Although agricultural activities seem to be far from urban areas, the concepts of agriculture and city cannot be considered separately. One of the tools in question for ensuring sustainable urban development is urban agriculture. Urban agriculture is a phenomenon that enables communities in many regions to interact on many issues, beyond being a simple task. Within the scope of this study, the city area of Elazig province was examined from the perspective of urban agriculture.

A central question in this regard is how agency develops in a dynamic alignment between individual actors and collective action. Identity dynamics, as a result of social interactions at the individual and collective levels, help to understand processes vital to the functioning of local grassroots initiatives.

This mixed\u2010methods study employed questionnaires, semi\u2010structured interviews and observations across 34 urban community gardens in the city. The findings and analysis demonstrate how the urban community gardens counter neoliberal privatisation and individualisation processes. However, their capacity to function as urban commons is significantly curtailed by an entrenchment within the neoliberal context. Thus, the urban community gardens are framed as \u2018experimental\u2019 commons, a valuable re\u2010conceptualisation of alternative resource utilisation in neoliberal Southern cities.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4387973333"}}

An excursus identifies in the high-rise buildings a human archetype that today defines certain features of architecture and landscapes in the age of globalization. The second part delves into the subject of soilless agriculture in terms of agronomic technique, with the aim of understanding its origin, efficiency and potential, but also its limits and weaknesses. The analysis is carried out by investigating the production factors at play, such as land, labor and capital, in relation to the revolutions that have characterized the agricultural production sector since the 16th century. The third part analyses three different cases of vertical farms from an architectural perspective because they are alternative to each other and paradigmatic. The skyscraper model is transformed.

Abstract Urban dwellers\u2019 food and nutritional wellbeing are both dependent on infrastructure and can be indicative of wider wellbeing in urban contexts and societal health. This paper focuses on the multiple relationships that exist between food and infrastructure to provide a thorough theoretical and empirical grounding to urgent work on urban food security and nutrition in the context of rapid urban and nutrition transitions in the South. We argue that urban systems and food systems thinking have not been well aligned, but that such alignment is not only timely and overdue but also fruitful for both thematic areas of research and policy. We draw in particular on work within wider urban political economy and political ecology that can be classified as part of the \u2018infrastructural turn\u2019 that is influential with urban studies but little acknowledged within food studies. Drawing on these literatures helps us to better understand the interrelationships between people, things and ideas that make up both infrastructure and food systems. Policy, planning and research relating to both food and urban systems cannot afford to ignore such interlinkages, though much policy still operates on the neat assumptions of progressive connectivity to \u2018the grid\u2019 and formal food retail. Instead we argue how in many urban governance systems, a variety of hybrid mechanisms\u2014on and off the grid, public and private formal and informal\u2014better represent how urban residents, particularly the most marginalised, meet their everyday food and infrastructural needs along a continuum of gridded and off-grid access.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4387607459"}}

This paper critically examines why urban studies should be interested in the emergence of controlled environment agriculture. Over the last decade, there has been significant commercial and urban policy interest in controlled environment agriculture systems for producing food in enclosed environments. Furthermore, there has been a significant expansion in research publications on urban controlled environment agriculture, stressing the novel character of these systems and the complex relationships with the conventional concerns of urban agriculture. The paper subjects these claims to critical scrutiny and then reconceptualises urban controlled environment agriculture as an emergent urban infrastructure of artificial, highly productive microclimates and ecosystems for non-human life designed to increase the productive use of \u2018surplus or under-utilised\u2019 urban spaces. We argue that controlled environment agriculture tries to secure food production through three spatial\u2013temporal fixes: (1) the enclosure move \u2013 holding food closer by substituting the increasingly hostile outdoors for the controlled indoors in order to optimise yield, quality, efficiency and the \u2018cleanness\u2019 of the food; (2) the urban move \u2013 holding food closer to the city by substituting rural agricultural space for urban space to shorten supply chains and thereby help secure food production and improve its green credentials; and (3) combining 1 and 2, the urban interiorisation move \u2013 holding food yet closer still by moving food production into city buildings and intricate infrastructural systems, increasing control by securing total environments. In these ways, the paper shows how urban controlled environment agriculture selectively extends existing logics of urban and rural agriculture and identifies the future research challenges for urban studies.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4387459700"}}

We find that most Asian cities are at an early stage in efforts to apply coherent and coordinated approaches to address food-related challenges and opportunities.

In this article we propose an ecological economics orientation of peri-urban development, looking at land use planning, local food and entropy.

The concept is introduced to facilitate closing cycles, conduct spatial planning and reduce costs to achieve the ecological target of improved entropy. To this end, we look at more soundly defined metropolitan areas. An emphasis is placed on optimally assuring space for urban agriculture and on enabling recycling in ever-growing cities. Our concept is grounded in the use of peri-urban agriculture and regional food provision as an integrated system, which is based on the recycling of organic matter. Firstly, we reference current unhealthy developFfigments and show how cycles were removed as growth occurred. Secondly, as market-oriented city expansions showed limited scope for peri-urban farming, we suggest entering into regional planning.

Over the last decades, urban agriculture (UA) and controlled environmental agriculture (CEA) have been growing in many urban areas of the world to supply fresh food locally and to provide multiple benefits for the sustainable development of urban landscapes. Municipal policies and regulatory tools are increasingly employed to support UA/CEA and minimize practical challenges. However, especially in Europe, there is a lack of systematic reviews that evaluate the impacts of city-level food policies for UA/CEA and their effectiveness as perceived by local responsible actors. To address this gap, this study presents a qualitative overview of municipal policies that affect UA/CEA. We reviewed more than 83 policy documents and manuscripts and performed an online structured survey targeting key local managers or employees of UA and innovative CEA systems in four EU cities \u2013 Barcelona (Spain), Lyon (France), Trieste and Udine (Italy).

This paper offers a comprehensive review on a bibliometric analysis of the published research on the most recent generation of urban gardens. Urban gardens have been part of the cities ever since; however, the present paper focus on the latest wave of this type of garden, that has been triggered by individual bottom-up initiatives driven by sustainability-related motivations, which have an impact on cities\u2019 sustainable development. Its aim is to deliver an overview of the published scientific literature and to comprehensively review the evidence it provides on the role of urban gardens in Sustainable Development. A bibliometric analysis has been carried out using the Vosviewer software and searching the Web of Science database for \u2018urban gardens\u2019, \u2018community gardens\u2019 and \u2018allotments\u2019 as keywords. A narrow selection of the most co-cited publications on urban gardens pointed to four major strands of research grouped into four clusters. The first cluster (\u2018Citizens\u2019) groups evidence on urban gardens and \u2018People, lifestyle and sense of community\u2019. Citizens are found to be major triggers of urban gardens initiatives, driven by \u2018motivations, purposes and benefits\u2019 that are explored by a second strand of literature captured by the second cluster, the \u2018Drivers\u2019 cluster. A third group of publications addresses urban gardens in the context of the sustainable development of cities. The \u2018Cities\u2019 cluster shows how urban gardens contribute to urban sustainability as well as some aspects that can hinder it, namely not being acknowledged by local public policies and urban planners, while being neglected by urban planning policies framework. Finally, the fourth cluster (\u2018Soil\u2019) refers to sustainability shortcomings of urban gardens resulting from their being situated in vacant land that is only available due to soil contamination, which is related with its lack of institutional recognition. We were able to conclude the studies conducted are directly related to sustainable development and there are direct and necessary relationships between the three pillars and the literature on urban gardens that has been published in recent years. Besides, little importance has been given to this whole urban garden issue, not only because most of the studies reviewed in this work are case studies, but also because there is still much economic pressure affecting the sustainability pyramid.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4366258460"}}

In this study, we examined the literature on how urban agriculture under a circular economy (CE) model contributes to the development of sustainable cities. Through bibliometric and factorial analyses of the conceptual structure of the publications indexed in Scopus, we provided a brief overview of the scientific trends, impacts, and barriers. The results indicated that research on the intersection between the three themes is still in its early stages. The CE promotes networks of urban resources for their recovery and reuse for nutritional, water, and energy purposes in urban agriculture. Urban agriculture has been proposed as a nature-based solution where CE can play a vital role in enhancing the ecosystem services it provides. Although CE has not been investigated as a transversal system in the productive cycle of urban agriculture, we identified assessments of the reuse of agricultural resources. Composting, hydroponics, and vertical agriculture are the urban agriculture techniques that have been most closely associated with CE through strategies such as the use of recycled fertilizers, the incorporation of renewable sources, and the establishment of industrial symbiosis processes. Moreover, urban metabolism and life cycle assessment are crucial tools for material and energy flows. In conclusion, the synergy between CE and urban agriculture can trigger regeneration processes that transform cities in a sustainable way. Efforts toward holistic and measurable approaches to the multiple sustainable benefits generated by this synergy for cities are needed.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4389429052"}}

The history of cities and of urbanism has closely followed economic changes\u2014so much so that cities have been described as microcosms of our economic systems. As heavy contributors to climate change, pollution and the generation of waste, cities have been urged to embark on a transition to progressively become more sustainable. However, while efforts are being focused on transforming urbanism to face this challenge, urbanists are not sufficiently questioning the economic barometers they rely on. In an attempt to explain that making cities sustainable cannot emerge from relying on paradigms that create un-sustainability in the first place, this article suggests that insights from alternative approaches to economics (such as ecological economics) and to urban planning (that view cities as ecosystems) could help in understanding better what a transition toward sustainable cities could mean. Since jeopardized food security emerged from the recent Covid crisis as one of the main shortcomings of our globalized economic systems, the discussion places food systems at the core of the transition toward sustainable cities.

Abstract Gardens in cities have been the focus of a wider public health debate in Europe's polluted and dense cities, for the elderly and considering the current COVID\u201019 pandemic. Many cities report rising demand for allotment gardens by people from all age groups including young couples and families. This study aims at quantitatively examining the bundle of ecosystem services provided by allotment gardens in Berlin, Germany.

The resulting sample of 466 gardeners and 80 non\u2010gardeners shows that urban allotment gardens play an important role in food production, biodiversity conservation, but also social\u2013environmental interactions. The variety of environmental management practices, such as installation of artificial nests for insects, sowing of special flower mixtures, leaving areas with wild vegetation, use of organic fertilizers, including crop residues, shows that most respondents among gardeners are aware of the methods aimed at maintaining biodiversity and soil fertility in their allotment. The sample's analysis further states that benefits are not only perceived by gardeners but also by non\u2010gardeners.

Understanding Food\u2013Energy\u2013Water (FEW) systems is crucial in order to plan for a resilient and sustainable future of interdependent urban\u2013rural regions. While research tends to focus on urban transitions, the topic remains understudied relative to urban-rural regions. The often conflicting pressures in these regions (e.g., urbanization and growing crop production) may pose distinctive challenges where large urbanizations are adjacent to sparsely populated rural areas. These systems may further shift in response to local and global economic and demographic trends, as well as climate change. Identifying these complex system trajectories is critical for sustainability and resilience planning and policy, which requires the pooling of both urban and rural expertise across multiple disciplines and domains. We convened panels of subject matter experts within a participatory causal loop diagramming (CLD) approach. Our workshops were facilitated by our research team to collaboratively construct the web of connections among the elements in the urban\u2013rural FEW system. The CLDs and the discussions around them allowed the group to identify potentially significant lever points in the system (e.g., support for minority farmers to enhance food security while reducing waste), barriers to sustainability (e.g., laws restricting the sale of water treatment biosolids), and potential synergies across sectors (e.g., food and green energy advocacy jointly pressing for policy changes). Despite the greater understanding of urban\u2013rural interdependence afforded by participatory CLD, urban factors were consistently prioritized in the representation of the integrated system, highlighting the need for new paradigms to support sustainable urban\u2013rural transitions.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4322504322"}}

Abstract In recent years, a growing number of citizen\u2010led gardens have appeared in the urban public spaces of large cities across the world. While many of these projects are initially launched informally without any support from the state, they gradually become integrated into the social fabric of the city. To understand the evolution of the formal\u2013informal boundaries of the practice, we argue that we should be paying attention to the specific institutional contexts that frame gardeners\u2019 interactions with public authorities. Drawing from a study of citizen\u2010led gardens in Mexico City, we show that informal urban gardening becomes a disconnected\u2010from\u2010the\u2010state practice. On the one hand, the Mexico City government has shown a growing interest in regulating urban agriculture. On the other hand, gardeners are increasingly trying to find their own ways to formalize and perennate their practice. We suggest that this disconnection between gardeners and the state is best explained by the weakness of the institutional context in which their interactions take place. A top\u2010down policymaking process, along with the incapacity and unwillingness of the multi\u2010leveled city government to implement policies effectively, reinforces norms of mistrust and generates low expectations among gardeners as they interact with local authorities.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4321101770"}}

It first situates the contemporary concept of the productive city within a broader historical dialogue of foundational figures in urban and regional planning, architecture, and landscape architecture for whom food production was a central component of future cities. Recently, a growing number of practitioners have theorized the need for integrating urban agriculture in urban design and planning. Across this spectrum of emerging theory and practice, we identify three approaches to designing productive cities. First, spatial design strategies identify new territories for food production. These offer the potential for systems design thinking that links the individual spaces of production to other sectors of food systems that extend across networks of spaces and multiple scales. Finally, both spatial and systems design involve strategies of designing productive infrastructures of soils, water, nutrients, and other essential flows. The engagement with spaces of production, food systems, and productive infrastructure opens up a range of challenges as well as opportunities for emerging forms of practice and design thinking for the productive city.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4319081225"}}

Abstract Urban agriculture is the key to creating healthy cities and developing resilient urban food systems in uncertain times. However, relevant empirical evidence is limited. This study quantitatively verified the association of access to local food through urban agriculture with subjective well-being, physical activity, and food security concerns of neighborhood communities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The target was Tokyo, Japan, where small-scale local food systems are widespread in walkable neighborhoods. We found that diversity in local food access, ranging from self-cultivation to direct-to-consumer sales, was significantly associated with health and food security variables. In particular, the use of allotment farms was more strongly associated with subjective well-being than the use of urban parks, and it was more strongly associated with the mitigation of food security concerns than the use of food retailers. These findings provide robust evidence for the effectiveness of integrating urban agriculture into walkable neighborhoods.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4318820057"}}

This paper responds to the research question, &amp;ldquo;can urban farming help Nepali cities become more sustainable&amp;rdquo;? Especially after the Covid-19 pandemic, urban residents have begun to realize that food transported from long distances could not always be reliable. Urban farming can help produce fresh food locally and avoid long-distance transportation, and refrigeration. This practice also helps reduce greenhouse gases through plant carbon use efficiency (CUE). Urban farming not only helps city-dwellers towards achieving self-reliance in food production but also in vegetation carbon dynamics (VCD) while supporting the circular economy. Urban farming consists of edible landscapes, which can also be an aesthetic public space. As urban lands command higher prices than agricultural land, urban farming usually happens on residential yards, roofs, balconies, community gardens, and dedicated areas in public parks. Rainwater harvesting, and redirecting can help irrigate urban farms which can be part of rain gardens. The national census of 2021 (CBS 2022, p5) identifies that 66 percent of Nepal&amp;rsquo;s population live in urban areas. However, the World Bank (2018), shows that only 21 of Nepal&amp;rsquo;s population was projected to live in urban areas in 2021. It is not debatable that the urbanization process in Nepal is on the rise. Thus, urban agriculture can play an important role to supplement the residents&amp;rsquo; food needs. Many cities in Nepal have already successfully adapted to urban farming where residents grow food on their building site, balconies, and rooftop often growing plants on pots, vases, and other types of containers. The UN-Habitat, with the support of European Union and local agencies, has published a rooftop farming training manual (2014) showing the feasibility of urban farming in Nepal.The paper discusses how Public Private Partnership (PPP) can promote urban agriculture and make the process more effective and attractive to urban farming households.

The paper will provide recommendations for Nepali cities to maximize the benefit provided by urban farming.

This means that urban resource use and waste is difficult to see. Cities are often acknowledged as physical spaces, however the concept of urban metabolism offers a different perspective, visualising them by quantified and interconnected inputs and outputs to reveal what cannot be seen by the human eye.

Until the nineteenth century, American urban dwellers cohabited with livestock and cities formed ecologically diverse spaces. In the late nineteenth century, a series of urban livestock policies coupled with industrial agricultural transformations displaced livestock to urban fringes and rural areas. These developments radically altered human\u2013animal relationships in the urban context, limited economic opportunity and over time have shaped contemporary issues of food access and food justice within cities. Post-industrial cities in the United States, such as Detroit, are characterised by patterns of urban shrinkage and high levels of vacancy. Within this context, urban farming has emerged as a framework and movement to stabilise communities, address local food access and leverage vacancy towards new models of occupation. In 2013, the City of Detroit Urban Agricultural Ordinance was passed to formalise decades of community-driven urban agricultural practices. The ordinance provides guidelines for urban farms and gardens and for managing allied resources. Deliberation on urban agriculture and livestock ordinances continues today. While existing policies provide a framework for food-based development of neighbourhoods, they remain focused on the incremental scale of existing single-family housing and adjacent vacant plots versus larger assemblages that may participate in the production of new urban collectives and assemblages.

Beyond the benefits of producing food and other resources, urban agriculture can be understood as a microsystem embedded in macro-scale economic, social, ecological and infrastructural systems of the city. This framing as embedded in the urban \u2018system\u2019 challenges cities to address urban agriculture not as a discrete activity, but as an important component of infrastructure and urban planning. I argue that there are innovative options across low to high tech approaches if we contextualize landscape types across the urban gradient. This chapter aims to categorize diverse opportunities across 10 landscape types for multifunctional urban land uses that integrate agriculture. Multifunctional land uses that integrate agriculturally productive landscapes will be a critical adaptation for the sustainability of future cities.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4317435297"}}

Abstract In the past decade, urban agriculture (UA) has attracted significant attention from urban planners and city managers as a sustainable, nature-based, and smart solution that may generate positive impacts for resilience, self-reliance, and social, economic, and environmental sustainability of cities. UA appears as an effective means to address climate change while also fostering urban transitions to sustainability in many ways, such as creating new commons, amenities, ecosystem services, reinventing urbanity, and encouraging community building by growing local food. Since UA is a strategy to support the re-configuration of more sustainable and resilient cities, it can be considered a seedbed for innovation. Based on these premises, the STRutture Agricole MEtropolitane (STRAME) research project aims at defining an innovative interpretation of the urban farming. The research proposes a vision of the UA based on an intermediate scale compared to the more investigated and developed mega-scale of large vertical farming and the microscale of urban gardens. Conceived as an adaptive infrastructure, STRAME\u2014a system based on modular Vertical Farming units\u2014is organized to be translated and applied in different urban and metropolitan scenarios.

STRAME, starting from deep analysis of the background of UA, aims at defining a physical infrastructure integrated with a digital infrastructure (IoT), able of responding to the challenges posed by the agro-industrial chain in densely populated urban contexts. Its core is a system of modular elements to be used for the construction and commissioning of a medium-sized network of inter-connected vertical farming applicable in residual voids and in the open spaces in large residential districts.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4382723504"}}

In the 1970s, the city started redefining its relation to agriculture by integrating various forms of urban agriculture. Today, the city is known for its strong network of community gardens, educational farms, and job training programs. Over the last decade, the city has also attracted various entrepreneurial controlled environment production facilities, such as hydroponic greenhouses, rooftop greenhouses, and vertical indoor farms using innovative growing methods and economic models. Other urban farms deploy hybrid models that combine a robust social agenda with emerging, economically-driven food production systems. These multi- layer urban agriculture operations with strong community and commercial objectives contribute to community empowerment and urban revitalization.

First, the strategic design involves the landscape potentials, such as environmental conditions, for growing food. Secondly, the conceptual design integrates urban systems of material flows, which supply and reuse resources for the growth of food.

(2) Is there a legislative framework that supports the production of fresh food in urban context? (3) Is fresh food affordable for the most vulnerable populations in the metropolitan? We found that existing development patterns and lack of mobility, especially in peri-urban zones, do not provide conditions for a healthy diet while processed and ready-to-go food is easy to reach. Long travel distances, as well as marginalization, hinder access to healthy food. While Mexico City has set up public policies to support urban agriculture in the city, such legislative framework and support is largely absent in the metropolitan periphery \u2013 a condition that further enhances inequality and precariousness on the urban fringe. Finally, food is more affordable in informal settings and in the periphery than in inner-city neighborhoods.

Supermarkets are a ubiquitous building typology in the UK and Ireland. Typically, they are described as a big-box store filled with trolleys, aisles, and checkouts, situated out-of-town with a dedicated car park. They are rarely admired for their architectural character, yet they are culturally significant spaces because we buy most of our food from them. Supermarkets have perfected an efficient and convenient system for selling food, but this current model is far from perfect: in fact, it\u2019s precarious, murky, monopolistic, and unhealthy for both people and the planet. Despite this, it is hard to imagine a radically more sustainable food shopping model that could fully replace it because they rely on a complex, locked-in food system. Therefore, imagining a new typology requires a new approach; one that reframes it as an interface to wider social, technical, economic, ecological, and political systems. In doing so, the space and food system are holistically reimagined to achieve better alternatives for both. Much like Reyner Banham\u2019s seminal text, A Home is not a House \u2013 a supermarket is not just a building; it\u2019s also a meeting space, a waste producer, a refrigeration node, a public health actor and much more. In the race to net-zero, thinking and designing in this way, reframing the supermarket from building to an interface, opens opportunities to reveal previously unconsidered climate transition pathways. Through research-by-design methods and the application of systems thinking, this chapter uses the supermarket as a case study to imagine new ways of seeing and redesigning architectural typologies in the context of a rapid climate transition. In the text, the supermarket is first defined from an architectural standpoint, then in its relationship as an interface to wider local and global systems. This informs a thematic lens-based investigation through which a climate resilient and sustainable supermarket is imagined.

The patterns underlying the provision of AG plots and facilities to users in Tokyo are unclear. Thus, this study quantitatively examines the characteristics of different types of AG provision and their determinants in the metropolitan region of Tokyo. We classified a sample of 313 AGs gathered from governmental open data via a non-hierarchical cluster analysis of AG provision patterns based on their properties, including number of plots, plot size, contract price and duration, and facilities such as agricultural equipment and access to instructors. Moreover, we examined the influence of urban development and residential characteristics on these classes using the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test.

Urban agriculture has considerable potential to be developed. This study aims to determine the potential for developing urban farming in Yogyakarta. Analysis was carried out through quantitative descriptive supported by primary and secondary data. The results showed that urban farming activities were carried out through the cultivation of vegetables, fruit plants, medicinal plants, ornamental plants, fish cultivation, product processing and marketing. Efforts to develop urban farming in the city of Yogyakarta have good potential. Urban farming activities have the potential to be developed into agricultural, educational and tourism activities.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4388659680"}}

In the 21st century, humanity is facing unprecedented climate and food crises caused by population growth, urbanization, environmental pollution, and carbon emissions. As a response to the climate and food crisis, the following concept has emerged: smart urban agriculture that can reduce carbon emissions from buildings and achieve self-sufficiency in food. Various architectural designs that include smart farms are being explored worldwide. Nevertheless, the concept does not seem to have gained sufficient popular traction. This study attempted to materialize the concept by presenting types and characteristics from an architectural planning and design perspective by examining cases of smart farm constructions worldwide. After collecting 171 smart farm cases from around the world and building a database in terms of city, architecture, environment, and crops, the types were classified through SOM analysis, an artificial neural network-based cluster analysis methodology. As a result of the analysis, smart farm types were classified into seven types, and the characteristics of architectural planning and design were extracted for each type. It is meaningful that a specific form was presented so that planning and design can be easily accessed according to the situation placed through the type of smart farm.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4313472271"}}

The impacts of global climate change on food systems will be broad, complex, and profoundly affected by urban context. Food-related urbanism has been investigated for decades to explore how food access influences placemaking and urban forms. With global climate change, foodscapes within urban spaces are an important consideration in urban design and planning for food security and community health. The distribution of catering businesses (restaurants and caf\u00e9s), one critical method of access to food, is highly associated with urban spaces because of their high impact on diet patterns, human physical activities, travel behaviors, and the use of public spaces. This research explores the spatial associations that exist between the distribution of catering businesses and the design and planning of urban spaces in London. This quantitative research includes three parts: (1) uses Open Street Map data and the GIS spatial analysis method to study the distribution of catering businesses; (2) uses the imagery segmentation method in machine learning to categorize urban spaces into open, landscape, and conflict spaces; and (3) establishes the association between the distribution of catering businesses and the categories of urban spaces through Spearman\u2019s correlation and a linear regression model. The results indicate that the spatial distributions of catering businesses are highly correlated with urban spaces. Conflict and landscape spaces have a significant positive influence on the distribution of catering businesses, while open space has a significant negative influence.

The German city of Bamberg offers lessons in how continuity and change interact within the context of the inner-urban land use of commercial horticulture, thereby informing sustainable urban transformations in historic cities. The case of Bamberg shows that urban food production is not just well-established, but a consistent and centuries-old cultural structure that influences the fabric of today\u2019s city. In this article, we discuss what forms of urban horticulture (and thus also food production) are evident from Bamberg\u2019s past and which may prevail in the future. Two questions structure our analysis. First, how are historical sites and spatial structures of horticulture shaped in the tension between continuity and change? Second, which practices/forms of urban horticulture are taken up and how are they updated by which actors? Both the heritage and contemporary practices of urban horticulture, it is argued, can be conceived of as a resource to create sustainable places and ways of life for citizens. Two new contributions result from this work. First, the article highlights the ongoing cultural heritage dimensions of urban horticulture in a field still dominated by eco-technical contributions associated with post-industrial innovation in urban planning; in this respect, heritage should be recognised as a dynamic that shapes urban change.

Influenced by the long historical evolution and intensification of various risks, food production in urban areas involves the widest multifunctionality to date. Therefore, the aim of this research is to identify the main functions of urban agriculture and to evaluate their significance in Latvia. The following tasks were set to achieve the aim: 1) to identify and classify functions of urban agriculture, 2) to analyse the performance and significance of functions in Latvia. Several methods were employed to perform tasks and achieve the aim: the monographic and descriptive methods for making a theoretical discussion; the analysis, synthesis and deduction methods for obtaining information, systematisation and classification of functions; a structured expert interview for rating and ranking functions and identifying interactions between them. The research identified 14 functions of urban agriculture, which were classified into 5 groups: political, economic, social, environmental and technological. The most significant functions of urban agriculture in Latvia are social (promotion of social cohesion and public health, education and maintaining traditions and values) and technological innovations. There are interactions between all functions, and support for urban sustainability, education, provision of ecosystem services and technological innovations have the strongest impact on other functions.

The concept of a regenerative city goes far beyond a sustainable one. The regenerative approach is to think of urban green space as a productive landscape, a source of food, and a support for biodiversity. In this approach, the so-called urban wastelands have a positive significance. Urban agriculture (UA) has become a commonly discussed topic in recent years with respect to sustainable development. Therefore, the combination of urban fabric and local food production is crucial for ecological reasons. The key issues are the reduction of food miles and the demand for processed food, the production of which strains the natural environment. At the same time, UA enables regeneration and restoration. An original methodological approach was used in the study following the mixed-method research concept: literature survey, case studies, and comparative analysis of objects. A review of UA architecture (UAA) projects was carried out to supplement the knowledge acquired during the bibliometric analysis. In sum, 25 existing projects, including allotment gardens, community gardens, and urban farms in the global north, were compared in this study. As a result of the analyses carried out, the breakdown of urban agriculture was developed into the following categories: (i) architectural-urban, (ii) ecological, (iii) social, and (iv) economic, including the impact of UA on physical activity and social interaction. UA is also a factor shaping the urban landscape. In conclusion, agrarian practice in urban environments has led to the creation of a new type of space, known as UAA. Production in the context of UA exceeds private goods, such as food produced for sale or for individual use. Additional goods include public goods. The review shows that UA fulfills economic, social, and environmental functions, thus falling under the concept of sustainable development.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4309852318"}}

In this paper we explore how policy discourses on urban sustainability impact the governing of urban food gardening in favoring community gardens. Our main hypothesis is that community gardens better accommodate the tensions created by the discourses of the compact and green city compared to other types of food gardening, especially allotment gardens. In the context of the Swiss cities of Lausanne and Zurich, analysis of policy documents confirms this hypothesis by identifying four frames that orient policies toward favoring community gardening: (i) Adapting green space planning to densification favors community gardening with their modest, flexible and multifunctional design, (ii) Revaluating the role of urban food gardening in urban sustainability represents community gardening as a new multifunctional benchmark, (iii) Reorganizing urban food gardening fosters diversity in gardening opportunities which in turn supports a variety of forms of community gardening, (iv) Justifying urban food gardening through public values and needs supports community gardening with their cost-efficient green space management, lower land management and more active citizen participation. In this vein, urban policymakers continually turn to community gardens as a strategic urban planning tool that gives urban green space greater legitimacy in the wake of the densifying city. Overall, urban food gardens continue to be negotiated between space-related marginalization and socio-political significance serving different needs to urban citizens. This results in the need of a more sophisticated planning approach considering different types of urban gardens related to their location in the built city, associated functions, and user groups.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4323529167"}}

The main objective of this work is to analyze the periurban agri-food systems of the urban agglomeration of Sousse (Tunisia), one of the most important in the country, from a landscape perspective. This work adds to the literature on policies and strategies for the planning and development of Tunisian cities, which are currently facing several environmental and social challenges, of which climate change, food security and sustainable development are the most important. This research focuses, as mentioned above, on the case of the urban agglomeration of Sousse (Tunisia), where the concurrence of different factors (political, environmental, economic, etc.), together with clearly deficient regulations and uncontrolled urban development, is threatening the survival of a traditional, largely family-based agricultural model, based on a mixed or polyculture production system, with olive groves predominating. The latter is vital to ensure the economic maintenance of many families and to actively contribute to food security, with the consequent production of varied, fresh, and quality food.

Social outcomes are represented by the level of gardeners' satisfaction and perceptions of their success.

This study employs Ostrom's socio-ecological systems (SES) framework that reflects both social and natural aspects of community gardening and explains the connection between the governance approaches, gardeners' perception of their success, and changes in carbon sequestration. This paper uses a mixed-methods approach with key informant interviews with managers of community gardens yielding both qualitative and quantitative data. Remote sensing analysis is applied to calculate the amount of biomass for the carbon sequestration model using remote sensing imagery from the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) and Planet Inc. The analysis reveals that the highest measurements of the social and ecological performance in community gardens in Austin are associated with 'bottom-up' governance structures where community members are in charge of decision-making and management.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4309048108"}}

Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) is widely distributed throughout the Global South. Despite urban population growth and diversifying food habits, UPA delivers an important part of urban food supply, as well as other types of services to cities, such as employment and waste reuse. Nevertheless, the extent and importance of UPA varies between different urban areas, while challenges like limited recognition, land conversion, and water pollution and competition threaten the potential of UPA to contribute to urban resilience. Key investment priorities for research and innovation for overcoming current challenges include incentivized peri-urban zoning, urban allocation of productive lands, and increasing capacities for controlled environment agriculture (CEA). Innovative repositioning of food marketing can help to strengthen supply of healthy food from UPA production, increase decent employment, and turn food markets into nutrition hubs. Priority innovations for contributing to the circular bioeconomy of cities include scaling the safe use of wastewater for irrigation through investments in the adoption of multiple risk-barrier approaches and scaling UPA-based ecosystem services for valorising solid waste and environmental management. Innovations in urban governance are required to support these processes by bringing food systems into urban planning through food mapping and the multisectoral platforms for dialogue and policy formulation across city regions and with vertical levels of government.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4308710457"}}

Abstract Urban transformations in secondary cities in sub-Saharan Africa have sparked renewed interest in local food. This chapter is based on a desktop study to explore the urban agriculture (UA) experiences of three very different secondary urban centres (Ndola, Nakuru, and Karoi). In the three urban centres while poverty is the driving force for some low-income urban farmers, other households have engaged in the activity for entrepreneurial purposes. UA in the open spaces in these three secondary urban centres is creating tension between urban developers and both resource-rich and resource-poor households. Also, rapid secondary urbanization is presenting food insecurity challenges through the displacement of urban food producers on one hand and the disruption of urban food production systems on the other hand. Urban planners in African secondary cities should find ways to understand and address these tensions in locally responsive ways that can optimize the benefits to poor households and improve the sustainability of their urban food systems.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4307977155"}}

Abstract Co-production, a strategy increasingly being adopted by urban planners, has potential for protecting and expanding urban food security. Its goals go beyond those of participation to include substantive sharing in policy design, implementation and monitoring: shifting some power associated with these decisions and actions to primary stakeholders. Co-production is desirable for empowerment outcomes, and also on grounds of greater efficiency, cost savings and more locally informed planning. Slum/Shack Dwellers International (SDI) is a lead actor in co-production and has partnered with the Government of Uganda, working on pro-poor urban development projects underway in several secondary cities, including Jinja and Mbale. SDI frames slum dweller advocacy in a rights-based discourse with provisions that informal settlement residents articulate their own priorities. Given food access is a central priority of the urban poor, co-production creates opportunities to address urban food insecurity. However, governments, including municipal and national governments in Uganda, resist genuine power sharing with urban slum dwellers. This research explores how co-production engages slum dwellers and governance actors in the secondary cities of Jinja and Mbale, Uganda. It seeks to understand the possibilities and limitations of the current SDI co-productive programing in the context of urban food security.

The high level of heterogeneity and complexity of these areas are particularly challenging in terms of understanding the ongoing processes and their drivers, including the effects of spatial interactions, in order to make an initial assessment of the possible levers for territorial management. We aim to show a new modeling approach to assess the factors explaining farming system trajectories on Mediterranean peri-urban areas, including an analysis of the spillover from neighboring areas, which is often neglected in these kinds of methods. The model was tested in two urban regions, located in Pisa (Italy) and Avignon (France), leading to very different perspectives, given the differences in terms of farming systems and environmental characteristics. Our model also highlights the factors acting on peri-urban farming system trajectories. We first analyzed the farming systems characteristics and their trajectories, based on a land parcel identification system database and agricultural census. Then, we estimated explanatory factors at the farm level applying a spatially explicit model which takes into spatial autocorrelations into account: a Spatial Autoregressive Probit model. Our results provide new evidence supporting the hypothesis that peri-urban farming systems trajectories are influenced by other variables than the distance to the city center and the urbanization processes. Although urban sprawl characterizes medium-sized regions, this factor is not relevant on farming systems trajectories in the region of Pisa, where structural agro-pedoclimatic drivers contribute more significantly to the probability of change and, therefore, highlighting the greater stability of these farming systems. The region of Avignon reveals different aspects: a dense road infrastructure and favorable environmental conditions (availability of irrigation water during warm periods, adequate temperatures in winter, deep soils) increase the probability of intensification within the farming system. Our methodological approach, which is based on a spatial probit model, measures the effect of the spatial dependence of the dependent variables.

This study used remote sensing to map home (N = 478) and community (N = 130) gardens across Detroit, an emblematic legacy city undergoing significant redevelopment. Despite being a city in which seventy-eight percent of the residents are Black, spatial regression revealed that gardens in Detroit are actually more prevalent in non-Black-neighborhoods. Community gardens predominate in neighborhoods where residents are younger, wealthier, and college-educated, while home gardens are more numerous in areas with high rates of home ownership.

Contrary to the literature, we did not find a correlation between the presence of gardens and potential gentrification. Gardens, however, are consistently more prevalent in neighborhoods that have stabilized after experiencing high rates of vacancy, foreclosure, and housing demolition. These results have three important implications.

The introduction of this approach in urban ecosystems is difficult due to the complexity of knowledge and principles that should be developed to design an agroecological system. In this framework, ICT could provide some useful tools to enhance the competencies of dwellers to practice agroecology within cities. In this regard, the chapter explores which role agroecology could play in smart cities. Specifically, it investigates how ICT could spread agroecological approaches in order to boost urban agriculture in cities. Finally, the chapter explores how smart urban agriculture tends to guarantee food sovereignty and the maintenance of ecosystem services.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4284679306"}}

Abstract Urban populations globally are expected to increase by approximately 2.5 billion by 2050. Much of this growth is taking place in African cities, where about 40% of Africans live in urban areas with populations of less than 250,000. In many of these cities, rapid urban growth has outpaced economic and social development, resulting in high levels of urban poverty and widespread food insecurity. As one response strategy, urban households may leverage their linkages with rural areas and other towns or cities to supplement their food consumption, for example through food remittances or food purchases from remote retailers. While this strategy has been found to occur among inhabitants of large cities where existing research on urban food systems and urban food linkages with other areas has focused, the dynamics in smaller cities are likely different. In this paper, we draw on data from 837 surveys collected in 2021 to investigate household food sourcing strategies across 14 urban areas in Zambia with populations less than 100,000. We find that rural-urban food linkages are dominated by grains while urban-urban food linkages are predominantly composed of higher value foods. Our data further suggest that urban area characteristics explain more of the variability in food sourcing behaviors than household level characteristics, and that urban food purchasing preferences in secondary urban areas are sensitive to the food retail landscape available to households. These relationships highlight the disparate role that rural and urban linkages play across cities of different sizes. They suggest a need for food-related policies to consider diverse urban food systems among smaller cities.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4292092899"}}

In Latvia urban agriculture does not have a legally defined status, it is not defined in strategic development plans, nor in the laws and regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyse the legal aspects of urban agriculture in order to determine its potential institutional framework in Latvia. To achieve the goal, tasks of the research are defined: 1) to identify the main legal aspects affecting urban agriculture in Latvia, 2) to determine the potential institutional framework for urban agriculture in Latvia. The study was conducted using systematic review analysis of laws, development strategies and regulations of the Republic of Latvia.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, cities around the world have gone through terrible ordeals. These include a lack of urban resilience in emergency response, food supply, institutional cooperation, economic support, etc. Meanwhile, many urban and global problems have been amplified by the pandemic's impacts on food security issues, the long-term sustainability of food systems, and so on. In response to the recovery agenda of the post-COVID 19 era, rebuilding urban resilience and sustainability through the pathways of sustainable urban food system development has great potential. It is evident that food supports the fundamental needs of people's health and well-being, but cities account for most food consumption, waste, and greenhouse gas emissions. Starting from these considerations, this study investigates how urban agriculture can improve the sustainability and resilience of the urban food system through the analysis of the existing literature. Conducted on April 11, 2022, on the Web of Science database, this literature review includes bibliographic coupling, co-citation analysis, and co-occurrence analysis to map knowledge regarding the role of urban agriculture practices in fostering both urban food systems' 'sustainability' and 'resilience'.

A critical data-analysis of public land transactions in the Ghent city region (Belgium). The development of urban food policies has shed light on the strategic role of public landownership for strengthening farmers capacities in the context of rising land values. Despite attention on a few pioneering farming initiatives promoted by local authorities on public farmland, however, there is often little understanding of the extent of public landownership and the modus operandi of public institutions within urban land markets. This makes it hard to assess how representative these \u2018pioneering\u2019 projects are and whether or not they are embedded in coherent urban agendas. The city region of Ghent (Belgium) offers an exemplary case: internationally celebrated for its innovative urban food policy, its administration is at the centre of controversies with farmers and grassroots movements who denounced the large-scale sell-off of historical public farmland in the city region. Using Belgian Land Registry data, this paper constructs a unique, empirically grounded, cartography of public landownership and public land transaction for the Ghent city region. The results expose deep contradictions in public policy and demonstrate the continuation of an urbanism disconnected from agricultural concerns. They also provide tools for reshaping the management of public land aligned to urban food policy goals, in and beyond the Ghent city region.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4288077347"}}

Urbanisation is continuously increasing the demand for food within cities while separating the users from its source. This disconnect creates the need for food packaging, which is disposed of as soon as we consume the food within, without further thought of the environmental harm the waste will cause. This thesis uses architecture to create a food-related experience that celebrates the objects of food and waste, through edible horticulture. The design aims to provoke human consideration towards sustainable consumption, through bodily interaction with the planting. A \u2018design-as-research\u2019 methodology is used to explore the proposition, through an iterative process with critical reflection upon each design outcome to refine the design. Alongside the design process, \u2018research-for-design\u2019 is also undertaken. A literature review and case study analysis provide a theoretical and pragmatic context for the relationship between humans and the objects of food and waste within the city architecture. The thesis then moves into three design stages, which increase in scale. The first exploration is an installation-scale, creating a 1:500 abstract city model integrating urban horticulture derived from waste found on-site. The mid-scale experiment introduces a programme of a vertical infill garden and urban eatery within a food-producing architecture to reconnect users with their food source. The final design experiment creates a gardening assemblage system of pavilions connecting to a biogas infrastructure, integrating food producing architecture with waste management.

Impermaculture is a model of urban agriculture whereby some urban farmers approach their impermanence \u2013 the possibility of their operations being replaced by higher value developments \u2013 less as a threat to be avoided, as traditionally understood in the literature, and more as an intended modus operandi to which they are committed. We discuss how they use lightweight and portable growing containers, planter beds, greenhouses, and livestock pens to operate within and enhance contemporary regimes of development in global North cities. We identify a spatio-temporal impermanence that stands in contrast to classic understandings of sustainability fixes as either a form of greenwashing or as spatial fixes involving the sinking of capital into construction of a \u2018greener\u2019 built environment. In what follows, we develop a conceptual framework that will facilitate these contributions and provide a language for discussing cases of impermaculture in Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, British Columbia. We discuss how urban agriculture is mobilized as part of the sustainability fix in the two cities. We first demonstrate how impermaculture emerges as a means of stabilizing the fix which is always prone to coming apart, or fracturing. We then draw on two examples \u2013 goat husbandry in Portland and temporary gardens in Vancouver \u2013 to demonstrate how urban agriculturalists are embracing and leveraging impermanence.

We do so by documenting the experiences of urban growers who cultivate, eat, and distribute indigenous greens (haakh) in the city of Srinagar in the Himalayan belt of Jammu and Kashmir, the site of a protracted conflict. Experiences of growers were analyzed within the context of the city's complex urban planning landscape. Empirical methods included qualitative interviews of urban growers (n = 40) and review of land use plans and policies. We found that haakh production ensured access to affordable, nutritious, and culturally celebrated greens for haakh growing households.

This chapter focuses on the issue of regional resourcefulness for food systems. It considers urban areas to be vital linkages for food production systems that need to close the loop in order to prevent the depletion of natural resources. Urban areas generate large \u2018sources\u2019 of residual material and waste flows that contain nutrients and organic matter that currently only partly return to the food system. These flows thus offer perspectives on \u2018circular valorisation\u2019, either recycling or replacing other (partly fossil) resources. Urban areas therefore represent attractive starting points in a transition towards circularity and to connect rural and urban flows. In this chapter we look at the transition needed in the use of phosphorus (P), essential for life and an integral part of our food system. P is a finite resource, obtained by mining. Reserves are limited; estimates of global reserves vary between 100 and several hundred years. This chapter discusses two case studies and focuses on urban-rural flows of P. The first case explores the potential of a circular food system at the regional scale of Almere. Almere is a Dutch city, part of the Metropolitan Region of Amsterdam (MRA). It was selected because of its location adjacent to a large agricultural hinterland, the Flevo Polder. The central question of this case study is: what does a circular City Region Food System with regional food production look like from the perspective of P-flows? How much land is needed to feed the urban area and to what extent can the urban P-flow be recirculated to agriculture? The second case study explores an actual urban P-flow: what are the actual quantities of the P-flows and to what degree is the P-loop already closed? These questions are addressed in a study that encompassed the entire MRA region. The chapter concludes that a circular City Region Food System is technically feasible. However, a fundamental shift is required in how the food and waste systems are organised: from farm to fork and from disposal to dung. Hence, it ends with recommendations on how to enhance circular urban food production that does not deplete but preserves P.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4282825313"}}

If form follows function, as states the oft quoted proverb of design credited to Louis Sullivan, then perhaps as much attention should be given to the design of the function as the form. What this treatise will demonstrate is that function designed around a concept can result in physical manifestations, or forms, of that concept. In this case a concept was applied to a community development project. The project in turn created physical manifestations of the concept. The focus of this work is on a project begun in 1996 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The concept underlying the Baton Rouge project was to use active stewardship of the land and its people as a means of promoting economic and community development. This concept was put into practice through the creation of the Baton Rouge Economic and Agricultural Development Alliance, or BREADA, the function of which is to foster stewardship of land and community. Among the most evident forms borne of the concept and BREADA are the Red Stick Farmers' Market, the community garden project, and the recently-created Main Street Market in downtown Baton Rouge. Examination of the Baton Rouge project lead to a second premise. The concept that drives the design of the function and form can also guide the creation of the conditions necessary to produce the desired function and form.

United States cities have developed urban agri\u00adculture support systems with different priorities and institutional structures, with significant impacts and implications for social equity and justice. Some treat farming and gardening as public goods, public spaces, valued for their community-building, environmental and public health promotion, and other social benefits.

These represent divergent, often opposing expectations of what urban agriculture can yield, and what it should be, often present in the same city. This article, a combination of mixed methods research and reflection, traces the evolution of urban agriculture practice, support, and policy in Philadelphia and Chicago since the 1990s.

Diverse aspects of de-agrarianization, which is manifested by the cessation or significant reduction in agricultural activities, have been clearly visible at the outskirts of large cities in Central Europe in recent decades. The key drivers behind this process include increased pressures to cover peri-urban agricultural land by new developments, inadequate protection of agricultural land, ineffective implementation of urban planning policies, low recognition of the importance of agriculture, and overall changes in people\u2019s dietary habits. Urbanization pressures undoubtedly belong to the factors intensifying overall de-agrarianization, as urban farmers are usually not able to compete with other urban functions. This article focuses on more in-depth understanding of the driving forces behind de-agrarianization processes that are specific to post-socialist cities. As a case study, Brno, a second-tier city in the Czech Republic, was selected. In the first part, the conceptual framework and drivers of de-agrarianization are discussed specifically for the case of large Central European post-socialist cities. In the next part, we explore by means of a set of qualitative interviews the case study of the regeneration of the area of a former Cistercian monastery in Brno that was traditionally used for agricultural purposes, but recently was redeveloped for a university campus. Our findings signal procedural issues connected to the preservation of architectural heritage during the regeneration that frequently end up with only fragments being preserved. We also demonstrate a decline in the use of urban agricultural properties that are hastily transformed into a new urban environment under extremely strong urbanization pressures. We argue that even in economically prosperous cities with highly neoliberal competition between possible urban land uses, agriculture must be considered a relevant and highly important urban function and more protected by planning tools.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4281829435"}}

Urban agriculture provides a range of ecosystem services (as well as potential disservices). This study examines the spatial extent, physical characteristics, and residents' perceptions of community and private gardens in Detroit, a city that has high potential for agricultural development given its abundant vacant and abandoned land. Despite popular narratives of Detroit as a mecca for urban agriculture, spatial analysis of the city's Lower Eastside (~15 sq. miles) reveals that gardens cover less than 1% of the vacant land and are often an ephemeral form of land use. Interviews indicate that residents plant gardens primarily for the cultural ecosystem services (e.g. social cohesion, community building) they provide and secondarily for provisioning services (i.e. food production). Uncertainty over land tenure, legacy environmental pollutants, unknowns regarding potential ecosystem disservices, and lack of government support and capital investment are the primary obstacles to scaling up urban agriculture in Detroit and other cities and will need to be addressed. To facilitate its expansion, we propose that urban agriculture be framed as a form of multifunctional green infrastructure. We conducted GIS-based analysis to identify suitable parcels for scaling up agriculture in the study area. To maximize the distribution of ecosystem service benefits, our modeling recommends dispersing rather than clustering gardens in the urban landscape. This strategy would provide more benefits to more people while countering the gentrification effects that may occur when cities expand green space.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4220962356"}}

Concerns about sustainable food supply in a city-region context increasingly spark cities\u2019 authorities to consider their peri-urban area as a source of food. However, such an orientation seldom leads to critically assess planning for peri-urban agriculture. Peri-urban planning is generally based on segregating agriculture and housing, hence risking to overlook agriculture\u2019s potential. This paper unpacks a case of peri-urban planning that intends to integrate farming at a considerable scale in peri-urban development, i.e. the case of Oosterwold in Almere, the Netherlands. Key to Oosterwold is residents\u2019 self-organisation and the 51% allocation of the area to agriculture. The case study departs with a literature review to comprehend peri-urban agriculture in the urban regions of Northwest Europe and comparable regions elsewhere, which can be funnelled into three generic typologies of farming: (1) garden, (2) multi-functional and (3) conventional. Subsequently, the Oosterwold planning practices are analysed which uncovers the influential arrival of newcomers in the planning process. These newcomers are the fresh residents of Oosterwold who start practising urban agriculture in the area. They have contributed to an open-ended, iteratively evolving process of spatial planning, in which the interpretation of peri-urban agriculture appeared malleable. As a consequence, peri-urban agriculture in Oosterwold has predominately developed towards (hobby) garden farming. It is concluded that there is a range of options for integrating agriculture in peri-urban planning, but this implies the inclusion of new practitioners in the planning process which will further stretch existing practices and face new challenges.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4221116811"}}

Abstract The rapid and unplanned urbanisation in Africa has resulted in unprecedented and turbulent effects which include prolonged drought, massive floods, economic losses, increased food insecurity among small-scale and subsistence farmers and increased vulnerability because of rapid climate change. This has been exacerbated by the irrefutable fact that governments in Africa have been ill-prepared and incompetent to effectively deal with the adverse effects of increased urbanisation. In this light, in the overview of this literature study, the researcher set out to explore the theoretical underpinnings and empirical dimensions of the effects of urbanisation on food security in Africa. The study further captures, analyses, and synthesises the literature on best practice applied by governments in Africa in proactively responding to the effects of urbanisation on food security. Furthermore, patterns on the adverse effects of urbanisation relating to food security are unpacked from scholars, and various solutions investigated. This was achieved by rigorously reviewing eleven empirical and relevant journal which were selected from Google Scholar and ResearchGate. The interesting themes that emerged in this study include poor government interventions and decision-making processes, inadequate or absent land-use planning, and high incompetency levels among urban planners. This has led to environmental degradation and unsustainable food security as the result of prime agricultural land being used for infrastructure or housing developments. Solutions suggested for urban food insecurity include public\u2013private partnerships, the alignment of policies with urban agriculture, participatory and strategic land-use planning, and the empowerment of women.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4285011864"}}

Accordingly, the \"green\" elements take the form of: roofing, balconies, terraces, built into part of the building, vertical trusses on the walls, use in the structure of vertical and horizontal communications, in the structure of the apartment on the floor.&#x0D; The second type is an urban, less dense environment that has the potential to expand. This allows the use of additional form-forming elements, such as terracing, or the type of building for which landscaping is more natural. The main task is to unite dense urban development and open spaces for the city, to create a transitional link. Agrarian-type co-housing is best in this case. The location of the agricultural element can be both in the structure of the apartment and the building (terracing, use of neighboring non-residential buildings, ground floor).&#x0D; The third type of urban situation is urban conditions under which the projected structure can use neighboring green areas as its own agricultural cluster.&#x0D; Agricultural buildings and structures in the city can not only improve the percentage of food production, but also improve the psychological state of the population in the compaction of the urban environment.

Food security is becoming an increasingly important issue worldwide, and in this respect, urban agriculture has a substantial role. Nonetheless, pressure for agricultural land conversion and fragmentation is highest in peri-urban areas. In order to respond to these challenges, urban farmers use different adaptation strategies and business models, including product differentiation based on geographical indications (GIs). The paper considers land take (LT) issues in Futog, the settlement of the City of Novi Sad, registered as the GI of Futog cabbage, as an illustrative example which reflects the attitude of land use policy and planning in Serbia towards the specific conditions and requirements that growers of GIs have to meet. The purpose of this study is to identify the role of urban land use planning within LT processes and the implications this has on urban agriculture, accordingly.

Since a significant part of agricultural land registered as a GI in Futog was planned for conversion into construction land, the authors conclude that current forms of land use planning in Serbia are not adequate to ensure the protection of either urban agriculture or GIs. Given that there is a clear correlation between GI products and their place of origin, this study recognized the necessary inclusion of all protected agricultural areas, as well as areas with GIs, into legislation binding for land use planning in Serbia, with limitations in terms of new LT.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4281479500"}}

Rethinking the processes of food production, distribution, sale, consumption and recycling in a sustainable and socially equitable way can contribute to making cities fairer, healthier and more resilient to climate change. Starting from these premises, our contribution explores, in particular, the hypothesis that rethinking the relationship between food and urban space can provide an opportunity to promote socio-spatial regeneration processes of public housing neighbourhoods, through projects and actions that involve their inhabitants. This hypothesis is argued starting from a project experience developed in Borgo San Sergio, a district of Trieste, Italy, which aims to consolidate and enhance practices of cultivation and distribution of food, but also of environmental education. The aim of the project is to create a short supply chain in which social agricultural enterprises are involved. The critical reflection stemming from the case study outlines some possible fields of intervention for an urban planning practice aimed at bringing the food system back to an urban and local scale\u2014downscaling\u2014with social and environmental justice goals consistent with the European Green Deal.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4214625062"}}

Over the coming decades, the level of urbanization in Latin America (LA) is expected to increase nearly 90%, with unwanted consequences such as accentuated socio-economic inequalities, food insecurity, violence, and environmental and health crises. In LA countries, urban agriculture (UA) has been adopted as one of the major strategies to address urban poverty and food insecurity, which have increased for different drivers, such as population growth, economic crises, or forced migration. Nevertheless, experience in these countries has demonstrated that urban agriculture is a complex activity that involves multiple benefits, risks, actors, processes, scales, and interactions. In this review, I analyse urban agriculture in LA countries using the ecosystems services framework as a tool to integrate UA functionalities and the four sustainability dimensions. I considered five issues derived from plant production: (1) ecosystem services, benefits, assets, drivers, and stakeholders in UA; (2) ecosystem services bundles; (3) economic and socio-cultural factors associated with the ecosystem services bundles; (4) research progress in LA countries; (5) issues and possible strategic directions in decision-making of UA in the LA region. Using proxy variables, a total of 17 ecosystem services, six benefits, six assets, and six indirect drivers were recognized. Projections of the 17 variables over the four dimensions of sustainable development showed that the environmental dimension was most studied than the social, economic, and governance dimensions. Most of strengths of UA in LA were related to ecosystem services, benefits, and beneficiaries; main weaknesses were related to the misuse of inputs, and human and environmental health; threats were related to regulation, governance and land tenure issues, and opportunities to several topics related to the four dimensions of sustainability. The concepts, frameworks, and methods used in this study may be effective tools to make scientific information available to managers and decision makers.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4213033626"}}

Abstract Background Household dietary diversity in Rwanda remains low and significantly contributes to the double burden of malnutrition. Rwanda has one of the highest under five stunting rates globally, and malnutrition remains one of the most pressing public health issues; therefore, factors that shape food and nutrition security are of utmost concern. Globally, the variety of foods available in open-air markets has been shown to affect dietary diversity. Furthermore, the consumption of indigenous foods can contribute to a diverse diet and improve nutrition status. At present, there are limited data on foods available for purchase in open-air markets in Africa. Therefore, this study was designed to provide data on food availability in the largest open-air markets of Rwanda\u2019s most populated city, Kigali, and to highlight which foods indigenous to Africa can be purchased. Methods All consumables were inventoried between October and December of 2020 in three open-air markets of Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. Consumables were organized by the site of domestication and the nutritional contents of some African indigenous crops were compared to similar non-indigenous items. Results A variety of raw and processed consumables was available in the open-air markets inventoried; however, only 25.8% of available species are indigenous to Africa. All Rwanda\u2019s staples, including sweet potatoes, plantains, beans, maize, banana, and cassava, are endemic to other continents. Indigenous plant species, which are often drought-resistant and more nutritious, for example, Africa\u2019s pineapple fruits ( Myrianthus holstii ), could not be purchased in Kigali\u2019s open-air markets. Pineapple fruits are richer in iron, vitamin C, protein, and vitamin A than banana, which is the most consumed fruit in Rwanda. Conclusions Given rapid population growth, limited arable land, and erratic climate patterns, policies to conserve and promote indigenous species, especially those already adapted to harsh environmental conditions, should be enacted in Rwanda. The cultivation of native vegetables and fruits in home gardens, and the conservation of edible wild species, can improve dietary diversity and enhance food and nutrition security across the entire country.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4212827812"}}

Increasingly, urban land use planning is getting more complex as limited urban spaces are continuously allocated among diverse land uses. From previous urban food system studies in Ghana, it has become apparent that large portions of urban land parcels are unsustainably converted to urban infrastructure. Hence, the sustainability of the food system is significantly threatened by inefficient spatial and infrastructure planning mechanisms that fail to protect urban agricultural zones. Of critical concern is the fact that agricultural land use allocations on planning schemes are easily converted to residential uses under demand driven expropriations. In that respect, this study was undertaken in the Bolgatanga Township to understand how urban dwellers sustain urban agricultural practices within the city. Using field surveys, key informant interviews and GIS mapping, the study found that, the total sizes of agricultural lands have decreased significantly since 1996 as urban Bolgatanga began sprawling from the inner city through to the urban fringes. In the process, agricultural lands have decreased in terms of both size and contiguity at the household level, compelling farmers to create multiple segregated farmlands within residential neighborhoods in the form of compound farms or fenced urban gardens. Hence, some urban farmers continue to rely on undeveloped residential plots and open public spaces in the inner city for production, but they easily lose these as developments in residential neighborhoods intensifies. From the physical development pattern of the city, we conclude that urbanization in agrarian cities will exacerbate the challenges of food production if relevant policy interventions are unavailable to provide for and protect agricultural lands. The study recommends that, food-inclusive planning schemes should be the basis of future physical plans to guide land uses in the peri-urban and rural zones. This will require both political will and community consensus building on the necessity to preserve urban agricultural space to sustain food supply.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4210995746"}}

The \u201cSystem and sustainable Approach to virTuous interaction of Urban and Rural LaNdscapes\u201d (SATURN) project is exploring how resilience at a city scale might be achieved and how the issues of landscape fragmentation, governance and land management can be addressed resulting in a sustainable future. The EIT Climate-KIC SATURN project is based on a collaboration between three cities of very different scales and contexts, those of Gothenburg in western Sweden, Trento in northern Italy, and Birmingham in the United Kingdom. This paper focuses on the ways in which urban farming can become an important tool to mitigate or adapt to climate change in urban environments by exploring how the three major cities of SATURN deal with these concepts. Using the experience gained throughout the SATURN project as well as the strong communication developed within the consortium, the paper introduces the reasons why urban farming is not just an agricultural activity, but it relates to climate awareness, health and an element of community. With the examples of different urban farming models, this research presents the fully entrepreneurial model of Gothenburg, where a business model fosters sustainable and successful small-scale farming through municipal management of small allotments with associated basic infrastructure leased out to entrepreneurs. Public underutilized land is matched with farmers in order for them to scale up their businesses and provide sustainable food, by limiting the shipping distance of the produce. In the Trento case, bottom-up and more institutional processes have been combined to foster short local supply chains through the Nutrire Trento networking process which could benefit from the introduction of a land lease scheme named \u201cbanca della terra\u201d (to support agricultural land recovery). The case of Birmingham presents a different model where farming in an urban environment is mostly seen as a support to communities, mental health and awareness, rather than an entrepreneurial activity. The innovation in this paper comes in the form of different European models related to urban agriculture and best practices, demonstrating how abandoned and underutilised public and private land can be regenerated and become an active part of the urban realm. Insights on the ways in which the three different models operate, as well as results on how farming in an urban environment can enhance resilient cities are discussed in this paper.

This article uses a case study of urban agriculture in Oporto City, as a guiding principle to recover and re-establish the continuous productive urban landscape. This paper expands on the currently existing urban planning policies. It establishes new ones, which strive for the protection and the insertion of the continuous productive urban landscape in urban design while regarding the urban/agricultural dichotomy and ensuring the occurrence of its processes, flows, and systems. This article defines urban agriculture as a method for the reliable integration of urban agriculture into urban space planning. The case draws on research in Oporto, focusing on the recovering of the ancient rural ring. This idea is based on recent and historical arguments to support the advantages of retrieving and introducing urban agriculture into open urban space.

Abstract There is an urgent need for agriculture in general, and for viticulture in particular, to reduce their impacts on the environment. Doing so requires an approach that supports transitioning to more environmentally friendly practices. Involving farmers and agricultural advisors is key to lifting technical, economic, and social barriers to this transition. Participatory methods can help to consider specific contexts and concerns, but few suitable tools are available. We developed a methodological framework to address both environmental and economic dimensions at the field and farm scales in three participatory ecodesign workshops with winegrowers. We applied our framework to the ecodesign of pathways of technical operations in the Middle Loire Valley, France. The first two workshops focused on the field scale, and group interactions were facilitated using a serious game and a \u201clive\u201d assessment of the environmental performance of the ecodesigned system. The third workshop focused on implementation at farm level. The aggregated environmental impact of the ecodesigned farm decreased by 4%, while the economic performance of its four pathways of technical operations improved. We showed that combining environmental and economic assessment tools, suitable for use in participatory workshops, addresses most mechanisms for and barriers to changing practices at the farm scale. The typology of activities at the farm scale allows farm characteristics and the diversity of production systems to be represented in the ecodesign without over-complicating the process. The use of farm maps takes advantage of the collective expertise of the group and increases participant involvement. This process highlighted the need to continue to extend the scope and criteria of ecodesign to decrease environmental impacts even more. Here, we show for the first time the need to quantify the influence of a farm\u2019s environmental practices on its economic performance to reduce the perception of risk and facilitate adoption of these practices.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4210902739"}}

Abstract As urban areas and land-use constraints grow, there is increasing interest in utilizing urban spaces for food production. Several studies have uncovered significant potential for urban growing to supplement production of fruit and vegetables, focusing on one or two cities as case studies, whilst others have assessed the global scale potential. Here, we provide a national-scale analysis of the horticultural production potential of urban green spaces, which is a relevant scale for agri-food and urban development policy making using Great Britain (GB) as a case study. Urban green spaces available for horticultural production across GB are identified and potential yields quantified based on three production options. The distribution of urban green spaces within 26 urban towns and cities across GB are then examined to understand the productive potential compared to their total extent and populations. Urban green spaces in GB, at their upper limit, have the capacity to support production that is 8\u00d7 greater than current domestic production of fruit and vegetables. This amounts to 38% of current domestic production and imports combined, or &gt;400% if exotic fruits and vegetables less suited to GB growing conditions are excluded. Most urban green spaces nationally are found to fall within a small number of categories, with private residential gardens and amenity spaces making up the majority of space. By examining towns and cities across GB in further detail, we find that the area of green space does not vary greatly between urban conurbations of different sizes, and all are found to have substantial potential to meet the dietary needs of the local urban population. This study highlights that national policies can be suitably developed to support urban agriculture and that making use of urban green spaces for food production could help to enhance the resilience of the national-scale food system to shocks in import pathways, or disruptions to domestic production and distribution.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4205808911"}}

The city of Addis Ababa is in the rapid urbanization era which leaves the city with less farm land, less green cover, unemployment, increase in market price of food and increasing greenhouse effect. Since, Food supply and production are still from the rural parts. And urban farming is showing potentials to solve these problems. There are many practices and advancements that take the idea of urban farming beyond possibility and make it wholly sustainable in the city. This research on the contribution of architectural design concepts for sustainable urban farming in selected urban farms from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Has a main objective of assessing and evaluating urban farms on the selected criteria of sustainability, then identify the problem areas and prospects to forward architectural solutions. To achieve this goal six criterions were devised, all based on the three pillars of sustainability (ecological, social, and economical), with the help of reference materials covered in the literature review. The case study method was helpful to gather, analyze and evaluate input data. In this research it was evident that most of the urban farm in Addis Ababa didn\u2019t fully achieve the sustainability criteria. For an urban farm to be wholly sustainable a variety of systems must be in place. The systems must range from different growing methods, to a multifunctionality of systems involving and educating the public, and they must utilize different aspects of the site. It is also equally important that the systems are interdependent and work toward functioning as a larger system.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4299728474"}}

With the increase of the FFV exports, the actors in the coastal regions in Peru, especially those in the capital city of Lima, began to form a cluster. The nuclei of the cluster were industry associations of producers and exporters organized around export crops. The joint actions of these associations were critical to the development of the industry. With these joint actions, agribusiness companies were able to achieve what would not have been possible individually. The achievements include joint purchase of inputs, transfer of knowledge regarding new technologies through seminars and training, joint marketing, and building infrastructure for the industry. These joint actions mobilized resources in the private sector to build public goods such as a phytosanitary capacity for exports.

Urbanization and agricultural land use are two of the main drivers of global changes with effects on ecosystem functions and human wellbeing. Green infrastructure is a new and promising approach in spatial planning contributing to sustainable urban development, but rarely considers spatial and functional potentials of utilizable agricultural land as an integral part. This doctoral thesis addresses this gap and investigates how peri-urban farmland can promote green infrastructure and sustainable urban development. The results contribute to the conceptual understanding of urban green infrastructures as a strategic spatial planning approach that incorporates inner-urban utilizable agricultural land and the agriculturally dominated landscape at the outer urban fringe. Four strategies are introduced for spatial planning with the contribution to a strategically planned multifunctional network. Finally, this thesis sheds light on the opportunities that arise from the integration of peri-urban farmland in the green infrastructure concept to support transformation towards a more sustainable urban development. This work concludes that the linkage of peri-urban farmland with the green infrastructure concept is a promising action field for the development of new pathways for urban transformation towards sustainable urban development.

What can be more exciting and thrilling than the story of Casablanca-the place where the image of modern and iconic Morocco has been drawn, with a lot of care and vigour, as a country ready in all aspects to step into a promising millennium? However, Casablanca\u2019s unprecedented rapid urban and demographic growth since the beginning of the twentieth century, coupled with a chronic lack of integrative urban strategies, have led to an urban and ecological crisis in the city. Casablanca is preparing for its 5.1 million inhabitants while still unable to solve its current problems; if Casablanca is the beating heart of the Moroccan economy, it is also the most polluted of its cities, the most congested, the densest \u2026 in short, it is as problematic as unique in the Moroccan urban context. After a century of economic, urban, and industrial development, Casablanca now faces tremendous challenges that merge with the fast process of mega-urbanisation: housing crisis, social segregation, high unemployment rates, soaring demographic growth, permanent congestion, air and water pollution, a virtual absence of open and green spaces. When looking at these major challenges as well as the increasing risks of climate change that threaten the whole region, it becomes less and less evident that the economic factors would continue to be the only determinants of the city\u2019s spatial and urban configuration, meaning that other ecological and socio-demographic variables have to become equally important in the process of Casablanca\u2019s urban development. Through an extensive investigation of the development trends of growing megacities and the challenges they face, particularly in developing countries, the current work takes Casablanca as a case study, and proposes approaches, methods, and tools to integrate a green and productive infrastructure based on urban agriculture as a multifunctional component of urban planning. In this regard, this research tries to analyse and reposition urban agriculture in the discourse on sustainable urban development and the impacts of climate change, by proposing a new multifunctional model of urban management and redefining the role of green open spaces in the context of Casablanca. The proposed design highlights the issue of inner-city brownfields and vacant spaces in Casablanca, and how they can be regenerated by hosting new and multifunctional facilities and uses. Through the redevelopment of a 25-ha inner-city railway brownfield into a productive urban park, the project proposes comprehensive solutions and ideas based on the concept of multifunctional urban agriculture, and integrates various economic, ecological, social, and technical aspects aiming at the establishment of a complex urban ecosystem, and a vertical and multifunctional intervention linking various urban sectors in the city.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3174216424"}}

Linking social and cultural components with environmental and economic dimensions becomes the goal of all the disciplines that aim to shape more sustainable urban environments. Solutions require interdisciplinary approaches and the use of a complex array of tools. One of these tools is the implementation of community gardening, which provides a wide range of advantages for creating more inclusive spaces and integrated communities. Since food is strongly related to the values and identities of any cultural group, it can be used as a medium to promote social inclusion in the context of urban multicultural societies. By bringing people together into specific urban sites, food production can be integrated in multifunctional spaces while addressing social, economic and ecological goals. The goal of this research is to assess different approaches to urban agriculture by analysing three existing community gardens located in Newtown, a suburb of Wellington, New Zealand. As a context for developing research, Newtown offers different approaches to urban farming and is really valuable for observing current trends of socialization in diverse and multicultural societies. All three spaces are located on public land owned by Wellington City Council and confined to a small, complex and progressively denser urban area. The developed analysis was focused on social, cultural and physical dimensions, combining community engagement with different techniques of spatial assessment. At the same time, a detailed investigation of each community garden was conducted with comparative analysis methodologies. This multidirectional setting of the analysis was established for extracting from the case studies both specific and typological knowledge. Each site was analysed and categorised under three broad themes: people, space and food. The analysis revealed that all three case studies had really different spatial settings, different approaches to food production and varying profiles of supportive communities. The main differences identified were demographics, values, objectives, internal organization, appropriation and perception of the space. The community gardens were approached as case studies for developing design research. Following participatory design processes with the different communities, the knowledge gained from the analysis was used for proposing changes in the physical environment. The end goal of the design research was to improve the capacity of the spaces to facilitate social inclusiveness. In order to generate tangible changes, a range of small, strategic and feasible spatial interventions were explored. The smallness of the proposed interventions facilitate implementation by reducing time frames, technical resources, funding needs and legal processes, working within the community\u00b4s own realm. These small interventions are expected to be implemented over time as part of an ongoing collaboration between the different communities, the university and the local council.

This paper aims to examine the views of urban poor children on the sustainability of urban gardening in mid-tier cities. The focus is on children engaged in urban micro-gardening in an informal settlement in San Jose del Monte (SJDM) City, Philippines. Informal settlements in SJDM comprise households under poverty that use vacant lands for micro-gardening as part of their general urban survival. Through remote qualitative interviews with 9\u201312 years old children (n = 25), this article analyzes children\u2019s opinions on the ecological benefits of their micro-gardens and the potentials they see in urban farming. Responses show contrasting sentiments. On the one hand, children perceive micro-gardens as helpful to the city\u2019s ecological sustainability and well-being. They consider urban gardens as a major household survival strategy against food insecurity. But on the other hand, these children have little hopes that urban policymakers will notice their contributions towards the city\u2019s sustainability. They do not expect significant improvement occurring in their micro-gardens and they fear to lose their micro-gardens due to threats of eviction. Such views of the children put into question the city\u2019s green governance and urban garden\u2019s capacity to address equity issues on sustainable food security in cities. This paper proposes that mid-tier cities have the potential to accommodate the vision of sustainable development through urban farming designs.

We reviewed 92 empirical articles, reporting on 83 cities, by applying a framework focused on interactions between urban growth, agricultural production factors, and urban food markets. Results show that the most reported challenges facing UPA are agricultural land conversion and peripheralization. Yet, a number of studies indicate spatial expansion and intensification of UPA due to increasing and changing food demand. Urban growth-related dynamics in the availability of water, organic fertilizer, and labour can further foster or constrain UPA. Consequently, farmers respond and adapt to urban growth in multiple ways. These findings indicate a complex, multi-dimensional challenge for planners and policy makers seeking to manage UPA in rapidly urbanizing landscapes. Yet, our meta-analysis shows that few studies holistically address spatiotemporal dynamics, intra-urban variations, and complex multi-dimensional interlinkages of UPA under urban growth. To overcome these limitations and chart a new framework for future research, we reconceptualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of UPA under urban growth as a wheel of urban growth-related UPA dynamics. To apply this framework, we call for further mixed-methods research linking multi-temporal, remotely sensed data to longitudinal qualitative and quantitative fieldwork data, in order to better understand and critically assess the multifaceted and dynamic socio-spatial changes of UPA in cities across the Global South.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3183697132"}}

At the same time, from a planning perspective, urban agriculture also provides a valuable resource for urban regeneration. However, depending on prevalent farming practices urban agriculture may also have social and environmental externalities. While several of these aspects have been extensively tackled in the literature, others, in particular governance and planning aspects, are still unaddressed. Moreover, a comprehensive outline for the evaluation of urban agriculture performance from an urban sustainability perspective is still lacking.

Abstract To protect the beauty and diversity of Quirino from the impacts of natural and human-made disasters, the call for sustainable and regenerative developments strengthens. With the introduction of permaculture in the province, it can serve as a framework for these developments. As such, the study seeks to showcase the potentials of permaculture by integrating its principles in the landscape design of Faraon Integrated Farm, as it aims to be a sustainable and regenerative agricultural eco-park. To achieve its goal, a series of literature studies, analyses, and conceptualization was conducted to identify the areas where permaculture can be incorporated. As a result, a permaculture-based landscape design of a sustainable and regenerative agricultural eco-park with a closed-loop system is developed. The eco-park was divided into six (6) permaculture zones, arranged according to the amount of attention it needs, consisting of areas chosen and designed based on the twelve (12) permaculture principles. To improve its sustainability and regenerative capacity, various technologies, practices, and techniques were also incorporated into the design, such as intercropping, use of natural farming inputs, vermicomposting, rainwater harvester &amp; catchment, and utilization of renewable sources of energy. By imitating the Earth\u2019s natural processes and relationships, permaculture can create sustainable and regenerative developments that could preserve and enhance the natural environment.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3208847112"}}

The research was developed in two phases, namely, a workshop and a survey of stakeholders involved in RUA from the four cities. Education, environmental, research, technological innovation, food production, and social factors play an important role in implementing RUA. Productive spaces, cultural values, social cohesion, social rural-urban links, and the high cost of urban land are highlighted as factors that \u201cpromote\u201d RUA. In contrast, the cost of water and pollution are major contextual factors that constrain RUA. Policies related to food trade and urban planning are those that most limit RUA development. Major architectural and technical barriers related to the limits on building heights, historical buildings, a lack of specific building codes, building design and roof accessibility were identified. The high cost of infrastructure and policies that prohibit RUA product sales emerged as economic constraints. Major differences among the cities studied included the perceived effect of urban policies on RUA diffusion as well as the perceived relevance of economic and pollution factors. This study revealed that extensive dissemination and the development of appropriate information about RUA are needed. The creation of new regulations, as well as modifications to urban and building codes to support RUA, is also envisaged. This approach will consider a more flexible land-use policy that allows agriculture to take place in cities as well as marketing frameworks for RUA products.

The process makes it clear that despite the fact that urban agriculture is considered in planning documents of both cities, the scale of the activity and the approach towards it differ markedly. In Singapore, the authorities support mainly the high-technology and land-efficient solutions, with other, low-profit forms of agricultural activity being pushed out from the urban space. In turn, in Kigali, where the scale of agricultural activity is incomparably greater, the inhabitants enjoy a certain freedom to make use of unused land in cultivation, which increases their food security and enhances their ability to cope with external stresses.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3199964897"}}

The ecosystem services of urban green spaces and infrastructures and the productivity of specific urban agricultural technologies have been discussed in literature. However, the understanding of input and output (I/O) streams of different nature-based solutions (NBS) is not yet sufficient to identify the challenges and opportunities they offer for strengthening circularity in UA. We propose a series of agriculture NBS, which, implemented in cities, would address circularity challenges in different urban spaces. To identify the challenges, gaps, and opportunities related to the enhancement of resources management of agriculture NBS, we evaluated NBS units, interventions, and supporting units, and analyzed I/O streams as links of urban circularity.

In recent years, urban gardens have received increased interest from urban citizens as well as urban planners as a tool to promote sustainable urban development. The increased demand by citizens and planners for different forms of garden areas, however, is at odds with a densifying city and the loss of green spaces. Urban planners are therefore faced with the challenge of rethinking the functions and objectives of city gardens and, in turn, adapting the governance mechanisms with regard to sustainable urban development. The aim of this paper is to develop a new framework to analyse governance mechanisms, expressed as policy approaches to urban food garden development, which can serve as an analytical tool to enable comparison of cities and to analyse their efforts to achieve urban sustainability. The framework is based on case study analysis of public policies towards urban food gardening in the Swiss cities Berne, Lausanne and Zurich. We identified three core dimensions to characterise policy approaches in cities for the further development of city gardening: frames, level of institutionalisation, and policy-society relationship. Frames refer to the perception of gardening which is expressed by the objectives set by the city policy and the contributions gardening should fulfil in urban development. Level of institutionalisation provides information on the extent to which garden support is anchored in urban policy. Policy-society relationship refers to the type of leadership by city politics and the possibility for non-political actors to participate.

They tend to increasingly raise doubts and concerns among consumers and undermine their trust in agriculture and food products. The level of trust in the product considerably depends on available information on production methods and supply chains. The collection and exchange of such information are facilitated by digital technologies in the economy, including agriculture. The information obtained allows for better and faster communication between various stakeholder groups, thus promoting trust among them. The purpose of this study is to indicate the possibilities of improving trust levels in agriculture by the implementation and use of digital technologies in agriculture and food chains. Research has revealed that digital technologies can bring a number of benefits, including the advantage of building trust in agriculture. At the same time, they generate certain concerns on privacy and unfair distribution of benefits among different stakeholder groups, resulting from the use of production and supply chain data.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3192806941"}}

Introduction: To ensure greenery in this busy city, the trend of growing vegetables on green roofs has gained momentum as a way of promoting agricultural sustainability in Dhaka City. However, due to the pandemic havoc caused by COVID-19 outbreak, people now a days have realized the extensive need for such green practice in urban areas to ensure their own food security. Objections: The objectives of this study were to explore the necessity of small-scale gardening or rooftop gardening (RTG), how it helped people by providing their food demands during this pandemic situation. By following the purposive random sampling technique, a total of 100 respondents (who were already practicing RTG) took part into the survey from two city corporation areas named Mirpur, Uttara (Dhaka North City Corporation) and Dhanmondi, Malibagh (Dhaka South City Corporation) areas of Dhaka city. Results and Discussion: Results of the study showed that more than 60% of the respondents got direct support from their roof top gardening during this COVID-19 situation. Almost 41% of the respondents claimed that this food supply was enough for them to sufficiently meet their need for vegetables for a single day. Most importantly, more than 90% of the respondents shared that, if provided with proper training and necessary supports, roof top gardening can be the best solution to ensure food security in post pandemic world.

This paper reports on two surveys mapping the distribution of species of edible plants growing in publicly accessible interstitial spaces (e.g. central reservations and pavements) in subtropical, central CDMX. It also reports on an initial assessment of the feasibility of using such spaces for foraging. Rather than improving everyday food supplies, the maintenance of these spaces as areas for emergency foraging would ideally increase urban resilience in the face of extreme food supply shocks. The surveys used a direct species identification approach whilst walking \u223c20 km of streets and identified thirty-six species of edible plants including not only fruits and herbs, but also vegetables. The results permitted the satisfactory assessment of three out of five feasibility conditions: (i) suitable growing conditions, (ii) provisioning capability and (iii) the existence of multiple plant dispersal pathways (including both natural processes and deliberate planting, as well as, more speculatively, unintentional human-mediated dispersal).

Second, the disregard of the intensified negative environmental (and related social) externalities caused by distant agricultural production, as well as lacking consideration of nutrient re-cycling potentials in cities (e.g. from wastewater) to replace emission intensive mineral fertilizer use.

In this article, we propose the concept of developing a modular cell for the construction of a vertical truss, which is attached to the bulk of residential buildings. The main idea is to introduce a modular cell in the Kazakhstan market for the development of urban farming. Vertical farms made up of modular cells are designed for growing organic agricultural products in urban environments. It is proposed to place vertical trusses in the blind, functionally undeveloped ends of residential buildings.The relevance of the production of organic agricultural products is outlined in the strategic development plan of the country, as one of the important areas responsible for the growth of the well-being of the people and the health of the younger generation. One of the well-known methods of organizing organic agriculture in urban settings is the use of vertical farms. Vertical trusses are widely used in the form of separate equipment-racks located inside the room. There are design proposals for vertical trusses in the form of separate independent buildings. The vertical truss proposed in this study consists of modular cells, which allows you to apply different compositional solutions. This cell has the ability to be arranged in different ways and adapt to any area. Vertical trusses will be built into the blind ends of residential buildings. After all, it is known that the area under the blind ends of 5-9-storey residential buildings do not find their high-quality use and very often create unfavorable, to some extent criminally dangerous sections of the city. According to the latest statistics of criminology, most of the crimes committed in the city occur in areas with blind ends of residential buildings. The height and total area of the vertical trusses will depend on the height of the residential buildings and on the overall aesthetic design of the spatial organization of the environment. The competitive advantage of the developed modular cell is the versatility of its application, mobility, as well as the interdisciplinary basis of the combined areas-architecture, design, agriculture, healthcare, construction, etc.The expected result is the qualitative development of urban farming, which can become a new market niche for the production of organic products. Urban farming can become new jobs for the residents of the houses in which vertical farms are built.

Abstract Food access, stability and utilisation are key dimensions of food security at an urban scale. When the majority resided in rural areas, and lived predominantly agrarian lifestyles, it made sense for the state to govern food security through national agricultural ministries, focusing predominantly on the availability dimension of food security. With the transition to a majority urban world, coupled with the food security challenges currently experienced in urban areas, specifically in Africa, these historical policy and governance structures are increasingly inadequate in responding to essential food and nutrition needs. Problematically, urban areas, and specifically urban managers, cite unfunded mandates, and absent authority, as the reasons for not engaging food and nutrition governance responses. This paper argues that this is a false position. Drawing on recent data from household food security and poverty surveys, the paper calls for new and expanded planning and design approaches at the urban scale. The paper argues that spatial planning and urban design principles and actions provide an immediate and effective means through which to engage urban food system questions. Importantly these actions are essential to the transition from the current piecemeal project responses to urban food system inadequacies. Food sensitive planning and urban design is offered as a specific approach that could assist in programming food system\u2013related challenges at the urban scale, responding to conceptual, analytical, organisational and design related dimensions of planning, and in so doing offering a longer term, systematic response to urban food insecurity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3158143342"}}

However, comprehensive assessments of its potential are still lacking. Here, we use a systematic review of the literature on UA in the global North to identify factors that determine its success in providing resilience benefits, explore challenges that can limit this, and develop a conceptual model to highlight the ways in which it could be enhanced through research, policy, and practice. We define the success of UA in increasing city resilience as determined by five factors, which in turn depend on the amount of institutional and public support for UA, the presence of a sufficient knowledge base, communication and collaboration among different actors, and resourcefulness in finding alternative ways to use space and other resources efficiently.

Attention to urban agriculture has increased rapidly during the last couple of decades. Enthusiasm for UA is growing on an international and domestic level, also with the scholar community. Still, there are policy makers that struggle to implement UA with city planning. Over time, various forms of agriculture production in the city have evolved, divided into three main categories: urban agriculture, peri-urban agriculture, and urban farms. In addition to its multiple impacts (economic and ecological), UA has a significant holistic approach. It appears differently depending on the context. Some of the social effects of urban agriculture can be: fostering activism, gender equality, social cohesion and social inclusion, education, and preservation of cultural heritage.

Urban food security is a growing concern in many cities across the world due to the increasing global challenge to feed the world. This concern assumes increased prominence in the fast-growing cities of the Global South where most of the new urbanisation is taking place. As many cities in the Global North adopt a raft of measures to ensure their cities are food secure, little is happening in cities of the Global South. The few efforts taking place do not always take a holistic approach to urban food security. In many cities, there is a conflation of urban food security with urban agriculture. Officials in the public and non-governmental organisation sectors take urban agriculture to be the most important, if not the only strategy to combat hunger in cities. This chapter challenges the notion of urban agriculture as a panacea to urban food security on its own. Through examining literature on what strategies cities are adopting to address food security and through interviews with key informants, the chapter established that approaches to food security are narrow-minded and misplaced.

To achieve this, we contend that it will be of ecological, economic, and social advantage for cities, towns, and countryside if existing green infrastructure (GI) concepts embraced the food subject. Green infrastructure, if food productive, can enhance nature\u2010based solutions and be the spatial enabler of agroecological processes.

Increasingly there are many studies focusing on urban food systems as a whole and this systematic approach has been fruitful. Some components of the urban food system have also been examined individually. Some of the most frequently studied components of food systems are food production, reduction of food waste, the contribution of urban agriculture, nutrition, food security issues and the sustainability of urban food systems. However, comparatively less studies have sought to understand urban food markets as a crucial component of urban food systems especially in relation to resilience. Governments have become increasingly aware of the need for resilience planning so that they are better prepared for natural disasters and other destabilising shocks as a move towards fulfilling some of the objectives of the New Urban Agenda (NUA). This resilience planning is also crucial where urban food markets are concerned. This chapter is the output of a desktop study that contributes to an understanding of the relation between urban food markets and the resilience factor in Zimbabwe. Whilst urban food systems as a whole are critical in resilience planning, it is also of paramount importance to have a food market perspective particularly in the new era where food supplies are threatened by the coronavirus pandemic. Resilient urban food markets can withstand various shocks and stresses ranging from social upheavals to natural disasters and economic shocks and as a result contribute to food security. The chapter examines Zimbabwe\u2019s urban food markets and their resilience mostly in terms of economic shocks and reviews literature by various proponents. It proceeds to interrogate the different types of markets that exist in Zimbabwean cities, how each typology operates and the implications on resilience and on urban food security.

Small towns in sub-Saharan African countries are usually faced with immense challenges, which are called stresses and/or shocks in the urban resilience literature. Diagnosing stresses or slow burns and developing local resilience against them is a crucial task that urban planners and practitioners usually neglect. This paper presents a robust methodology that demystifies the ambiguity around the concept of resilience, a concept usually understood as general and normative, through a bottom-up approach that makes it measurable. This is achieved by diagnosing the most pressing societal problem mainly through a household consumption survey\u2014with people\u2019s needs being at the heart of the diagnosis\u2014and investigating its relationship with the spatial configuration of the case town, Amdework, a small town in northern Ethiopia. The research reveals that food, a marginalised issue in the urban agenda, is the most stressed consumption in the town, against which local resilience has to be developed. This relegation of the food agenda is mainly the result of unfavourable policies and practices manifesting itself in the form of an absence of officially designated space for food production and unfavourable land-use changes. Furthermore, the paper investigates other bottom-up-informal initiatives aimed at improving specified resilience against the food stress.

Urban food security and food systems are receiving growing attention at global level both North and South. Although, the issue of food and city planning management is insufficiently covered and is limited in existing literature, there exists very few comprehensive planning books that properly consider food planning and the integration of food systems, some cities and regions have made huge progress over recent years. However, their practices have not been made visible to a wide audience and reflections on their limitations and successes deserve greater attention. The New Urban Agenda (NUA) places specific additional responsibilities for cities to include food in city management. Therefore, this chapter aims to improve the understanding of food and city planning management in Zimbabwe.

Is the management structure and skills set in urban councils appropriate and sustainable? What are the management experiences that can be shared from Zimbabwean cities? The findings indicate that over the years there has been a growing recognition of the persistence of food insecurity in urban areas mostly in developing countries, because food production was for a long time considered a rural issue, thus urban agriculture has emerged as a lucrative livelihood strategy used to curb food insecurity in urban areas.

Although urban farmland has various ecological and social benefits, it is still unstable to position it as part of the green infrastructure of a modern city; for spatial, ecological and social-functional dimensions. First, it is unclear whether the amount and location of urban farmland is adequate to call it the \u201cinfrastructure\u201d of the city. Secondly, pesticides and fertilizers are used on farmland, which causes environmental pollution. Third, since farmland is privately owned land and considered to be a site of economic production, it often lacks the features of public space.

Within the scholarly debate, Urban Agriculture (UA) has been widely acknowledged to provide diverse environmental and socio-cultural ecosystem services (ESs) for cities. However, the question of whether these potential benefits are also recognized as such by the involved societal groups on the ground has not yet been investigated. This paper aims at (1) assessing the perceived ESs of UA, comparing the views of different societal groups in the city of Bologna, Italy (namely: UA project leaders, stakeholders and the general public) and (2) to identify differences in the evaluation of specific UA types (indoor farming, high-tech greenhouses, peri-urban farms, community-supported agriculture, community rooftop garden and urban co-op). In total, 406 individuals evaluated 25 ESs via a standardized Likert-scale survey. The study unveiled similarities and divergences of perceptions among the different societal groups. The statistical analysis indicated that the general public and UA stakeholders agree on the high relevance of socio-cultural ESs, while provisioning ESs was considered as less significant. UA types focusing on social innovation were expected to provide higher socio-cultural ESs whereas peri-urban activities were more closely linked to habitat ESs. We assume that involvement and knowledge of UA are determining factors for valuing the provision of ESs through UA, which needs to be considered for ES valuation, particularly in a policymaking context.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3111797577"}}

Allotment gardening systems are widely used to provide urban residents with small-scale community agricultural plots. Originating in local food production needs, allotments provide multiple additional benefits and contribute to urban resilience. Despite overwhelming evidence of the diversity of benefits that they offer, allotments are under threat, though the extent of the decline in provision remains largely unknown. London, U.K. serves as a model in which to quantify contemporary provision of, and demand for, allotments in a growing city. This study provides concrete evidence to inform future policy and planning. The data come from multiple sources: previous publications provide baselines, while local authorities and management groups provided current details of allotment sites and their waiting lists; allotments were additionally mapped using GIS to determine area of provision. Allotment sites are being lost in London at an increasing rate, approximately triple that of a decade ago, and the compensatory measure of decreasing individual plot sizes within a site is widely employed to buffer demand. This decline can be largely attributed to increasing land value and pressures coupled with restrictive local authority finances. This decline in provision has coincided with an increase in popularity. We found that the demand for allotments has increased four-fold since 2006. When considering the 55 % of sites for which we obtained sufficient data, provision would need to increase by 77 % in order to address the current length of waiting lists.

In academia as well as in the global agenda policy discourse, there is a greater recognition for the need to understand dimensions that contribute to the quality of life in cities beyond economic and growth indicators.Part of this search for a more comprehensive perspective calls for a new understanding of the role of public space. In the realm of urban studies, there is, on the one hand, a tradition of more spatial-centred research of analysing morphological characteristics of public space. On the other hand, there is an increasing number of studies that focus on the usability and the production of space and are thereby more interested in agency. By combing both perspectives, the aim is to identify key characteristics that could ultimately influence planning and policy-making for improving quality of life through useable public space.The paper seeks to narrow this reflection by unravelling the role of urban agriculture as one agency to activate public space and public life in the context of the Global South. In order to do so, it will discuss different examples in Cape Town, South Africa. Local government and various civil society organisations are concerned about the continuous social polarisation and fragmentation in the city.

Urban green spaces have been researched extensively for their contribution towards livable, sustainable and resilient cities. Studies illustrate increasing awareness of the multi-functional roles such spaces can fulfill in addressing urbanization pressures and associated impacts such as increasing stress on global food systems, notably by accommodating practices of urban agriculture (UA). This paper investigates the potential for UA in South Africa as a citizen-led urban greening strategy, considering potential and limitations for the increased application of UA in spatial planning. The paper provides a review of core concepts and illustrates potential and certain limitations via UA cases studies in two leading South African provinces and a review of the national policy and legislative framework pertaining to UA. Findings highlight particular issues for consideration to augment the implementation of UA in South Africa, including opportunities to draw on existing citizen-led initiatives and increasing awareness of UA among communities, authorities, non-governmental organizations and the private sector; the potential to utilize skilled and knowledgeable rural migrants; and possibilities to capitalize on a growing market for UA related opportunities to stimulate economic growth and employment creation whilst addressing food security concerns. Limitations highlighted in the paper, include many current UA initiatives not being self-sustaining and fully citizen-driven, requiring constant support and resources from multiple stakeholders; a cultural stigma attached to UA activities, hampering more uptake, especially among the youth; limited national support as no dedicated national policy on UA exists to direct the spatial planning community; and lastly, that South African spatial planners exhibit limited knowledge of UA and green infrastructure in general. The paper concludes with broad recommendations for the international planning community to advance the implementation of UA as a citizen-led urban greening strategy, drawing on the South African experience.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3085448306"}}

Abstract. Urban farming is recently acknowledged as a strategy with various services in improving cities resilience but facing cons such as land competition and rapid urbanization. The study attempts to inventory available areas for urban farming implementation and estimate the total values with case study in Malang city, Indonesia. The study divided urban farming into five forms i.e. nursery, allotment, residential, institutional and rooftop farming based on its characteristics. Land inventory has been done by estimating existing and potential areas. Existing area was manually delineated by Field Area Measure App through field visit and visualized by ArcGIS. Potential area was identified through geospatial assessment considering land use and land cover map provided by the Government of Indonesia and parcel zoning based on Guideline of Urban Farming development and literatures. The study employed Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) and Market Price Method to estimate total values of urban farming. Currently there is 1.38 ha of urban farming which is equal to 0.01 % of city\u2019s area distributed in 21 plots and 211.46 ha potential area or equal to 1.92 % of city\u2019s area.

This transformation emphasizes other socio-spatial dynamics connected to touristification in which central areas take on the function of a stage and display case for short-lived urban experiences aimed at visitors to the detriment of residents. After a theoretical discussion on the concept of foodification, the article takes a closer look at the different forms in which the process is apparent in the historic centre of Florence.

There is a renewed interest in urban gardening in the past decade stimulated by the increased awareness of benefits that it brings to the city, local communities, and individuals. Previous studies have shown different perspectives on urban food growing in the context of developed and developing countries, but less is known about the countries in transition in Southeast Europe. Specifically, no published research has coped with the perspectives of the possible future users of allotment and community gardens. This paper fills the gap to a certain extent by providing first insights into the demand for collective urban gardens in the city of Belgrade. There are no institutional tools at present to support the development of such gardens, although there has been an almost century-long process of advocating collective urban gardening among the experts in city planning. By looking into the possible future needs and motivations of the potential gardeners, specifically, those who are not involved in allotment or community gardening, this study also aims to contribute to the efforts made in the past. The survey was conducted among 300 randomly selected respondents in three municipalities in Belgrade. Data were analysed using factor analytic\u2014multiple regression approach to establish correlations between personal characteristics of potential gardeners and their motivations for gardening. Results indicated a potentially high demand for collective urban gardens, with individual plots slightly preferred to shared gardens. Commonly mentioned motivations are access to healthy and fresh food followed by recreation and light physical activity. People with previous experience in agriculture or gardening are more willing to get involved. Older respondents seem to be more motivated by \u201esubjective well-being\u201c, specifically in terms of relaxation and pleasure from gardening.

From the second half of 20th century topicality and practices of urban agriculture are growing widely not only in social initiatives but also in scientific research (the number of articles in scientific databases has increased 18-30 times since 2000). Growing interest has identified various variations and tendencies in the interpretation of the concept of urban agriculture, having regard to the current United Nations definition that is broad, but in research works and case studies researchers adapt the definitions to the local characteristics and aim of the study, thus creating a number of risks in the interpretation of the concept, including limited possibilities for quantitative comparisons between studies. The aim of the article is to identify the historical development stages of the concept of urban agriculture and to determine the main research tendencies in its application. To achieve this aim, the method of monographic and descriptive analysis was used for theoretical discussion, analysis, synthesis and deduction - for information gathering, logical systematization and classification. As a result of the study, it was identified that the concept of urban agriculture is developed in three different stages - originally associated with the technical solutions of urban planning for providing food for city dwellers, it is currently developing in tendencies of different directions: analysis of agriculture\u2019s role in urban areas (including mitigating climate change risks), classification of types of urban agriculture, opportunities for adapting innovations and technological solutions to urban agriculture, the place and context of urban agriculture for sustainable development in the circumstances of urbanization.

Propelled by rapid urbanization, city administrations in low- and middle-income countries face a raft of challenges to secure food and nutrition for its poor urban dwellers. Urban agriculture (UA) seems a viable intervention to address urban food insecurity, however, experience has shown that urban gardens do not expand at the expected rate. Tackling this issue requires a deeper understanding of the main constraints that block UA expansion. Benin is not an exception; the country witnesses a breathtaking growth of its main cities that is in synchronization with a mounting food insecurity. Our research aims, therefore, to identify the main constraints for the expansion of UA in Benin, and adopt a three-pronged approach combined with a systematic literature review, a survey held among experienced urban gardeners, and in-depth interviews with stakeholders. Altogether, the synthesis shows a predominance of five main constraints: lack of land and tenure insecurity, insufficient government support, restricted market access, limited access to productive factors, and inequality issues. Specifically, while the review showed that most barriers are linked and could be tackled together, the survey indicated a political unwillingness which in our in-depth interviews is explained by the unperceived benefits of investing in UA and the lack of enforcement of urban development plans. We suggest that Beninese authorities and academics move in synchronization where the former coordinates the planning of urban gardens and the latter provides evidence to trigger public and private investments in UA.

Several studies have, in fact, emphasized their positive contribution in terms of social integration, community health, urban regeneration, and food security, and explored individual gardeners\u00b4 motivations behind these practices. While these topics are well-documented with reference to metropolitan urban areas, few studies have been carried out in relation to other contexts such as mountain areas. This limited interest is probably due to the reduced urbanization of these areas, a preference for other forms of horticulture (essentially those practiced in people\u2019s own homes) or the use of different solutions to mitigate the negative effects of social problems. The recent proliferation of urban gardens in South Tyrol (IT) makes this mountain province an interesting laboratory for practices and narratives associated with socially innovative urban gardening experiences. This paper presents a characterization of all urban gardening initiatives in South Tyrol through cartographical representation. It explains gardeners\u00b4 and public institutions\u00b4 motivations, as well as non-gardeners\u2019 perceptions of urban gardening. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in the various South Tyrolean municipalities where urban gardening projects have been undertaken. The results suggest the great importance of the social and environmental aspect of urban gardens, and an interest in reconnecting with food practices even when food access is not a priority.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3027251468"}}

Growing urban populations\u2019 increased demand for food coupled with the inherent risks of relying on the global food system has spurred planning strategies by city governments for implementing urban agriculture at different scales. Urban agriculture manifests in a variety of different forms, often with different functions. However, within each type, embeddedness in the socio-ecological urban system can vary substantially as a result of specific characteristics and actors involved. This has a profound impact on the feasibility and sustainability of individual farm practices and, consequently, when scaled up to the urban food system as a whole. In this paper, I apply the concept of social networks to understand how commercial urban farmers gain access to and make use of tangible and intangible resources available to them in the context of the urban food system. Using a qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 farmers in Sydney, Australia. The question guide, developed based on the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework, captured farm traits and access to resources through social networks. Findings illustrate three emergent patterns leveraging urban-local, rural-local, and urban-global networks as farmers pursued sustainable livelihoods.

In recent years, the trend of growing vegetables on green roofs has gained momentum as a way of promoting agricultural sustainability in Dhaka City. Rooftop gardens become an important part of urban agriculture's recent rejuvenation and offer alternative spaces for urban markets to grow vegetable products. Green roofs create spaces for vegetable crop production, thereby creating opportunities for agricultural incorporation into urban communities. At present, however, vegetable production activities on rooftops are limited due to multiple challenges that need to be addressed before widespread implementation takes place. Rooftop agriculture can improve various ecosystem services, enhance the biodiversity of urban areas and reduce food insecurity. Food production from green roofs will help support and sustain food for urban communities and provide a rare opportunity to grow food efficiently in typically unused spaces. As human populations become more urbanized and urban consumers become more interested in local food for their families, the use of alternative agricultural production systems, such as green roof technologies, will increase in importance. While cultivating food on buildings is a key component of making cities more sustainable and habitable, green roofs are not the total solution for providing cities with food security.

Abstract Food production depends upon the adequate provision of underpinning ecosystem services, such as pollination. Paradoxically, conventional farming practices are undermining these services and resulting in degraded soils, polluted waters, greenhouse gas emissions and massive loss of biodiversity including declines in pollinators. In essence, farming is undermining the ecosystem services it relies upon. Finding alternative more sustainable ways to meet growing food demands which simultaneously support biodiversity is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. Here, we review the potential of urban and peri-urban agriculture to contribute to sustainable food production, using the 17 sustainable development goals set by the United Nations General Assembly as a framework. We present new data from a case study of urban gardens and allotments in the city of Brighton and Hove, UK. Such urban and peri-urban landholdings tend to be small and labour-intensive, characterised by a high diversity of crops including perennials and annuals. Our data demonstrate that this type of agricultural system can be highly productive and that it has environmental and social advantages over industrial agriculture in that crops are usually produced using few synthetic inputs and are destined for local consumption. Overall, we conclude that food grown on small-scale areas in and near cities is making a significant contribution to feeding the world and that this type of agriculture is likely to be relatively favourable for some ecosystem services, such as supporting healthy soils. However, major knowledge gaps remain, for example with regard to productivity, economic and employment impacts, pesticide use and the implications for biodiversity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3014036004"}}

However, conventional land use planning can really only support good quality farmland and its farm activities as long as the political actors in charge of the management of such land use planning activities are committed to conserving good quality farmland and the farm activities it supports.1 Frequently however, in multiple jurisdictions the land use planners and their local (municipal) and regional (e.g. county) municipalities have removed land from agricultural land use zones to be used for subdivision and /or industrial park development.

Food systems are vulnerable to the impacts of resource scarcity, climate change, and population growth, as well as the issues associated with unsustainable social, environmental and economic practices. These challenges have encouraged local food systems as an alternative to global supply chains. This thesis studies this trend at the urban level in order to explore issues and opportunities for change. It argues that urban food systems need to embrace both sustainability and resilience. A sustainable urban food system has an economy that serves social needs while safely operating within ecological limits. Resilience, on the other hand, includes the ability to recover from shocks such as extreme weather events, as well as the capacity to adapt and ultimately transform in response to the ongoing impacts of climate change. The main research question that this thesis investigates is \u201cHow can alternative food networks help to foster sustainable and resilient urban food systems considering climate change and increased urbanisation?\u201d A comparative case study approach was used involving local initiatives in the Brisbane and greater Melbourne metropolitan regions (Australia). Both Australian urban areas have similar economic development; however, differences can be found in terms of institutional interest and the existence of food policies. The gathering of a diverse picture of alternative food networks was the strategy adopted for selecting the initiatives that participated in this research. The criteria that alternative food networks should attend were the existence of goals related to access to healthy food, fairer conditions for food workers, and reduction of environmental impacts. The thesis used multiple sources of data including primary (semi-structured interviews with founders or members of initiatives and field observation) and secondary data (publicly available documents such as annual reports). The findings of this research contribute to the conceptualisation and planning of sustainable and resilient urban food systems, as well as, to the knowledge on the role and limitations of alternative food networks in achieving this. The case study conducted in this thesis revealed how alternative food networks can contribute to the creation of food provision systems that are aligned with environmental sustainability and social justice. The thesis exposed the particularities of initiatives that, among other aspects, have minimal food loss and waste, supports agroecology, provides farmers with fair payment and makes organic food affordable. Alternative food networks demonstrated to have resilience building capacity, something that is not confined to its borders and can impact on the whole urban food system. Alternative food networks\u2019 values travel and allow the replication and creation of new models, however, not in the pace necessary for a wider urban food system transformation.

Background: Agriculture is among the relevant factors for the formation of cities and it has been an integral part of city life throughout history. Despite the increase in population growth, urban agriculture can offer a unique opportunity for improving the livelihood of individuals through the practice of growing food in urban green spaces. Nevertheless, maintaining urban green spaces as part of the urban fabric presents a unique challenge in an environment where there is a shortage of housing and urban space is limited for development. Allotment gardens might be seen as compensation for the lack of green space and private gardens in cities, especially in dense urban areas. However, due to the long waiting list for renting out, not everyone can get access to growing locally cultivated food and other benefits, especially people who are less privileged and cannot afford private gardens.  Objective: The aim of this thesis, therefore, was to design a proposal for urban green space, Ekebydalen, to show how to integrate allotment gardening with other social activities. Also, as an input to the proposal, the history of allotment gardens and the theory of sustainable wellbeing was reviewed, and local public participation was investigated.  Method: Literature was extensively reviewed in an attempt to identify relevant studies and better understand the context and characteristics of allotment gardens from a social and environmental context, the change in its land use, and accessibility; all in the perspective of the general development of urban agriculture and specifically in allotment movement through history in Sweden. Moreover, Site observation was conducted in a purposely selected allotment garden, Ekebydalen, Uppsala city. Also, an online and paper-based self-administered cross-sectional survey was done among 40 participants.  Result: 6 different allotment gardens were observed and characterized. Based on the case study (observation), the Ekebydalen allotment garden was chosen as the main site for further pro-posal development. (60%) of the respondents in the survey were middle-aged (30 -50 years old) women (77.5%), most of them with university education (88%) and Swedish background (90%). Despite the participants has reported living in close proximity to the gardens, around a fourth of them reported having waited for more than six months. Gardening and nature interest (100%), socializing (15%), food complement (62%), and maintaining wellbeing (65%) are the motivation for renting allotment gardens.  Conclusion: This thesis argues that the economic and wellbeing values of allotment gardens are perceived as highly significant compared to the social benefit that is allegedly seen less. Nevertheless, the social value can be seen as equally important if integrated as an activity with other social activities in a city, especially in urban communities that don\u2019t have enough space for gardening and are caught in their busy lives. Moreover, a design strategy was proposed to show how the allotment garden can be integrated as an activity for cultivation and recreation use (Cultivation park).

In the absence of clear planning policies, the proximity to the city has fuelled land fragmentation, encroachment, and increased land value, thus increasing pressure on existing farms. Using the case of Greater Melbourne in Victoria, we argue that metropolitan planning policies have diminished the agricultural potential of peri-urban agriculture by creating a precedent for more urban uses in otherwise agricultural landscapes. The future of peri-urban agriculture requires alternative models that address emerging issues of resilience and viability. The concept of Multifunctional Agriculture (MFA) presents a useful model to re-evaluate metropolitan peri-urban agriculture beyond food production functions by integrating the environmental and socio-cultural role into local and regional economies.

Our research is important for three reasons. First, as the geographic scope of urban agriculture research is limited mostly to Northeast and West Coast cities, we focus on the South, the fastest-growing U.S. Census region. Second, despite rapid growth, this region has also experienced the highest rate of poverty and food insecurity. Third, we surveyed urban planners who regulate and monitor urban agriculture sites, develop urban agriculture policies and programs, and advise local decision-makers. The study documents Southern urban agriculture changes between 2000 and 2010. It also considers types of projects, implementation barriers, and strategies used to promote urban agriculture.

Interest in urban agriculture continues to expand, as a broad array of benefits are documented by researchers and practitioners. Landscape designers and urban planners are encouraged to purposefully integrate food production into the fabric of the city, using a multifunctional landscape approach that recognizes the value of ecological and cultural functions, beyond the simple metric of food production (Lovell, 2010). Despite the growing awareness and visionary proposals for the implementation of urban agriculture, we have yet to see broad integration in the urban environment. In most cities, the level of food production has not expanded in a meaningful way that would significantly impact the supply of vegetables, fruits, or other products. Widespread adoption of urban agriculture has likely been limited by a number of critical barriers. Land access can be an issue, particularly when property values are high or future development is anticipated. Zoning and tax policies often prohibit or restrict food production (Angotti, 2015) or foraging of edible and medicinal plant products from existing green spaces (Shackleton, Hurley, Dahlberg, Emery, & Nagendra, 2017). Another enormous barrier is the risk (real or perceived) related to soil and air contaminants tainting the edible products grown in urban environments (Wortman & Lovell, 2013). Finally, the emphasis on annual vegetables in most urban agriculture systems may come into conflict with other greening initiatives such as those promoting tree canopy cover across the city (Taylor, Lovell, Wortman, & Chan, 2017). Contributing to this conflict, urban forestry plans regularly neglect the topic of food security entirely, ignoring the potential for trees and shrubs to contribute edible products (Clark & Nicholas, 2014). Urban agroforestry (UAF) systems that include productive trees and shrubs may offer an alternative solution with potential to overcome these critical barriers. UAF would not replace or compete with annual food production systems that dominate the literature and the on-the-ground applications, but instead could complement them by emphasizing perennial woody plants that offer edible products. Mixtures of different species of nut or fruit trees, berry shrubs, and other crops are designed as \u201cmultifunctional woody polycultures\u201d that supply food and a broad array of other ecosystem services that are well-documented in various forms of diverse perennial plantings (Lovell et al., 2017). Several variations on this concept are emerging in the scientific literature and popular culture. The term permaculture comes from \u201cpermanent agriculture\u201d and encourages purposeful design of landscapes to reflect the patterns found in nature and to supply food or other useful materials (Ferguson & Lovell, 2014). Edible forest gardens use a similar definition with a focus on perennial polycultures with plants that occupy different layers, including some plants that serve a support role to supply nutrients, physical structure, or other benefits for the nearby plants (Jacke & Toensmeier, 2005). The food forest and urban food forestry concepts also encourage the use of food-producing species, and some definitions emphasize the capacity for improving urban community resilience (Clark & Nicholas, 2014). UAF could serve as a progressive form of urban agriculture, if the productive woody species are better integrated with other urban planning initiatives that promote sustainability, multifunctionality, and resilience for the community. The perennial nature of the tree and shrub species would provide a stronger \u201csense of place\u201d or permanence, that might help to protect the plantings from development or competition from other land uses. People tend to prefer landscapes that include trees, so the community itself could offer further support. Integration of UAF into city parks and other public spaces would better secure the long-term commitment to these plantings and their proper maintenance. By simultaneously aligning zoning and tax policies in cities to allow \u2013 and even encourage \u2013 a production component, the potential for edible landscaping could be normalized (McLain, Poe, Hurley, Lecompte-Mastenbrook, & Emery, 2012). The issue of soil contamination might also be substantially reduced in UAF, compared with annual production systems. Trees and shrubs produce fruits and nuts that are spatially separated from the contaminated media, so there is less likelihood of soil particles adhering to the edible portions, particularly compared with root crops or low-growing leafy vegetables. Since many contaminants (e.g., heavy metals) can be mostly immobilized by complexes in the soil, the concentrations translocated to edible portions of trees and shrubs (fruits/nuts) are likely to be low. Research on this topic is limited, so considerably more work is needed to truly understand the species-specific risks associated with this application. In the near term, areas known to contain high concentrations of contaminants might focus on non-edible materials such as textiles, dyes, cut flowers, and wood products. Considering the broad scale of the city, UAF may offer an advantage over annual forms of urban agriculture due to the unique synergy with other urban resilience initiatives. Urban trees, as key components of green space, can help to modulate extreme weather events and disturbances such as flooding, strong winds, and heat waves. In addition to their role in climate change adaptation, urban trees offer a substantial mitigation strategy due to their potential to store carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that result from alternative land use types that require greater inputs of fertilizer and maintenance activity (e.g., lawn mowing). By encouraging a focus on productive trees and shrubs, UAF can be highly compatible with other tree canopy initiatives designed to combat the effects of global warming. The implementation of UAF offers exciting opportunities to build capacity for the production of healthy fruits and nuts that could be made available to communities most impacted by food insecurity. UAF might be integrated right into the existing urban green spaces with purposeful plant selections. Urban foraging already occurs in cities across the globe (Shackleton et al., 2017), which suggests that in some sense, UAF already exists even if not intentionally planned. To expand and extend UAF to reach more residents and contribute to greater production, however, conversion of land is necessary. In many cases, marginal lands, vacant lots, and interstitial spaces that have less potential for commercial development would be reasonable options. Some benefits might be found in locating UAF sites in spaces connected to other complementary land uses such as urban vegetable farms, parks, cemeteries, and other green spaces. Synergies in land use or sharing of resources (e.g., water for irrigation) might arise as spatially adjacent properties are connected, allowing the benefits to be extended beyond a single site (Colding, 2007). For land transformation, the use of a multi-strata, diverse planting design would allow for the inclusion of a wide range of edible and supporting species. The selection of specific species for these systems should include several key criteria: 1) well-adapted to the local climate and urban environment, 2) low maintenance and low input, 3) good capacity to promote human health. Poe, McLain, Emery, and Hurley (2013) suggest moving beyond simple \u201cfood justice\u201d to consider \u201chealth justice\u201d with foods for good nutrition and medicinal plants for remedies and ailments (Poe et al., 2013). Some of the most nutrient dense foods that are high in antioxidants can be grown on shrubs and trees in a variety of conditions and climates. The goal \u201clow input\u201d criteria also related to the human health theme, as the use of pesticides should be limited or avoided altogether on plants with products destined for human consumption. If strategically designed and implemented, UAF can be promoted for the contribution to the overall health of the urban environment. Planting more trees is considered to be one of the most effective strategies for adapting to and mitigating climate change (Bastin et al., 2019), and many cities have developed specific targets for increasing their tree canopy cover and species diversity. The \u201cMillion Trees\u201d programs started in the US and has been adopted by New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, and others to recognize the value of urban forests that result from the wide range of ecosystem services they provide. UAF could be aligned with these and other ecologically-based planning goals such as stormwater mitigation and microclimate control (Clark & Nicholas, 2014; Lwasa et al., 2015). The topic of UAF is ripe for further research, demonstration, and education. The potential risk associated with establishing plantings on contaminated sites is particularly understudied. However, even as gaps exist in our understanding of the performance of these systems, the translation of existing research could be an important step for implementing changes in the near term. Much of the information needed to make informed decisions for establishing UAF plantings is already available in the fields of agroforestry, plant science, and horticulture. Efforts to collect, summarize, and share this information could be rapidly rewarded with greater adoption and integration into urban planning initiatives. The establishment of UAF and harvesting of food products from urban forests should be normalized and promoted as an expected component of the urban environment (McLain et al., 2012). With a visionary model built on realistic outputs, we might reimagine a \u201cgarden city\u201d for a variable and uncertain future. An upcoming Special Issue of Urban Agriculture & Regional Food Systems will explore the topic of urban agroforestry. Can we safely grow food on trees and shrubs in urban settings, to contribute to the food security of an increasingly urban population? What challenges will producers and consumers face, and what unique opportunities could emerge in this new context for agroforestry?

Abstract The research explores the multifaceted benefits associated with the implementation of urban agriculture on roofs in Rio de Janeiro. The city has challenges in terms of food security, urban sprawl and the fragmentation of the green infrastructure. The study aims to look at rooftop agriculture as a multifunctional solution for addressing these concerns. The methodology consisted of: 1) LIDAR-based mapping and detection of all the roofs with an inclination inferior to 5 degrees on 69% of the surface of Rio de Janeiro City, 2) Analysis of the city structure and the key areas presenting a high flat roof potential, 3) Evaluation of the growing capacity of the flat roofs landscape and the yearly demand of vegetables in Rio de Janeiro City, 4) Visualization of the key locations for rooftop agriculture in the region of Bangu using parametric modelling. The research shows that 1,385 hectares of roofs would be suitable for rooftop agriculture within the study region. This productive roof surface could produce enough food to meet the yearly demand for vegetables of 39.2% of the inhabitants of the city of Rio de Janeiro. The study also demonstrates the great relevance of implementing rooftop agriculture in the poorest communities of Rio de Janeiro in the perspective of tackling food insecurity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3001320087"}}

In this sense, urban agriculture should be viewed as a significant component of territorial heritage that plays a major role in both the preservation of the cultural landscape and in the configuration of the urban green infrastructure. In this context, the multifunctional character of urban agriculture can be considered a key factor in its resiliency, increasing its chances of withstanding such processes as urban sprawl, road infrastructure expansion, and land speculation. The connection between the economic, cultural and environmental dimensions of urban agriculture and their relationship with the process of territorial development are analysed in the Seville urban area.

Urbanization and agricultural land use are two of the main drivers of global changes with effects on ecosystem functions and human wellbeing. Green Infrastructure is a new approach in spatial planning contributing to sustainable urban development, and to address urban challenges, such as biodiversity conservation, climate change adaptation, green economy development, and social cohesion. Because the research focus has been mainly on open green space structures, such as parks, urban forest, green building, street green, but neglected spatial and functional potentials of utilizable agricultural land, this thesis aims at fill this gap. This cumulative thesis addresses how agricultural land in urban and peri-urban landscapes can contribute to the development of urban green infrastructure as a strategy to promote sustainable urban development. Therefore, a number of different research approaches have been applied. First, a quantitative, GIS-based modeling approach looked at spatial potentials, addressing the heterogeneity of peri-urban landscape that defines agricultural potentials and constraints. Second, a participatory approach was applied, involving stakeholder opinions to evaluate multiple urban functions and benefits. Finally, an evidence synthesis was conducted to assess the current state of research on evidence to support future policy making at different levels. The results contribute to the conceptual understanding of urban green infrastructures as a strategic spatial planning approach that incorporates inner-urban utilizable agricultural land and the agriculturally dominated landscape at the outer urban fringe. It highlights the proposition that the linkage of peri-urban farmland with the green infrastructure concept can contribute to a network of multifunctional green spaces to provide multiple benefits to the urban system and to successfully address urban challenges. Four strategies are introduced for spatial planning with the contribution of peri-urban farmland to a strategically planned multifunctional network, namely the connecting, the productive, the integrated, and the adapted way. Finally, this thesis sheds light on the opportunities that arise from the integration of the peri- urban farmland in the green infrastructure concept to support transformation towards a more sustainable urban development. In particular, the inherent core planning principle of multifunctionality endorses the idea of co-benefits that are considered crucial to trigger transformative processes. This work concludes that the linkage of peri-urban farmland with the green infrastructure concept is a promising action field for the development of new pathways for urban transformation towards sustainable urban development. Along with these outcomes, attention is drawn to limitations that remain to be addressed by future research, especially the identification of further mechanisms required to support policy integration at all levels.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3157130299"}}

Hence, research is needed to understand how regulation on vacant land might be designed to promote a more sustainable purpose to it. Urban gardens are a type of urban agriculture that could be potentiated by such regulation. The aim of this paper is to show how that can be done through the Municipal Master Plans (MMP) legal and regulatory framework for the Portuguese case, by reviewing worldwide good practices on vacant land restorations for urban sustainable development. The paper comprises a literature review on good practices adopted in different countries regarding vacant lot restoration. The evaluation of good practices is built on the achievement of the three pillars of sustainability. Five Portuguese MMP were used, as empirical data, to support the design of a new legal and regulatory framework. The goal is to enhance the sustainable destination of vacant land by converting it into urban gardens. The analysis of these MMPs demonstrated that they disregard urban gardens as a tool to promote urban sustainability in spite of global trends to make urban territorial planning and management instruments greener. An additional outcome of this paper is to categorise different types of vacant land in the five municipalities under analysis according to their suitability for urban garden conversion. The design of the legal framework enhancing the conversion of vacant land into urban garden will contribute to the 2030 international agenda goals\u2019 achievement.

Author(s): Hooper, Ashley Michelle | Advisor(s): Feldman, David L | Abstract: Our global food system contributes to climate change, shortages of accessible freshwater supplies, declining biodiversity, deforestation, unsustainable land use practices, and increased risks to human health. Furthermore, our food system is inequitable and unjust, with communities of color, people of lower socio-economic status, and women facing disproportionate burdens of these inequalities. To address these crises and promote social-ecological resilience, scholars and advocates are calling for a re-localization of food systems at the city-level. Without examples to draw from, the concept of a socio-ecologically resilient food system within the urban context is still largely theoretical. To address gaps in our understanding and incorporate the insights of those already working within urban food frameworks and toward changing current food system outcomes, this dissertation explores how resilience is conceptualized by innovative, active food organizations (e.g., food justice advocates, urban farms) within urban contexts and within locally relevant policies/plans. Using Los Angeles County as a case study, textual data were collected and analyzed from selected organizations, in-depth, open-ended interviews with associated program directors, and planning and policy documents. Results indicate that resilient food systems promote community-level access to food that is sustainably produced, healthful, equitably accessible, and culturally relevant. External constraints for promoting resilient food systems mirror larger systemic risks facing other sectors (i.e., climate change, economic and social inequalities, conflicts over space). Extreme food waste, limited knowledge of food preparation, production and distribution, and onerous or ambiguous regulations are additional barriers. Furthermore, a globalized food economy and environmental challenges threaten the viability of smaller-scale farms. Opportunities for transforming our current food system through urban-led efforts and achieving more resilient food systems include: (i) activating the citizenry to mobilize around food issues; (ii) policymaking and institutionalizing change through multiple strategies (e.g., strategic policy framing), in multiple forms (e.g., formal and informal), and at various levels of governance (e.g., city and state); and (iii) embracing and supporting an integrated, diversified urban food system (e.g., supporting regenerative agriculture, reintegrating agriculture into all urban spaces, bridging small scale food production with community demand). Findings indicate the potential for cities to be instrumental in promoting food system resilience locally and even at the state level, by incorporating justice and equity into urban food policy and planning.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3083741059"}}

A comparative case-study analysis of Athens, Barcelona, Brussels, Detroit and Leipzig. Conventional urban planning doesn\u2019t fit anymore the complexity of new urban challenges (heat island effect, biodiversity loss, human health issues). Instead, alternative methods must coexist with existing strategies for municipalities to be more flexible to changes and stay innovative. This research advocates the use of vacant land in cities for urban agriculture. As a nature-based solution, vacant land presents multi-dimensional and multi-scaled benefits that can contribute to the sustainable development of cities while addressing local issues. Yet, urban gardens in vacant lots are not common in cities, which made the author wonder what may limit urban planners to adopt this strategy. Therefore, this research aims at identifying factors influencing municipalities to include the use of vacant spaces for urban agriculture in urban planning. Existing literature on the topic of vacant spaces, urban agriculture and urban planning were reviewed to help the author identify research gaps and find a relevant framework that could be used as the basis for the analysis of the five case-studies: Athens, Barcelona, Brussels, Detroit and Leipzig. The Nature Based Innovation System (NBIS) framework was used to analyse the secondary and tertiary data collected for each city under nine (sub)dimensions and compile factors that appears to influence urban planners\u2019 decision-making to use vacant space for urban agriculture. The findings highlight twenty factors of influence: accessibility to human labour, capacity to adapt, capacity to collaborate, citizen participation in decision-making, commitment level of land users, contextual factors, funding opportunities, governing style, hierarchical position, knowledge-sharing, land accessibility, land ownership, local needs, paradigm between own beliefs and attitude, perception of sustainability, perception of UA projects, perception of vacant spaces, quality of human interactions, sense of belonging, and urban challenges. The research observes that despite the good functioning of the framework to analyse the results and identify factors of influence, the revised NBIS is not adapted to answer entirely the two research questions. This is explained by the lack of empirical data collected and the overall research gap in understanding how land vacancy is managed in the European cities selected in this thesis.

The social public space is without a doubt one of the most important components that make up the city. These spaces are considered anchors of community life and facilitate and foster broader, more creative interaction between people. But with advancing technology we are witnessing a change in the way humans interact with people becoming more private therefore resulting in an increasingly secluded society. Thus, the social public space has an even more important part to play in the development of urban environments. An effective tool in creating or reactivating public spaces has been proven to be food Food connects people. Regardless of our backgrounds, the preparation and the enjoyment of food is something we all have in common. The social component of the meal was the initial inspiration for this thesis. I was also interested in how the various stages of the food cycle have the potential to gather, inspire and educate people and how these functions can be incorporated in a new public space that revolves around food.

Abstract Research and practice during the last 20 years has shown that urban agriculture can contribute to minimising the effects of climate change by, at the same time, improving quality of life in urban areas. In order to do so most effectively, land use and spatial planning are crucial so as to obtain and maintain a supportive green infrastructure and to secure citizens' healthy living conditions. As people today trend more towards living in green and sustainable city centres that can offer fresh and locally produced food, cities become again places for growing food. The scope of urban agriculture thereby is to establish food production sites within the city's sphere; for example, through building-integrated agriculture including concepts such as aquaponics, indoor agriculture, vertical farming, rooftop production, edible walls, as well as through urban farms, edible landscapes, school gardens and community gardens. Embedded in changing urban food systems, the contribution of urban agriculture to creating sustainable and climate-friendly cities is pivotal as it has the capacity to integrate other resource streams such as water, waste and energy.

Respondents were located in Denver (CO; n = 30), New York (NY; n = 26), and San Francisco (CA; n = 26) and held positions ranging from community organizers, investors, local food powerbrokers, and planners to engineers involved in facilitating urban foodways based on vertical farming, automation, and related technologies.

The \u201cdigital\u201d aspects of these systems contributed to this ambiguity and are used by powerbrokers to obtain further zoning permission than is possible with traditional urban agriculture.

Although food is an emerging topic on municipal policy and planning agendas, a systematic examination of policy development, its implementation and the instruments used at the urban level is lacking. This study was carried out with the aim of gaining new insights into the prevalence of certain food policy instruments and capacity of policy action. In order to do so, we developed an analytical framework to investigate urban policy and planning approaches related to food issues and applied it in ten large German cities. First, we identified different actor groups and analysed their role in urban food policy (level of involvement in municipal food projects). We then studied the variety of policy and planning instruments and their application for different elements in the food system. For the empirical study, we employed a case study approach and utilised data gathering methods of qualitative research, i.e. expert interviews and document analysis. Our empirical findings in the studied cities reveal that urban food policy activities are still very fragmented and often based on individual initiatives within the administration. Integrated urban food policies and their implementation through urban food strategies are still an exception in major cities in Germany. We found that municipal actors follow mainly sectoral approaches, using a wide array of steering instruments, i.e. informational instruments and public procurement policies. However, their capacities for policy implementation remain limited due to missing financial and staffing resources. Accordingly, the potential the urban food system offers for sustainable development through multifunctionality and sectoral integration, is still underexploited. The systematic approach developed in this study may contribute to a better understanding of different policy approaches taken. The applied typology of policy instruments might also be useful for identifying effective ways to implement urban food strategies, to understand mismatches between instruments and different policy domains, levels and administrative units, e.g. at the urban-rural interface, and to design of new policy instruments.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2987856741"}}

This paper present the attempt that was carried out to regenerate the old building to be green and sustainable site by utilizing urban farm technologies based on soilless solutions. Also, the retrofitted building and site aim at strengthening the capacity of the city of Conegliano economically, socially, and environmentally. The philosophy of planning and redesigning the site was centered on architectural and urban farming innovation. Many smart solutions were exploited onto the facades to turn this building and site into a live hub. The retrofitted building includes inspiring domes with revolving light wells to allow natural lighting of Conegliano and to reduce energy consumption, hence, mitigate CO2. Also, LED facades, ETFE cushions and rainwater harvesting as well as ZIP grow and recycled bricks. In addition, mobile application was used to enhance the learning experience, self-learning of urban farming, and what could be possibly done through the education facility.

Recent advances in horticultural technology (i.e., growing using light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, hydroponics, vertical farming, and controlled environments) have changed the ways in which vegetables can be produced and supplied. The emerging technology makes it possible to produce more food using fewer resources, independent of the weather and the need for land. They allow bringing agricultural practices inside urban built up spaces and making horticultural production an integrated part of the daily life of urban residents. However, the process and consequences of this technology-driven transition on urban planning and development are hardly understood.

Within the framework of the international debate focusing on experiences emerging from cities in the global North, this paper aims to explore urban food policies under the lens of a global South perspective, paying particular attention to African cities and taking into account the common elements they present -compared with other urban contexts and territories- but also the specificities and uniqueness of them with respect to the process of urbanization and the linkages existing amongst cities and food. Urban food policies are powerful institutional actions, able to build more sustainable food systems of contemporary cities. These innovative policies are designed with a systemic and cross-sectoral approach, capable of acting at the intersection of different issues and fields such as water, waste, planning, health, transport, education, environment, trade, but also food and nutrition security, self-sufficiency and food sovereignty. We will describe an overview of initiatives developed in African cities, in view of the values stemming from the New Urban Agenda and the recommended actions by the recent Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, as an inspiring and propelling opportunity for new forms of territorial partnerships which could promote new types of cooperation amongst cities, universities, research bodies and civil society organizations from global North and South. Our research follows also the broader Italian development agenda. Under this light we will describe the mobilization of a number of institutional actors towards enhancing collaboration with the African context, drawing a geography of priorities, places and initiatives that are being activated in this field. The paper will identify a series of cross-cutting issues (such as land tenure, climate change, urban agriculture, rural-urban migration, waste management) to create a set of interpretative geographies, comparing cases across different African perspectives (for instance, environmental and socio-cultural) to identify common grounds and regional features.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2982764774"}}

Technological developments for engineering chicken breast in petri-dishes or creating a goo-type substance that contains all the nutrients the human body needs signifies the deepest separation between people, place, and food systems that has ever existed in human history. Despite the benefits of the modern food system, many communities have forgotten about planning and designing for food systems in the built environment. Where once food dominated how cities were located and planned (Steel in Hungry city: how food shapes our lives, Random House, London, UK, 2010), production systems have since become more centralized, often in distant lands, and the experience behind food becomes detached, invisible, and simply another convenience of modern life. As food has become more of an afterthought than an organizing principal of life and cities, planners and designers have become critical to creating a thriving urban environment and reconnecting people to food and place. Great streets have been an urban design subject for decades (Jacobs in Great streets, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, Cambridge, MA, 1993), however, few have focused on how food systems can be a core program and design driver for streets. Great food streets can create a sense of place, be an economic opportunity, and contribute to the overall health and happiness of people living in cities. Looking at street design through a food systems lens offers new opportunities for making food growing, distribution, buying/selling, celebrating, educating, and managing waste more visible. The magnetism, or level of attraction, created by using a food lens to plan and design streets, draws many different kinds of people to the same place for different reasons. The result is a lively and vibrant street that provides a range of activities and services for diverse needs and interests the community.

Furthermore, regression analysis revealed that advanced diversification has a positive impact not only on the economic viability of farms, but also on their social performance.

Rapid urbanisation all over the world poses a serious question about urban sustainability in relation to food. Urban agriculture can contribute to feeding city dwellers as well as improving metropolitan environments by providing more green space. Australia is recognised as one of the most urbanised countries in the world, and achieving urban sustainability should be high on the policy and planning agenda. A strong consensus exists among policymakers and academics that urban agriculture could be a tenable way of enhancing urban sustainability, and therefore, it should be a vital part of planning processes and urban design as administered by local and state governments. However, in recent decades, planning has overlooked and failed to realise this opportunity. The most significant constraints to urban agriculture are its regulatory and legal frameworks, including access to suitable land. Without direct public policy support and institutional recognition, it would be difficult to make urban agriculture an integral part of the development and planning goals of Australian cities. Developing and implementing clear planning policies, laws and programs that support urban agriculture can assist in decreasing competing land demands. This study analyses the policy and planning practices that can support integrating urban agriculture into city land-use planning. It examines current practices and identifies existing opportunities and constraints. An integration framework for urban agriculture for Australian cities is presented. If implemented, such a conceptual framework would allow improved sustainability of cities by bringing together the advantages of growing food within a greener urban environment.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2943191455"}}

Agriculture, through its economic, social and ecological functions, presents potentials for meeting some of the targets of the 11th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). The targets include: a) reducing the adverse environmental impact of cities (target 11.6), b) providing access to green spaces (target 11.7) and c) promoting resource-use efficiency in cities (target 11b). Nevertheless, cities, especially those in the global south, are struggling to sustain agriculture due to rapid and uncontrolled urbanisation. How to maintain (peri-) urban agriculture in cities and their peripheries in an era of increasing land scarcity is unclear in the conventional literature. In this regard, this study set out to determine appropriate practices globally that can foster the sustenance of urban and peri-urban agriculture and determine their applicability to the Ghanaian context. Even though Ghana remains the focus of the discussion, the generality of the characteristics of the cities in Sub-Saharan Africa makes the practices useful to Sub-Saharan African region. The study obtained the required data, through a review of literature, from databases such as Scopus, PubMed, MeSH and ProQuest. The authors complemented the literature from these conventional sources with literature from grey sources such as institutional websites and online media publications. The results of the literature review show that container gardening, backyard gardening, and farming on vacant lands and marginal lands can hold the key to preserving agriculture within the cities. However, these models are more appropriate for the production of vegetables and herbs. Therefore, urban and peri-urban agriculture may concentrate on the production of herbs and vegetables, to complement the food supply from rural agriculture.

Urban landscape planners are gradually seeking opportunities to integrate edible plants in urban open spaces. The new demands to enhance urban biodiversity, food production and raise environmental awareness is bringing into the forefront the need to rethink the conventional ways of planning and designing urban open spaces. The new wave of integrating edible plants in parks and other green spaces consist of emerging policies like the edible city policy or edible district policy. Those policies assess urban green spaces towards a new approach of multifunctional use and on how to enable such places to host a wide range of edible plants. There is, however, a limited understanding of how effective these policies are in supporting and enhancing the integration of edible plants into urban open spaces. In order to shed light on these challenges, this paper evaluates the \u201cEdible District of Friedrichshain -Kreuzberg (Der Essbare Bezirk Friedrichshain -Kreuzberg) Policy\u201d that has been implemented in Friedrichshain -Kreuzberg, Berlin, Germany. Based on the analysis of this policy and interviews with local stakeholders, this work explores the challenges of effective integration of edible plant into urban open spaces by means of planning and policy support. In addition, it provides an overview of the structure and role of the Edible District of Friedrichshain -Kreuzberg policy. We conclude that the concept of integrating edible plants provides a useful argument to promote and protect native edible plants and to rethink the design and use of urban open spaces.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2922289547"}}

A spatial exploration of urban gardening crossing spatial and environmental injustice conditions. This paper explores the potential of the global urban gardening movement to mitigate spatial and environmental injustice conditions in the urban space. After a background discussion of the spatial and environmental injustice theory and an assessment of methodologies that have been adopted in relevant studies, we will highlight existing links with urban gardening initiatives in a specific case study, i.e. the city of Rome, Italy. The case study is introduced to investigate the spatial coincidence of urban gardening initiatives in this specific city (assumed as the dependent variable) and spatial and environmental injustice (S&EI) indicators. Several S&EI-related phenomena whose relevance has been demonstrated are mapped, and their goodness of fit in serving as explanatory variables for the spatial distribution of urban gardening agency is investigated. The analysis builds upon a quantitative approach and features a linear spatial regression model. Surprisingly, findings suggest that social-economic variables generally have greater influence on spatial injustice than environmental variables. In fact, from a theoretical perspective, our results challenge the current interpretation of urban gardening as a mere means to address environmental, food or nature-related issues in cities. Instead, they support the increasingly popular interpretation of urban gardening as a political gesture. Our results provide policy-makers with useful observations about key variables related to spatial injustice in the city and contrasting initiatives, notably urban gardening projects.

With rapid globalisation and urbanisation, urban agriculture is experiencing many changes, for instance, in the preferences of consumers, who require more food security. In many cities across the world, urban agriculture is also positioned for food production and community building. In Japan, interest in urban agriculture has grown steadily, supported by the enactment of an urban agriculture law in 2015. Urban agriculture studies have been a controversial topic of research since around the 2000s in many academic fields, including geography. However, there have been few studies on the relationship between agricultural management, or farmers, and urban residents, although capturing interactions among urban residents as consumers and intentions for consuming urban agricultural space are critical when considering the sustainability of urban agriculture. Interactions are explored between farms and urban residents in the context of diversified agricultural management based on a case study using Kodaira city in the Tokyo Metropolis. Because the area is one of the urban agricultural areas of the Tokyo Metropolis, where many independent farmers survive, Kodaira city is a suitable study area to explore the diversification of farming and communication with urban residents. Literature, such as previous studies, is analysed. Then, public survey data is analysed to illustrate the spatial distribution of agricultural management patterns and classify them. In addition to qualitative analysis from field research, interviews with case farmers reveal the decision making of farmers in adopting specific methods of agricultural management and interactions with urban residents. Hence, interactions between farmers and urban residents exist based on agricultural management in Kodaira city. The classification of interaction styles is based on features of the area in a definite pattern. Such interaction styles prevent excessive competition among farms, attract stable customers, and realise sustainable management. Finally, urban agriculture in Kodaira city is founded on interactions with urban residents through the diversification of agricultural management.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2994653130"}}

Periurban agriculture is being hit by the effects of the globalized food system, as well as by concrete aspects of urban sprawl. Nonetheless, proximity to the main markets provides an opportunity to sustain agriculture in highly urbanized areas. In this sense, an increasing number of local initiatives is arising within the context of Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs). The economic impact of these initiatives, however, is limited by problems and inefficiencies that hinder their capacity to scale up. The present paper sets forth the results of a research project developed in Madrid and Catalu\u00f1a. The study is based upon documentary and empirical research addressing the main problems periurban farmers are facing in relation to local food distribution. Among other factors, these refer to regulatory barriers, logistics, competition and dealing with consumers\u2019 preferences. We conducted a questionnaire with a representative group of farmers from each region in three towns presenting different demographic sizes along with another questionnaire extended to the owners of small grocery stores, who play a vital role in the supply of fresh food in these municipalities. Our research demonstrates that most of the problems arising when dealing with SFSCS can be solved by introducing new forms of cooperation among the different agents of the food chain.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2938464422"}}

This challenges traditional governance networks and re-defines the functioning of public spaces. The case of Parco delle Energie in Rome (Italy) serves as an example of a process of space re-appropriation, planning and finally co-management performed by a dense network of very diverse actors, who established a collaborative framework with the administration in order to re-shape decision-making dynamics. A comparative analysis of international cases confirms that urban gardening is challenging the dominance of a traditional planning perspective worldwide, both spatially as on the level of governance, and is turning citizens\u2019 dissensus into a productive force in the re-imagination and stewardship of public urban space.

The gardeners show deep attachment to their gardens, as a large majority indicated that the gardens are highly significant to them, increase their neighborhood pride, and reduce stated likelihood of moving. Place attachment is positively correlated with knowing other gardeners and perceiving garden governance as democratic. Attachment is also correlated with a preference for garden produce over store produce and the amount of hardscape in the gardens.

I investigate this more general pattern with the case of how urban agriculture became used for green gentrification in Denver, Colorado. This is a city with many urban farmers that gained access to land after the Great Recession but faced the contradiction of being a force for displacement and at risk of displacement as the city adopted new sustainability and food system goals, the housing market recovered, and green gentrification spread. I argue that to understand this outcome, it is necessary to explain how political economy and cultural forces create neighborhood disinvestment and economic marginalization and compel the entrance of urban agriculture initiatives due to their low-profit mode of production and potential economic, environmental, and social benefits. Central to how urban agriculture initiatives contribute to green gentrification is the process of revalorization, which is how green growth machines repurpose such initiatives by drawing on their cultural cachet to exploit rent gaps.

Edible verge gardens, which are cultivated sections of public footpaths created by residents for household and community use, have gradually become more common in some Australian cities.

The \u201cpublic pedagogy\u201d potentially generated by the spaces can be conceptualized as not only a range of garden-oriented learning experiences but also an incremental journey of embedding into the daily life of the neighborhood. Considering this 'pedagogical life' enables understanding of the extent to which specific urban agricuture spaces mediate care, or the interdependence between all human and non-human life, in the function-oriented spaces of the city.

Those trends claim to rethink how cities should be planned, and how agriculture can become resilient and deliver sufficient crop yield in a changing climate. This paper offers an insight into the idea of urban agriculture as a solution for those challenges in an urban context, considering the urbanization trend, the role of cities in climate change, and the issues of limited space in urban areas and agricultural habits. It argues for an implementation of agriculture into urban planning in relation to ecological agricultural practices. Pursuing ecological practices like Conservation Agriculture improves the health of soils which results in a higher crop yield. Therefore, ecological practices in cities are a key to produce vegetables and fruits for the urban demand and to reduce transport emissions. Furthermore, with an extension of green spaces in urban areas through ecological cultivated land, the urban heat island effect can be decreased, more carbon can be stored in healthy soils, and water run-off can be improved which reduces the likelihood of urban flood events.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2973047708"}}

The development of technologically advanced farming in these structures could become an innovative strategy that as an interim solution justifies renovation versus demolition and new construction.

In order to develop a better understanding of the conditions that enable the implementation of urban hydroponic farming in selected structures planning and technical limitations and opportunities have been identified through the analysis of policies, exploration of layouts using Revit software, field observation and photography. The analysis demonstrated that there is a range of possible uses that may be developed in the process of up-cycling of inner-city car-parking structures, of which one might be hydroponics.

This presentation overviews the implications of the food system within urban planning while considering it as a socio-technical system which integrates production, distribution, transformation, consumption and disposal patterns. The production phase of the food system in particular, emerges as a fundamental planning challenge, extending to urban form solutions, individual behaviours, dietary regimes, inequalities in foodsheds planning, and the cultural capital of food. Accordingly, the food system emerges here as an opportunity to identify how current urban fabrics of cities and their rural and regional hinterlands can be transformed in terms of their metabolic function and respond to the needs of people and the environment.

As agrarian practices return to the urban space, a lack of understanding between the urban farmers and local city officials is stunting the development and economic sustainability of urban agriculture. Many promoters of urban agriculture fail to grasp the modern reality of operating a significant venture within a zoned municipal space. A failure to account for all potential stakeholders in the planning of these agricultural projects can cause unforeseen delays in execution and economic disaster. The needs of the agricultural installation must be balanced with the complexities of the city systems, and modern zoning procedures take multiple perspectives into account. There are numerous variables and considerations that must be evaluated in the creation of an urban farm that developers accustomed to working within the rural environment may not naturally include in their thinking. City planning and neighborhood integration must be addressed to ensure smooth geographic transition between the farming operation and further local real estate market development. The urban agricultural project developer will be required to demonstrate that the logistical needs of the enterprise can be accommodated within the existing infrastructure or be willing to upgrade the lacking requirement. Odor abatement and visual occlusion may be required. These complex elements of successfully installing an agricultural enterprise within an urban environment often frustrate successful project managers with agrarian backgrounds and cause them to pay minimal attention to the requirements of urban operation. Unfortunately, it can be clearly demonstrated that to do so is fraught with peril. Without thoughtful design, many urban agriculture efforts have slow growth, and the impact of these design failures on the progression of these enterprises is immense.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2979728023"}}

This was because of inadequate land use planning and support to urban farmers. Some of the significant challenges identified were limited space for farming, limited resources, continuous increase in buildings and inadequate education. Conscious efforts should be made by the assemblies at all levels to develop comprehensive land-use plans to guide urban land management. As part of housing policy, vertical development (storey building) of housing and office accommodation is encouraged rather than horizontal expansion of offices and residential accommodation, which could encourage further growth in buildings.

As an increasing number of people live in towns and cities all over the world, the development of urban areas attracts attention. Urban planning in relation to quality of life and a sustainable society is on the political agenda and in the public eye. When it comes to food, modern towns and cities are today defined by consumers rather than producers. The urban agriculture movement is therefore often perceived as a new way to meet the needs of city life. However, throughout history towns and cities have had a high degree of self-sufficiency. It is often assumed that nineteenth- century rectilinear town planning was the main factor in bringing urban agriculture to an end. This study shows that in Sodermalm, a central part of Stockholm which for a long time was characterised by a mix of industrial production, trade, craft, and cultivation, the fields did not disappear until after World War II. The view that agriculture was no longer compatible with modern city life and the concept of a green city constituted by parks and other green spaces as part of urban planning were connected to the interpretation of modernity in the Swedish welfare state, with its emphasis on rationality and efficiency, which lead to a dichotomy between urbanity and rurality.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3129438639"}}

This thesis studies how the practice of eating together impacts on liveable city making. In this thesis, the practice of eating together is called commensality, which is a collective action that creates shared environments. Through time these environments are turned into recognized meeting places where locals gather. They are called eatscapes in this thesis. People who use eatscapes develop urban rituals and collective experiences that later become urban vernaculars in their localities. These eatscapes and urban vernaculars are essential material agents for turning a locality into a liveable city. Thus, this thesis studies the relationships between the practice of commensality, the urban vernacular and liveable city making. The studies were done through case-based explorations of existing food entrepreneurs in real-life contexts to understand how eatscapes are structured and shaped by commensality or vice versa. Exploring the relationship between the practice of commensality (social) and the built environment (spatial) in a real-life context requires researching design in real life. Consequently, the explorative and experience-based methods and tools of eatscape typology, checklist, catalytic act and matrix were developed in this thesis. These designerly methods and tools are not only based on the specific skills that are traditionally used in the practice of architecture and urban design, but also on experience-based methods that involve interaction with subjects in real life for learning, reflecting and knowing. The results from the explorations show that designers can learn a lot from food entrepreneurs, who have insights on the urban vernacular and the production of eatscapes that have an impact on liveable city making. Furthermore, the concepts of eatscape and commensality are much more than room-shapers for liveable cities; more importantly, they are instruments for building community and making city design more inclusive. This thesis is not a how-to guide for designing eatscapes or for inclusive city design, but rather a reflection of designers\u2019 explorations. This way of approaching city design1 is an opportunity for architects and urban designers to engage and embed social sustainability into the design practice by establishing design ritual. Ultimately, this thesis calls for designers to shift the focus of their design practice from primarily visual-based to a more explorative and experience-based approach.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3177681637"}}

The key objective of this paper is to characterize new environmental, social and economic perspectives and practices that are responsive to the rapidly urbanizing agricultural food system. We used the sustainability paradigm in the context of environmental, social, and economic sustainability to outline the three transitioning states and perspectives (unconnected/silos; interconnected/linkages; and interdependent/nested/systems) for urban agricultural food systems. We sought to ferret out the key driver/response variables and their cross-scale interactions in the urbanizing food-energy-water nexus. We used a five-step qualitative analytical method to develop a cursory conceptual model to capture the interacting variables and their responses. The complexity in the driver/response variables and their cross-scale interactions were identified. These variables were combined with outside dimensions (e.g., innovation, stakeholders, urbanization) for selected scenarios and deconstructed using spider web and causal loop models. The urbanizing socio-ecological systems, across various spatial (local to global) and temporal scales (days to millennium) as well as smaller temporal scales (days to decades) are described.

This isbased on the principles of landscape ecology. The current urban and peri-urban agricultural development strategy is assumed by the territorial order as a process, which can transform the traditional urban model of Cuban cities and relations with their territories (city-countryside relationship); in parallel, agriculture takes on a multifunctional character in itself from the processes of urban and peri-urban agricultural transformation.

Urban food systems are connected with several pressing issues, including urban population growth, resource scarcity, and climate change. To cope within these issues, urban food systems need to become more sustainable in their practices, as well as resilient in the face of extreme weather events. While scholars have started to investigate this topic, no comprehensive analysis has yet addressed what entails sustainable and resilient urban food systems. Through a systematic review of the literature, this paper aims to improve our understanding of the key components of sustainable and resilient urban food systems. This study reviewed 53 publications and identified components related to the health, social, economy, environment, and governance domains. Only 5 of the works included in the review discussed sustainability and resilience to the impacts of climate change in urban food systems simultaneously, so there is an opportunity for original research and analysis. The most frequently identified components of urban food systems relate to: access to healthy food; connectivity between urban and rural areas; having a strong local food economy and food production; reducing food waste; and, having active participation of all actors in decision making. There is some level of consensus on linking sustainability and resilience, but diversity in food sources and the development of social capabilities need to be emphasised for climate change adaptation.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2886055800"}}

Urban backyards and food self-sufficiency. Against a background of an escalating world population, there are now more people living in urban environments than elsewhere. While historically urban households have supplemented the family diet from the backyard vegetable garden, in periods of economic upturn (e.g., post- World War II) there has been a tendency for a transition from household food production to relying on supplies from commercial food outlets. In times of economic hardship there has been a switch back to backyard food production. In recent decades, even in the absence of major crises, there has been an increase in interest in growing \u2018healthy foods\u2019, and thus greater household food production. However, urban consolidation, and the associated reduction (or elimination) of the backyard have greatly reduced the space for household food production. With the continued increase in urbanisation predicted, associated loss of productive agricultural lands to urban sprawl and commitments of world leaders to reduce carbon emissions in response to climate change, the need for transition back to greater urban self-sufficiency will become a reality. Arguably, the major impediment to such an outcome has been that \u2018food\u2019 has not been embedded as a \u2018community system\u2019 along with others (e.g., housing, water) in planning.

To ascertain focal points of local government food system planning, we assessed current municipal Official Community Plans (OCPs) in BC and suggest areas for future policy development to enable regional food sys\u00adtems in the province.

This coordina\u00adtion will require municipalities to expand food system policy efforts beyond their current urban agriculture focus, which has been criticized as having a limited capacity to address a number of pressing food system con\u00adcerns.

Using both review of existing place-making literature and case studies of applied primary source research the chapter delves into how food-related urbanism is in turn being represented in a series of foodscapes from peri-urban markets, to new forms of farm tourism, artisan and other distribution landscapes, gastronomic land uses like restaurants and tasting rooms, and terroir and appellation based places of production. It is argued that the gastronomic landscapes of the urban edge and the wider rural region in a European context offer both critical sites, and design and planning issues and possibilities, for sustainable urbanism in future.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2887026338"}}

In Japan, the goal of land use policy, which was established in the City Planning Act in 1968 and the Act on Establishment of Agricultural Promotion Regions in 1969, was to divide the urban and rural area by zoning in the expanding periods, but many researchers have pointed out that it has failed and urban sprawl has expanded in the urban periphery areas due to loose land use regulations. However, today in the shrinking periods, the need of diversion of agricultural land to residential land is declining. On the other hands, urban residents have recently shown more interest in the food safety and the urban agriculture, and the expectation to the various ecological services of agricultural fields in urban area such as disaster prevention, environmental improvement, and landscape preservation has been increasing. Under these circumstances, Urban Agriculture Promotion Basic Plan was established in 2015 and Urban Green Space Conservation Law was revised in 2017. This chapter introduces the laws and some recent attempts of urban agriculture from the following four points; (1) To promote further entry of various motivated entities into agriculture such as urban residents, and companies which promote new agricultural businesses, (2) To evaluate the mixture of urban and rural areas positively by regarding urban agricultural fields not as \u201cthe place to be developed\u201d but as \u201cthe place to be preserved\u201d, (3) To improve the self-sufficiency rate by the high technology collection, and (4) To balance the productivity and the biological diversity by branding of the environmentally-friendly agriculture.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2885226721"}}

The aim of this qualitative paper is to understand why people become involved in gardening and why they choose environmentally friendly gardening practices. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 gardeners in Lausanne, Switzerland and analysed them according to their content. Three major themes emerged as motivations for gardening: wellbeing, social aspects, and outputs (both tangible, such as food, and intangible, such as the feeling of having produced food). Motivations for gardening practices were grouped into extrinsic factors, such as practical constraints, inspiration from neighbours, following regulations, and social controls; and intrinsic, which were primarily based on knowledge and experience.

It integrates access analysis with the value chain heuristic to identify how urbanization shapes domestic aquaculture value chains, and to map access mechanisms for firms and actors engaged in these chains. Macro-level urban processes drive aquaculture in at least four ways: as a source of demand for fish, as a source of input and capital flows, as a set of activities that transforms sites of aquaculture production, and as a sociocultural discourse. Micro-level mapping of access in the urban value chains shows a multitude of actors who derive benefits that range from direct participation in fish production and exchange to the indirect consumption benefits associated with lower-priced fish. Benefit and access mechanisms are unevenly distributed across the chain, and are configured and reinforced by social relations tied to place-based institutional contexts. Access analysis of urban value chains within the framework of urban drivers presents a means to evaluate the sustainability, poverty alleviation and development goals of aquaculture amid increasing urbanization.

We examine the feasibility of community resource management in these gardens using a blend of econometrics and community resource management theory. The study finds that sex of head of household, household labour, on-plot area, and off-plot area significantly affected the decision to practice community gardening. Results also show that households characterised by food insecurity tended to be the participants in community gardens. Strong social capital made it possible for these households to participate in community management of resources. However, there is need to remove obstacles such as uncertainty of tenure.

Significantly, large artificialized zones create suitable areas to implement UA on extended rooftops. Finally, stakeholders demand the intervention of authorities at different levels (Federal [national], State [regional] and local) as a requirement to develop UA properly.

This is particularly important in the case of rapidly growing cities and metropolitan regions of developing and transition countries. Therefore it gains increasing attention among the academic and planning community. We have carried out a survey among 120 gardeners in residential neighbourhoods of the city of Pune (India). We investigated prevailing UA cultivation practices, socio-economic situations, motivation, knowledge and networking of individual household and external framework conditions to analyse the contributions to the environmental, economic and socio-cultural dimensions of urban sustainability. An analytical framework using composite indicators with index values was applied to enable comparability between the two UA types of terrace / rooftop and backyard / kitchen gardens. Our results show that both types contribute differently to urban sustainability at indicator level, but rather similarly at the aggregated level of the sustainability dimension. Sustainability benefits can be expected for the environmental and socio-cultural side, especially for urban biodiversity conservation and aesthetic green urban spaces, but less for economic contributions.

However, such research requires expensive surveys and comprehensive databases that are usually inaccessible to planners and public-policy analysts. This paper presents an analytical framework for peri-urban farmland characterisation that is operational for public action. Based on in-depth analysis of a Mediterranean local case study using surveys, on-site landscape reading, remote sensing analysis and interviews, we classed peri-urban farming into spatial units of peri-urban agriculture (USAPU). The classification obtained over seven municipalities was later used to train a fractional regression model, which was then tested on the rest of this French d\u00e9partement (similar to NUTS-3 level), to predict the presence and actual proportion of each USAPU in the total agricultural land of each municipality.

The theoretical perspective of public pedagogy is reviewed in order to provide an analytical frame for analyzing the educational processes that nurture cultural legitimacy for emergent food-oriented spaces. As various conceptions of public pedagogy have been used in a wide variety of contexts, I suggest an articulation that assumes learning to be an assemblage of spaces, practices, people, artifacts, and policies, which better captures the wide range of educational processes that precipitate cultural change (Deleuze and Guattari, 1988; McFarlane, 2011). To illustrate the role of public pedagogy in legitimizing emergent food-oriented spaces, I explore two specific cases. The first case of urban spatial policy takes public pedagogy as a starting point for the legitimization of certain spaces; while the second case of the residential front yard begins with a specific space that is a site of struggle with opposing public pedagogy processes, each creating cultural legitimacy for a different landscape form.

Over the past decade, a number of different, diverse value chains have been established in the urban areas of developed and developing countries alike, with increasing convergence in their motivations related to food security and livelihoods development, particularly for poor and disadvantaged segments of society. However, for urban agriculture to be sustainable as a livelihoods and resilience strategy will require decision-support tools that allow planners and participants alike to jointly develop strategies and assess potential leverage points within urban food value chains. In this paper, we argue that system dynamics (SD) models combined with participatory approaches have important roles in bridging this gap, though these will need to be adapted to the spatial influences that exist in urban settings. We first review elements of urban agriculture and some of the policy challenges faced in this growing phenomenon. We follow this by motivating the role of SD models in the context of urban agriculture and note their potential utility in overlaying quantitative models of urban food value chains alongside their land-use characteristics, highlighting the dynamic feedbacks between intensive processes within changing urban food systems and extensive processes associated with land-use and planning. From this background, we introduce the concept of spatial group model building (SGMB), which adapts standard group model building concepts to account for both the spatial context of urban agriculture and enables a spatially sensitive, participatory approach to qualitative and quantitative model building. We provide a qualitative proof-of-concept of SGMB principles and techniques in the context of describing the setting and dynamic issues facing organic urban agriculture value chains in Christchurch, New Zealand. Our approach fills an important space between participatory GIS practices and the development of complex spatial system dynamics models, infusing systems thinking principles to participatory processes, while showing a way to enhance the future development of quantitative spatial system dynamics models more generally.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2528906354"}}

It explores the characteristics of different food growing and urban gardening scenarios regarding the inherent properties of the urban agriculture/food growing complex as an urban movement, its drivers and the niche that it occupies within the city. The papers address circumstances of food growing in highly developed western planning systems, typically represented in Europe, but also other global regions which show different historical and development contexts. These demonstrate that urban food growing initiatives are largely activist-led and tend to fall outside of, or conflict with current city planning models. Where these initiatives are incorporated, they have the potential to provide effective urban landscape solutions that respond to local circumstances, new markets, engendering social and environmental improvement. Taken together, the papers suggest that urban agriculture models need to be recognised more widely within mainstream urban planning and the urban development process.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2767846051"}}

Urbanisation is transforming human societies in many ways. Besides bringing benefits to people in cities, it also has negative impacts such as food security. One way to meet the challenge is urban agriculture; however, traditional agricultural practices are not suitable within urban areas due to limited availability of land. Therefore, the alternative option is to grow crops inside or on top of buildings, e.g. building integrated agriculture (BIA). But, there is limited research and information available for designers and planners to design such buildings. The presented research project bridges the gap between agriculture and architecture by proposing a building integrated agriculture information modelling tool in integration with Building information modelling. The plugin tool has data on plants\u2019 requirements and automatic response to environmental factors. Environmental factors include temperature, light, water, nutrients, air, humidity, spacing and support.

There is a substantial body of literature addressing urban agriculture (UA) and its diversity. But the reasons for this diversity and the perseverance of UA in today\u2019s cities are complex, and few studies have been conducted on a regional scale that focuses on the UA dynamics involved. We took this approach in a multi-scale and space-time analysis of UA in the African city of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). In order to identify determinants of the transformations in agriculture within the city and its urban fringe we analyzed interactions from two main perspectives: (i) between urban and agricultural dynamics in both the city and on a regional scale, and (ii) between land status and actor strategies at the intra-urban scale. The analysis is centered on three areas of urban fringe that have been subjected to various land use changes over time and illustrate the different ways that farmers have adapted to urbanization. On a regional scale, results show how agricultural and regional market dynamics foment UA development by providing commercial outlets and producing agricultural inputs. At the local (city) scale, results show how and why different forms of UA have emerged in specific locations that reflect the socio-economic profile of farmers (ranging from autochthonous urban farmers to relatively wealthy urban dwellers), their access to resources, the possibility of intensifying farming activities, and the formal or informal land negotiations and transactions between the various categories of actors. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical implications of this research and its relevance to public policy. Our analysis underlines the pertinence of comprehensive and qualitative approaches for analyzing the complexity of UA dynamics and enhancing the position of agriculture in land planning for geographically-specific urban contexts.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2760596127"}}

Abstract The article aims at presenting the phenomenon of transgression of the modern urban space through the formation of new spatial units defining the city in relation to its productive sphere. Due to the gradual departure from the notion of an enclosed city to one that is open and connected to the form of the surrounding countryside, the problem of defining a new notion of modern urban-rural space emerged. One of the first manifestations of this phenomenon is the emergence of new forms of housing that combine urban features with food production. Analysis of examples such as EVA-Laxmeer in Culemborg, Agromere in Almere, Cannery in Davis, Detroit and Philadelphia allowed for the verification of architectural and planning concepts related to urban values as a form of urban development of new agricultural forms. These phenomena can be understood both as a process of tearing the compact tissue of a city or, in the case of a less orthodox approach towards the built environment, as a process of network layering towards self-sufficiency of various structural, functional, energy-related and food production related characters within the unfavourable external conditions.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2790082243"}}

Socioeconomic dynamics in the study area, are representative of latent spatial and functional relationships between urban growth and peri-urban agriculture in contemporary European cities. Two complementary approaches were developed (i) identifying and analysing socioeconomic and environmental indicators that characterize changes over time in peri-urban agriculture by linking urban expansion with the evolution of fringe land-use; and (ii) carrying out a qualitative survey on a sample of farmers with the aim to relate farms' evolution strategies and land-use dynamics. Results of the present study indicate that urban expansion affects the characteristics of peri-urban farms, altering economic size, crop productions and social characteristics of farmers, and widening the spatial divide between large enterprises located in the peri-urban periphery and smaller farms in the immediate surroundings of urban areas.

A case study of Wollondilly Shire, NSW, Australia. Peri-urban farmlands in the Sydney basin are progressively being taken over by housing developments. In addition, the viability of peri-urban agricultural operations is undermined by the liberalisation of agriculture in Australia. Finally, the arrival of newcomers and the associated loss of the farmers\u2019 central position in peri-urban communities lead to the emergence of competing discourse on the peri-urban. Due to these mutations, peri-urban Sydney, like many other peri-urban landscapes worldwide, has become a contested space, where different social groups develop conflicting representations of what the \u2018identity\u2019 of peri-urban areas is. This thesis examines, through a case study of Wollondilly Shire, how farmlands and farming activities are marginalised in the peri-urban and how this trend might be reversed. To do so, a holistic framework of the \u2018politics of place/landscape identity\u2019 was developed, offering a heuristic tool for understanding how hegemonic, resistant and emergent place identities are produced in the peri-urban landscape. Two hegemonic place identities were identified, both contributing (sometimes inadvertently) to the marginalisation of agricultural activities. The first identity proposes to accommodate housing development while preserving agricultural uses through the maintenance of a sharp distinction between city and country. However, in planning practices, this rationale is used to characterise housing development as \u2018in place\u2019 and agricultural activities as \u2018out of place\u2019. The second identity promotes the development of low-density residential development throughout the countryside, leading to a consideration of farming as a nuisance in the landscape. Furthermore, a resistant place identity defended by farmers was identified, which aimed at reasserting farmers\u2019 legitimacy in the peri-urban landscape, by considering farmers as using the land appropriately. As of yet, this resistant place identity has not sparked collective action amongst farmers and, therefore, does not renegotiate their roles in the peri-urban. Rather, farmers have developed formal and informal arrangements with various stakeholders, as well as adaptive strategies at the farm scale, which might lead to a renegotiation of their role in the peri-urban. In the discussion, barriers that might prevent the renegotiation of the role of farming in the peri-urban are identified, as well as ways to address them. Levers for policy change that were identified include the need to renegotiate the meaning of the notion of viability and move beyond a spatial planning based on the city-country divide.

Air pollution, health issues, increasing heat, integration, social exclusion, loneliness or mobility problems illustrate such diversity.

The cities that develop by swallowing the rural areas and form the fringes cause problems in firstly the destruction of the agricultural areas which are important in their feeding and the feeding of the rapidly growing cities. Urban agriculture is very important for the future of cities and their sustainability.

Cities account for approximately 75% of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. This, along with the fact that cities also account for 75% of natural resource consumption and 50% of global waste production, makes urbanization a world-wide issue (Sukhdev, Vol, Brandt, a Yeoman, 2017). Additionally, the widely-practiced urban linear economic structure only amplifies the problems of city life, taking goods from far-off places, using them for a limited time and discarding them in such a way that cuts value chains. A shift toward a circular economy (CE) with the aim to reduce, reuse or recycle materials could be a winning sustainable development strategy for cities aiming to lower their negative environmental impacts. Problems of urbanization are only expected to increase. In Europe, cities house 70% of the population, making it one of the most urbanized regions in the world. In the Netherlands particularly, the percentage residents living in cities has grown from 87% in 2010 to over 91% in the last 8 years (United Nations Population Division, 2018).A major challenge facing the Netherlands is the sustainability of the food system that accompanies this urbanization. Cities depend heavily on imported food to fulfil the needs and preferences of their residents. Besides the negative environmental consequences of excessive and often fossil-fuel driven importation, cities also produce a large amount of food waste which is often simply incinerated or landfilled. A more circular and localized food system, in this case addressed through Circular Urban Agriculture (CUA), would address both the issues of the linear economy and the growing food needs of cities. The Hague presents an interesting opportunity for CUA with its increasing popularity, carbon neutrality goals, location in a highly-productive agricultural area and expanding innovativeness. This research assesses the current state of CUA in The Hague, its potential for growth and possible future scenarios in which it is a larger part of The Hague\u2019s food system. A conceptual framework comprised of quantitative and qualitative criteria from various frameworks leads the way into The Hague\u2019s sustainable future. The contributing frameworks are the Urban Harvest Approach, Strategic Niche Management and Backcasting and draws from three domains: urban metabolism, sustainable transitions and future studies. A literature review gives insight into the current state of both urban agriculture (UA) and circularity in The Hague. Using the three examples of macro-level CUA initiatives available in The Hague (the Edible Park, Urban Farmers and Haagse Zwam), network development, learning opportunities and expectations regarding CUA create a strong story for the future potential of the sector. Those involved externally with the CUA sector, such as municipality representatives, circularity experts and researchers, also contribute to the analysis by providing insight into the landscape of The Hague. Finally, taking expectations, interviews and knowledge of Industrial Ecology into account, a future vision for The Hague in 2050 exemplifies what \u201ccould be\u201d for the future food system. The use of multi-level investigations for individual CUA initiatives, the CUA sector, the larger food system and the sociotechnical landscape of The Hague allows for an in-depth analysis that ultimately leads to recommendations for next steps related to CUA\u2019s development.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2902481273"}}

When focusing on food production in the city, you encounter two sides of this topic. There is a technical side and a social side. In my research and design I stress this twofold. The project is about combining these two elements, using technology to make the food production as efficient as possible and incorporating the social aspects of food production to increase the livability of residents and the people visiting. To let these two elements profit from each other, the dwellers of the green and the green of the dwellers, was the challenge of the design. I designed the dwellings for the project, a public ground floor, I designed the green house and a huge conservatory coffering these elements, saying that this is the part where all these elements come together.

This is particularly important in the case of rapidly growing cities and metropolitan regions of developing and transition countries. Therefore it gains increasing attention among the academic and planning community. We have carried out a survey among 120 gardeners in residential neighbourhoods of the city of Pune (India). We investigated prevailing UA cultivation practices, socio-economic situations, motivation, knowledge and networking of individual household and external framework conditions to analyse the contributions to the environmental, economic and socio-cultural dimensions of urban sustainability. An analytical framework using composite indicators with index values was applied to enable comparability between the two UA types of terrace / rooftop and backyard / kitchen gardens. Our results show that both types contribute differently to urban sustainability at indicator level, but rather similarly at the aggregated level of the sustainability dimension. Sustainability benefits can be expected for the environmental and socio-cultural side, especially for urban biodiversity conservation and aesthetic green urban spaces, but less for economic contributions.

Over half of the rural population in Bolivia today live below the national poverty line. As agriculture represents the main source of livelihood for more than 75 per cent of this rural population, supporting the livelihoods of rural farming households is key to tackling extreme poverty in the country. In August 2011, implementation began on the project Plan VIDA-PEEP (PPV), an initiative financed jointly between IFAD and the Bolivian Government as part of the country's National Development Plan. It aimed to improve the livelihoods of households residing in vulnerable municipalities in the departments of Potosi and Cochabamba through capacity building, financing of rural development projects, and supporting citizenship and social inclusion. The project lasted five years in total and was completed in December, 2016. Plan VIDA was implemented in 8 municipalities in the southern part of Cochabamba department, and in 14 municipalities in the northern area of the Potosi department. The current impact assessment examines the effectiveness of one component of the Plan VIDA project. Under this component, the project provided financial resources to communities for the implementation of rural development projects and to municipalities for the realization of production infrastructure projects. In particular, the evaluation focuses on a specific category of projects \u2013 Community Based Productive Investments (Proyectos Inter Comunales - PICs) \u2013 which account for more than 90 per cent of total beneficiary households reached by Plan VIDA The interventions financed are chosen among a set of community-developed proposals and are therefore of a participatory and collective nature. Nonetheless, about 80 per cent of interventions provided involved distribution of new locally adapted (criollo) or improved livestock breeds to individual households. Thus, the project offers a unique research opportunity to assess both its community-based development approach and the effectiveness of its livestock inputs. This impact assessment investigates whether the Plan VIDA project contributes to well-being of beneficiaries measured through key outcome indicators of economic mobility, resilience and nutrition to respond to IFAD's strategic objectives and goals and to Bolivia's National Development Plan.

Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) have been considered solutions for improving poor living conditions in undeveloped urban and peri-urban areas of developing countries. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the factors affecting UPA decision-making, with special attention to land constraints among poor urban slum dwellers in Bangladesh. A logit regression model was applied using secondary individual household data obtained from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and the predicted probabilities of engaging in UPA for each significant independent variable were estimated. In moderately populated Jessore, households that had more family members without children under five, had some savings, lived in their own house or lived there without paying rent, and had any water logging around the house 1 to 60 days per year were more likely to engage in UPA than other households. On the other hand, in densely populated Tongi, households that lived in their own house or lived there without paying rent, lived there for longer periods, had any water logging around the house less than four months per year, or could rely on neighbors through a difficult period were more likely to engage in UPA than other households. This finding suggests that constraint factors associated with engaging in UPA differ in various urban settings. Therefore, nonprofit/community organizations or local governments are required to plan carefully when promoting UPA, which is one of the coping strategies of poor urban dwellers wishing to enhance their resilience against food insecurity.

Dense cities are often perceived as universal models for urban transition to sustainability (Williams et al. 2000). Of course, there is a strong case for considering high urban density as a requisite for sustainability, if only because sustainability usually means making a better use of what is already there\u2014for example, recycling the urban fabric and urban functions without going through phases of degraded neighbourhoods (Whitehead 2003). This is all well and good, but it should be accepted nevertheless that low urban density offers some advantages as far as sustainability is concerned. It reduces the concentration of nuisances and pollution and lowers the density of urban centres that are sometimes on the brink of congestion (Neuman 2015). Besides, climate policies introduce new arguments for low-density urbanizations. Green neighbourhoods planted with trees presenting a high water loss coefficient can lower the local temperature (Boutefeu 2007). In low-density areas, more square metres of roof per household are available than in high-density areas; thus, generalized photovoltaic roofs can be significant.

The economic transition from agricultural based to industrial based experienced by  Malaysia has led to urbanization. Urbanization has put greater pressure on various  resources such as residential availability, high cost of living, transportation, social  amenities and food security. Those who live in urban areas have a limited source of  food as food basically is produced in the rural areas and it is not enough to support  the whole population. As agricultural territories have been converted to cities,  housing area and infrastructural development, this scenario has caused insufficient  domestic production to meet the rising demand for many agricultural produce. Thus  Malaysia is now experiencing the negative balance of trade for the past decades as  the country relies on imported food. With the high urbanization rate in Malaysia, it is  a positive anticipation for Malaysian especially, the city dwellers to engage in urban  agriculture. Moreover, urban agriculture may be lasting solution to the urgent need  of addressing issues of urban food security, urban poverty as well as environmental  protection. To drive the development of urban agriculture, there is a vital need to  understand the acceptance of urban agriculture among the city dwellers. However at  present, the information and study on urban agriculture in Malaysia is still limited  since it is just developed. It very important to understand on city dwellers\u2019 intention  towards urban agriculture thus the suitable factor can be derive before embarking  any program and campaign on implementing urban agriculture.  In order to understand the factors that influence a city dweller\u2019s intention towards  implementing urban agriculture, this study have taken data from 1365 respondents. It  is used to address the objective of the study. The factor analysis showed that  perceived value, perceived behaviour control, facilitating condition, subjective norm,  attitude and perceived risk were the factors influencing a city dweller\u2019s intention  towards urban aquaculture. More so, multiple regression analysis showed that knowledge, perceived usefulness and perceived value were important factors in  developing an attitude to adopt the urban agriculture while facilitating condition  remained the bedrock of determining perceived behavioural control. Attitude,  perceived behavioural control and subjective norm also have a positive relationship  with the intention to implement urban agriculture. Based on chi-square analysis,  demographic profile such as age, gender, occupation, marital status and income have  significant relationships with the intention to implement urban agriculture among the  city dwellers.  As conclusion, the study found out that interpersonal and external influences are  significant to intention to adopt urban agriculture.

Food access is a global issue, and for this reason, a wealth of studies are dedicated to understanding the location of food deserts and the benefits of urban gardens. However, few studies have linked these two strands of research together to analyze whether urban gardening activity may be a step forward in addressing issues of access for food desert residents. The Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area is used as a case to demonstrate the utility of spatial optimization models for siting urban gardens near food deserts and on vacant land. The locations of urban gardens are derived from a list obtained from the Maricopa County Cooperative Extension office at the University of Arizona which were geo located and aggregated to Census tracts. Census tracts were then assigned to one of three categories: tracts that contain a garden, tracts that are immediately adjacent to a tract with a garden, and all other non-garden/non-adjacent census tracts. Analysis of variance is first used to ascertain whether there are statistical differences in the demographic, socio-economic, and land use profiles of these three categories of tracts. A maximal covering spatial optimization model is then used to identify potential locations for future gardening activities. A constraint of these models is that gardens be located on vacant land, which is a growing problem in rapidly urbanizing environments worldwide. The spatial analysis of garden locations reveals that they are centrally located in tracts with good food access. Thus, the current distribution of gardens does not provide an alternative food source to occupants of food deserts. The maximal covering spatial optimization model reveals that gardens could be sited in alternative locations to better serve food desert residents. In fact, 53 gardens may be located to cover 96.4% of all food deserts. This is an improvement over the current distribution of gardens where 68 active garden sites provide coverage to a scant 8.4% of food desert residents. People in rapidly urbanizing environments around the globe suffer from poor food access. Rapid rates of urbanization also present an unused vacant land problem in cities around the globe. This paper highlights how spatial optimization models can be used to improve healthy food access for food desert residents, which is a critical first step in ameliorating the health problems associated with lack of healthy food access including heart disease and obesity.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2765750398"}}

In the aftermath of failed urban renewal projects and the decline of central cities, community gardens have become increasingly popular in urban planning, public health, and environmental circles. However, gardens still occupy a tenuous and contradictory position in the city. While urban gardens are bounded spaces, they are also dynamic places where different understandings of (agri)culture, land use, and belonging are enacted and contested. In this paper, we identify three distinct ways in which gardens in a small Midwestern city are used and experienced by refugee gardeners and local officials: the material garden, the imagined garden, and the community\u2019s garden. The material garden, embodied in the biophysical aspects of the soil, seeds, and resources needed to cultivate plants, shapes what can grow in the garden and the transformations by refugee agricultural practices. While planners tend to see urban gardens as temporary spaces that can promote limited pathways of migrant incorporation, gardeners practice, and imagine gardening differently through social, cultural, and economic interactions. We argue that these practices challenge traditional understandings of nature and urban planning, and can promote inclusive understandings of agriculture, cities, and sustainability, embodied in the ideal of the community\u2019s garden.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2762462073"}}

We review the literature on the regulation of urban agriculture at a moment when policy and regulatory vacuums exist and the acceptance and integration of urban agriculture is uneven. We review the current regulatory practices of 40 metropolitan and 40 micropolitan municipalities in the 4 U.S. Census regions. We find that municipalities are filling policy vacuums by adopting enabling ordinances (zoning ordinances, land use designations, resolutions), regulations on urban agriculture production (backyard animals, built structures, practitioner responsibility), and fiscal policy instruments (restrictions on sales of agricultural products, tax abatement, urban agriculture fees). Our findings support local planning practitioners in filling regulatory gaps, practitioners of urban agriculture in seeking how it\u2019s done elsewhere, and researchers in discerning new applied and basic research projects. We identify 3 principal knowledge gaps: Planners need a complete typology of regulatory possibilities; a better understanding of how local, state, and federal legislations constrain or enable urban agriculture; and empirical evidence of the economic, social, and environmental impacts of urban agriculture.Takeaway for practice: Planners should assess existing urban agricultural practices and consider which regulatory frameworks best support multiple local goals, incorporating a concern with urban agriculture into ongoing activities, deploying existing or innovative land use tools, facilitating institutional cooperation, and promoting inclusive decision making and community engagement.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2762811107"}}

Its contribution to the ecological infrastructure of the city equally is limited but has potential, as recent policies firmly integrate urban agriculture in environmental policies of the city. An important challenge is to expand urban agriculture to the 22,000 m2 of green roof gardens recently created in the city. In terms of the social dimension, it is observed that Mexico City clearly follows international policy recommendations, invests in capacity building and has policies to help vulnerable groups and women. Finally it addresses the symbolic dimension and observes that this is very important in Mexico City, as urban agriculture is seen as a way to restore some of the pre-Hispanic practices of the Aztecs especially the Floating gardens or Chinampas that have largely been lost due to colonization.

The role of urban agriculture in global food security is a subject of growing debate. There are several types of research on urban and peri-urban agriculture, especially in the major cities. These studies usually consist of an analysis of cases that often have different definitions of urban and peri-urban agriculture depending on the local setting and mostly about the objectives of the study. (Thebo, et al., 2014). This lack of steadiness makes it difficult to quantify the scope of this practice on a global scale and presents a challenge for citizens, authorities and academic institutions to provide adequate structure for the transition from theory to the application of urban agriculture within cities. On the one hand, the design of policies that seek the development of regions is framed between two aspects that shape today's world: the global, as a growing economic, cultural and political integration. On the other side the local, as that trend towards Higher levels of self-determination, management, decentralization and development in communities. (Fuchs, et al., 2003). As a result, it is becoming easier for people to get involved in local politics by posing problems that directly affect neighborhoods. Local regulations become much more relevant to the daily life of a person trying to grow their food and feel that they can contribute positively to their community.

Abstract Despite rising enthusiasm for food growing among city dwellers, local authorities struggle to find space for urban agriculture (UA), both literally and figuratively. Consequently, UA often arises, sometimes temporarily, in marginal areas that are vulnerable to changes in planning designation. In the literature, spatial issues in relation to UA have either addressed structural questions of land use, governance and planning, or have highlighted social and personal benefits of UA. This paper aims to revisit and combine both streams of inquiry, viewing them as two co-constitutive forces that shape places through UA. The paper analyses three case studies in Brno, Ghent and Bristol, using a spatial lens that exposes important tensions as inherent characteristics of UA and conceptualises them as tensions within two space-narratives, namely abstract space and concrete place. It is suggested that UA, as a collective socio-cultural process, can transform functionally replicable spaces into unique places and thus contributes to place-making. This function should be recognised within urban planning circles, which should not only secure physical spaces to develop urban agriculture, but also create possibilities for local autonomous governance.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2737475992"}}

The main objective of this paper is to detect opportunitites for the revitalisation of peri-urban agriculture based on an analysis and comparison of its evolution in two different regional contexts in Spain. The peri-urban space is delimited according to density, topography and perceptual criteria. Aerial images and cartographic bases are used to identify land quality and land use changes in the areas, concluding that peri-urban agriculture has suffered both urban occupation and internal changes in crops and agricultural uses, experiencing a process of decline. Innovative initiatives performed in these spaces are also explored as opportunities for revitalisation from a multifunctional approach, linking urban population to peri-urban agriculture, organic farming or landscape management.

These gardens, however, do not map perfectly either onto the accounts of institutional \u201corganized garden projects\u201d deemed to accompany municipal entrepreneurial strategies and/or the implementation of neoliberal governmentality. Critically engaging with municipal involvement in community garden and urban agriculture development, this paper draws attention to the contradictory ways in which municipal actors frame and govern these issues. Drawing upon a case study in the municipality of Vernier, it argues that the municipality\u2019 urban agriculture program serves different and contradictory functions and is simultaneously progressive and neoliberal. Indeed, while Vernier\u2019s program clearly attempts at reversing processes of space privatization and nature commodification, it also reinforces the neoliberal production of individualized, self-responsible and self-entrepreneur subjectivities. This analysis, I hope, will encourage urban agriculture scholars to question their reliance upon a dichotomy between benevolent civil organizations and profit-oriented public institutions, and to account more precisely for the singular processes of neoliberalization at play within the boundaries of their case studies.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2753785953"}}

Vienna is a green city. Around 50% of the urban area is green space, there are 630 farms and the number of community gardens is constantly growing. Not only do activists try to reclaim the city by cultivating vegetables on fallow land, but even the new urban development plan presents urban gardening as an innovative impulse for the city. At the same time agricultural spaces are increasingly under pressure because of population growth and a construction boom. This paper offers a thorough analysis of the implications that neoliberal urban development has for agricultural spaces and practices in Vienna. The conceptual combination of theoretical work on the neoliberalization of the urban with a governmentality approach, makes it possible to focus not only on transnational transformations, but to shed light on specific developments and concrete acts of governing on the local scale.

Urban farming \u2013 a type of urban agriculture focused on entrepreneurial food production \u2013 serves multiple functions in neighbourhoods; yet these are not well delineated. Expectations for urban farming often centre on traditional measures of economic development, potentially overlooking other benefits. Through a qualitative case study conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, we sought to understand community perceptions regarding the ways in which urban farms can benefit cities. Interviews with residents, neighbourhood leaders, and urban farmers in three residential neighbourhoods with urban farms revealed the pathways by which community members view farms as improving neighbourhoods. Benefits stemmed from four primary changes urban farms made to study neighbourhoods: creation of public projects welcoming involvement, physical improvement of degraded space, production of local food, and creation of new businesses. These changes led to multiple perceived benefits including increased social connectedness, a transformed physical landscape, improved neighbourhood reputation, increased access to fresh produce, and educational, youth development, and employment opportunities. Our findings demonstrate the importance of a multifunctional paradigm that accounts for social and educational functions in assessing the value of urban farming and bring empirical evidence to the concept of multifunctional agriculture. Urban farms with strong social aims may appear to contribute little to economic development if measured using traditional indicators of success such as job creation or fiscal impacts, but provide numerous other benefits for community development.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2740385497"}}

Given the current limitation of specific methodologies to analyse PUA dynamics, a quantitative approach profiling farm types and the related landscape structure in an expanding urban region, the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, is proposed. Results indicate that PUA is based on five typologies with different territorial values, as a consequence of diverse economic relevance, socio-environmental weight and landscape prominence.

The growing impetuous to recognize the disproportional rate  at which population growth is occurring (both globally and in urban areas) and rate of  food production remaining stable has entered the realm of urban design and architecture.  Cities such as Singapore reveal an almost non-existent arable land supply, and are, consequently, heavily dependent on food imports. Singapore\u2019s continued rapid urbanization  has resulted in an increasingly dense city; however, a response to the correlation between  density and food security is unresolved. How can such cities address the oxymoronic challenge presented \u2013 to secure a sustainable future food supply whilst maintaining urbanization?

Problem, research strategy, and findings: We draw on a multidisciplinary body of research to consider how planning for urban agriculture can foster food justice by benefitting socioeconomically disadvantaged residents. The potential social benefits of urban agriculture include increased access to food, positive health impacts, skill building, community development, and connections to broader social change efforts. The literature suggests, however, caution in automatically conflating urban agriculture\u2019s social benefits with the goals of food justice. Urban agriculture may reinforce and deepen societal inequities by benefitting better resourced organizations and the propertied class and contributing to the displacement of lower-income households. The precariousness of land access for urban agriculture is another limitation, particularly for disadvantaged communities. Planners have recently begun to pay increased attention to urban agriculture but should more explicitly support the goals of food justice in their urban agriculture policies and programs.Takeaway for practice: We suggest several key strategies for planners to more explicitly orient their urban agriculture efforts to support food justice, including prioritizing urban agriculture in long-term planning efforts, developing mutually respectful relationships with food justice organizations and urban agriculture participants from diverse backgrounds, targeting city investments in urban agriculture to benefit historically disadvantaged communities, increasing the amount of land permanently available for urban agriculture, and confronting the threats of gentrification and displacement from urban agriculture.

This paper investigates the patterns of settlement growth in the region surrounding Addis Ababa and their impact on peri-urban agriculture using an urban spatial scenario design model. The effects of two population density scenarios are explored within the framework of a proposed master plan. The model output was used to estimate areas of different suitability levels that would be lost to the modelled settlement expansion. The settlement area in 2038 would represent 29% of the case study\u2019s total area in the low-density scenario but only 19% in the high-density scenario. Compared to the low-density scenario, the high-density scenario would only require a third of the agricultural land transformed into settlement areas. Settlement development would contribute to higher losses of land suitable for cultivating important export products, high nutritional value and import-substituting products. The scenario approach can support sustainable regional planning for settlement expansion that conserves valuable farmland in the peri-urban area and contributes to building capacity for strategic planning of the city regions of sub-Saharan Africa.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2734394267"}}

Urban food strategies are increasingly being used as means to address a multitude of challenges presented by food system failings. The use of participatory approaches has become common practice in the field of urban food systems planning. These approaches are believed to democratize, legitimize and increase effectiveness of addressing challenges. Despite these \u201cpromises\u201d, they have also been viewed as problematic for being unbalanced and lacking accountability. This paper sets out to compare the creation and use of new participatory spaces in two initiatives in two European cities in their on-going attempts to formulate urban food strategies through multi-actor processes. This is explored through operationalisation of two key concepts essential to participatory approaches: participation and accountability. As such, the paper addresses how participatory processes for urban food strategies can be conceptualised when policy making involves the interplay of actors, knowledges and spaces. We conclude that within the two cases, ample attention is given to get a cross-section of the types of participants involved, while accountability is an aspect still under-represented. Based on the two cases, we argue that incorporation of accountability in particular will be instrumental in the development and implementation of more mature urban food strategies.

The aim of this review is to raise awareness and stress the knowledge gap on the importance of urban provisioning ES, particularly when implementing an edible green infrastructure (EGI) approach as it can offer improved resilience and quality of life in cities. We compiled and systematically analyzed studies on urban ES and ED related to a number of EGI typologies. Our systematic review of the relevant literature via an EGI framework, identified more than 80 peer-reviewed publications that focused on ES and food production in urban areas. An EGI approach can contribute socially, economically, and environmentally to urban sustainability and food security. However, such benefits must be weighed against ED trade-offs, including: potential health risks caused by human exposure to heavy metals and organic chemical contaminants often present in urban surroundings.

Like the dust bowls of the Great Plains in the USA in the 1930s, an alien agriculture has the capacity to turn a delicately balanced ecology into desert. Their initial response was to design a permanent agriculture with tree crops and other perennials inhabiting all the niches from the canopy to the ground cover and below. The soil is left untilled to establish its own robust micro-ecology. Key to this is that the land must be biodiverse and stable for future generations.

Abstract Agricultural expansion contributes to the degradation of biodiverse ecosystems and the services these systems provide. Expansion of urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA), on the other hand, may hold promise to both expand the portfolio of ecosystem services (ES) available in built environments, where ES are typically low and to reduce pressure to convert sensitive non-urban, non-agricultural ecosystems to agriculture. However, few data are available to support these hypotheses. Here we review and summarize the research conducted on UPA from 320 peer-reviewed papers published between 2000 and 2014. Specifically, we explored the availability of data regarding UPA's impact on ES and disservices. We also assessed the literature for evidence that UPA can contribute to land sparing. We find that the growth in UPA research over this time period points to the emerging recognition of the potential role that UPA systems play in food production worldwide. However, few studies ( n = 15) place UPA in the context of ES, and no studies in our review explicitly quantify the land sparing potential of UPA. Additionally, while few studies ( n = 19) quantify production potential of UPA, data that are necessary to accurately quantify the role these systems can play in land sparing, our rough estimates suggest that agricultural extensification into the world's urban environments via UPA could spare an area approximately twice the size of the US state of Massachusetts. Expanding future UPA research to include quantification of ES and functions would shed light on the ecological tradeoffs associated with agricultural production in the built environment. As food demand increases and urban populations continue to grow, it will be critical to better understand the role urban environments can play in global agricultural production and ecosystem preservation.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2606428690"}}

While it is clear that urban food systems need to be made resilient so that broader sustainability goals can be maintained over time, it has been a matter of debate as to how resilience should be conceptualised when applied to social-ecological systems. Through a case study of peri-urban Wuhan, this research develops and applies a resilience based conceptual framework for periurban food systems analysis in order to explore the potential for an enhanced understanding of resilience that can contribute to promoting sustainability in urban food systems.  The evidence of this thesis suggests that the current approach to governance of Wuhan\u2019s periurban vegetable system is building an increasingly exclusionary pattern of resilience. It is a form of resilience building which is likely to undermine broader normative sustainability goals around social justice and environmental integrity and have mixed future implications for food system resilience as a whole, particularly in relation to livelihood outcomes for peri-urban farmers and food safety outcomes for urban consumers in general.  The key lessons from this research are that the concept of resilience can be used to support either a narrowing down or an opening up of normative framings of system outcomes and can contribute to obscuring or revealing the multiple processes of change unfolding across the levels of system context, structures and actors. These dualities in the way that resilience thinking can contribute to normative and analytical framings need to be explicitly acknowledged if serious unintended consequences of resilience building interventions are to be avoided. Six important principles for conceptualising resilience in urban food systems are suggested: to 1) disaggregate system outcomes, 2) differentiate function and structure, 3) analyse positive and negative resilience, 4) identify external and structural shocks and stresses, 5) analyse resilience in relation to multiple and multi-scale processes of change and 6) recognise the impacts of those processes on marginalised system actors.

Current food production takes place in cities only marginally. For several good reasons (environmental, social) food should be produced closer to where it is consumed, i.e. closer to urban areas. Here, it interferes with urbanism. However, urban planning often limits the growth of urban food production. Therefore, traditional urbanism approaches can be criticized and new ways needs to be explored. Insights in recent planning discourse, which gets dominated by co-creation processes, in transitions and in participative planning gives reason to amend planning processes, especially in times when ecology-based and organic urbanism (Slow Urbanism) and impacts of disasters in urban planning (Suddenism) become apparent. The design charrette is seen as the major tool to accommodate future urbanism, which is better able to provide a pathway for participative input in planning processes. The role and outcomes of three case studies, which applied a Research by Design methodology in a design charrette are tested. The case studies are INCREASE-Groningen (NL), Minamisoma-Japan, and AESOP-NL, which can be characterised by a focus on sustainability (food and energy), planning on different spatial scales, the use of a design approach and the design charrette as part of the planning process.

For the most part it is the poor and women who, working on small farms located both inside and outside the city, are nurturing this politico-cultural movement. Their agricultural settings are creating new and interesting landscapes that need to be analyzed from an aesthetic perspective as well for the influence that they might have on contemporary landscape architecture.

The Case of Barcelona\u2019s Metropolitan Region. The intersection between urban planning and food has aroused a growing interest in the past few years in the areas of research and policy. Extensive literature is devoted to food systems, alternative food networks and food planning. Much of this literature emphasises consideration of food on a local scale and the importance of using food to reconnect the city with its agricultural periphery. The main arguments in favour of this new paradigm are food security and food self-sufficiency and sustainable and resilient development of cities. However, food production in the rural-urban fringe is still threatened, and calls into question the sustainability per se of local systems. A rapidly emerging vision with significant support amongst professional planners and local communities is the integration of food issues in urban planning. This paper proposes a new methodology for urban planning in relation to cities\u2019 nearest agricultural area (food cells) and agro-urban planning systems based on calculating food provision and optimization of the flow of food between the two systems.

Uncontrolled urbanization which arises as an aftermath of industrialisation, lead to migration of people to urban areas. At present more than 54 percent of people reside in urban areas and by 2050, it is expected to be more than 70 percent. Rapid population growth and migration towards urban areas increased the demand for food, shelter, water and basic necessities. Due to migration of people to urban areas, the fertile agricultural land has been converted into concrete structures. In many developing countries, due to hunger, demand of food produce, growing poverty, lack of employment opportunities, and the availability of cheap resources including organic wastes and wastewater in cities have resulted in the development of urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA).While urban agriculture practices become widespread and have become a hot topic of discussion in major cities across the country, an exact picture of urban agricultural practices in Kerala has not yet been studied.

Ur.C.A. aims to identify the possibilities and the potential of integrating agriculture in urban settlements, especially in brownfield sites and marginal areas, taking advantage of hydroponic technologies. The integration of agricultural activities in urban areas meets the requirements of consciousness toward food, reducing the gap between production and consumptions, and of alternative sustainable km0 alimentary production chains.

The Finnish urban food culture traditionally differs from continental European traditions. Restaurants, bistros, eateries or street food have never been similarly integral to everyday life as perhaps in many world cities. In Helsinki, the relatively young urban history, strict regulations on the sales of food and alcohol, diminishing food traditions, modernist urban planning and strong public control of the cityscape, have all contributed in limitations regarding urban food culture. However, since early 2000s, demand for more diverse urban food and restaurant culture has surged among the younger generations along with a rediscovery of domestic culinary traditions. Public debates and activism concerning the rigid bureaucracy related to food culture have resulted in culinary culture strategies and re-considering food as part of the urban culture, contemporary practices, and development of urban districts. For Helsinki, the relative success of these changes has been integrally connected to citizen campaigns and information distributed in social media, as well as previous stagnation of both urban food culture and public policies. The paper looks into small-scale citizen-led cases of urban food culture development in Helsinki over the past years, with focus on the story of \u201cRestaurant Day\u201d, its origins as an illegally organized temporary event turned into a global phenomenon \u2013 before its obliteration in a post-temporary reality.

Peri-urban farming is a common phenomenon across much of Africa.

However, the literature indicates that the practice does not play a major role in Southern Africa. Triangulating research methods and methodologies, and critically examining the literature, this paper argues that peri-urban agriculture is a viable livelihoods response to the complex challenge of feeding a burgeoning mass of urban residents amidst declining food production. The paper concludes that the apparent lack of political will necessary to promote peri-urban agriculture is reflected in weak or absent policy frameworks, resulting from enormous capacity deficit. African states must be able to balance the need to preserve physical esthetics of the cityscape with the promotion of peri-urban agriculture needed to mitigate the negative impacts of changes resulting from the changing urban landscape.

Urban food systems have increasingly been recognised as a topic that needs to be better understood, in order to address issues of urban food security and urban poverty. This is particularly so in Africa, which has high rates of urban population growth and high levels of urban food insecurity. There has, however, been surprisingly little work on examining the existing processes through which urban food systems are governed. In this article, based on a review of the relevant literature, I examine what we know about urban governance and urban food systems in Africa. The governance of urban food systems in Africa is complex, with a range of governance actors with competing agendas. These governance actors impact on urban food systems, and thus on urban food security, in a variety of ways, including: the impact on food production (e.g. urban and peri-urban agriculture); the impact on the distribution of food; the impact on the retail of food by formal and informal traders; and the impact on food safety. There are many gaps in our knowledge about urban governance and urban food systems in Africa, including: processes in secondary cities; the role of, and impact of, local governments on urban food systems; the impact of inadequate transport systems on food distribution; and the impact of supermarkets (and their expanding supply chains) on urban food systems.

The purpose of this work is to identify key factors that determine the spatial and physical appearance of urban agriculture, and to discuss ways to encourage its acceptance in public open spaces and the wider context of urban landscape. Because perceptions of urban agriculture are historically related to poverty and wartime, agricultural initiatives in the public realm are often considered visually disturbing, unkempt, and inconvenient. Depending on the context, typology, and scale, several obstacles to successful urban agriculture can be addressed; these include resource pollution, the lack of community involvement, and access to land. In an urban context, agricultural projects are often criticized for their lack of appropriate aesthetic values. By exploring theoretical assumptions through a review of the literature on visual landscape quality assessment, this study analyzes three international cases of urban agriculture in different physical and social contexts. After analyzing the relevant theories and cases, we have identified general principles that lead to the successful implementation of urban agriculture. We conclude that aesthetic values can be most successfully expressed in urban agriculture by identifying and efficiently implementing an approach that combines context, design, materiality, plant selection, and functionality. This study will help to promote resilient and sustainable urban landscapes that help to meet the demand for fresh food and healthy lifestyles, while making a positive contribution in the areas of environmental pollution, energy consumption, waste management, labor shortage, social exclusion, community participation, and rapidly expanding urbanization.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2592107895"}}

An outline of the foodscape of Lisbon: knowledge from the past for a better future. As world population increases, and is becoming progressively more urbanised, cities are turning into the main human habitat. Dense megacities sprawl through the land and contrast with massive scopes of industrialised food production, both contributing to landscape transformation, destruction of ecosystems, climate change, and consumption of natural resources. While urban and rural become more detached, both spatially and functionally, social inequity and hunger aggravate worldwide. Bearing this in mind, how can we conceive more sustainable cities for our future? Food, surprisingly, may have an important role. For millennia, food production, distribution, retailing, cookery and consumption have shaped landscapes, cities, and houses. Food conveys regulations and beliefs, economic and cultural premises, technological and social resources, and imprints them into the territory\u2019s physical space by transforming natural resources, organising our built environment. It is this complex and holistic character that makes food a powerful tool for shaping future cities, one that ripples in several different areas of society. For this, however, it is imperative to understand how we got to our present situation, which transformations our urban food systems underwent and how these were translated into the foodscape of cities.

Third, PUA is strengthened by increasing informal activities in the peri-urban zone that offer alternative jobs and additional income for the farmers. Fourth, PUA in the surroundings of Jakarta as well as in the East and Northeast of JMA has contributed to increasing food affordability as well as strengthening food security policy.

We are now more people on Earth than ever before and more people are living their lives in cities. In parallel, food production is getting more and more attention, not least due to climate change, and the expected climate change. Climate change which both change growing conditions and destroys growing conditions. Food production depends on farmland, but as the urban population grows, the cities surface grows as well. Not infrequently we find growing cities in areas with high-quality farmland. Thus growing cities often equal to farmland disappearing. If we look at the relationship between town and countryside, the growing city population also has moved further and further away from primary production of food. Thus it can be difficult to value both food production, farmland, and the importance of preserving production landscape. If we look at the city's planning, the ideal in recent has been the green-, the dense and the mixed city. However, the planning of the city's suburbs, the peri-urban landscapes, is often not planned after these ideals. The peri-urban landscapes often consists of external trade centers, or alternatively, left untouched without any real function while waiting for exploitation. At the same time, we see an increasing interest from urban residents to farm food, both for own use and to sale. But as a consumer, it can be difficult to get access to farmland, although there is unused, and unplanned urban land that could be used for large-scale city farming. The other side of the story is the countryside just outside the city boundary, the peri-urban landscape and the agriculture. As the city grows, it influences the large-scale farming, it becomes increasingly difficult to farm and the agriculture companies can be prevented in developing their businesses efficiently. Moreover, if the municipality owns of the farmland, they often leases at one year at time, which makes it even more difficult for the farmer.  Thus, this essay aimed to seek difficulties and opportunities between urban development and agricultural production. The essay has looked at both urban farming and large-scale conventional agriculture to give a broad picture. The city of Malmo and the urban farming project, Stadsbruk has been the case study. For both cases, the availability of land and lease times a crucial question, why lease also discussed in the essay. Based on this essays question and the results, I established that the various farming businesses are affected to different degrees of proximity to the city. The short leases have negative consequences both large-scale and small-scale production, for the individual user, the company and the biodiversity. Food production in the city can be a way to build bridges between the city and the countryside, and to increase knowledge of both food and farmland. The essay also conclude that urban farming has many positive effects, but Stadsbruk might not be the very best and most advantageous method for urban farming. Finally, urban farming can be a way to preserve and develop farm land within the city.

The aim of this thesis is to find solutions on how to create multifunctional land use in peri-urban areas and integrate urban and rural land in order to reduce the gap between farmers and the city dwellers. Planners need to recognize the multifunctional character of peri-urban zones and there is a need to change from single-use to more flexible mixed-use areas. Mixed land use, with the inclusion of agriculture, close to cities has been proved to support the local market and contribute to shorter food chains. Urban consumers purchasing directly from farmers has also been proved to enhance the urban-rural relationship.

This research intends to measure the potential significance of urban agriculture for providing sufficient amounts of vegetables needed by the local population in three suburbs (Maribyrnong, Footscray and Seddon) in the City of Maribyrnong, one of the most socially disadvantaged municipalities in Melbourne, Australia. This study mainly used secondary data as the main data sources and Geographic Information System (GIS) as the analysis tool. The results show that Maribyrnong and Footscray, which have lower density and more varied built forms than Seddon, can meet the annual local demand for vegetables by utilising less than half of their current vacant spaces. Seddon can potentially produce 93% of the local demand by using all its existing vacant spaces. This research supports further development of urban agriculture in the City of Maribyrnong or any other municipalities in Metropolitan Melbourne. The promising role of urban agriculture defined in this research should also be explored in Indonesian cities. This also should be accommodated in the land use planning policies.

In this sense, the chapter argues in favour of a more cautious assessment of food strategies on behalf of scholars, beyond the positive enthusiasm that has been so far connected to them. In particular, the chapter calls for a critique on the political implications of food strategies, which urgently need to be assessed within strategies of city branding, and to be tested on their actual consequences on urban regeneration and development processes.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2483559423"}}

Today the division between city and country is becoming more and more indefinite and it is not possible anymore to consider the rural landscape apart from the urban one. Observing Food System dynamics can be a very useful tool to survey territorial dysfunctions and spatial transformations in their complexity. Food, in fact, is one of the main flows crossing the landscape, according to the urban metabolism theory. From the places of production, to the ones of consumption it involves built spaces and infrastructure; it is ruled by specific policies at different administrative levels, but also influenced by private initiatives and practices; it is a complex system of dynamics that changes the surrounding environment in each phase of the chain. Nevertheless Food system is also very sensitive to external pressure given by climate change and resources supply; in this sense a perspective of resilience could be a strategy to mitigate risks and make a territory or a city more able to adapt to surrounding transformations.\u00a0 In the last fifteen years Food has risen inside the urban planners and designers debate as an autonomous topic, representing one of the main material flows in the urban metabolism theory, but since the beginning of the last century it was considered as an implicit theme inside the planning and urban design discourse, both by professionals and scholars. In the evolution of the European urban design and planning, in fact, we can recognize several experiences in which food had a role in the formulation of new cities visions, during the XX century: the Garden City imagined by Howard and the \u201cNew Towns\u201d movement at the beginning of the century; the Italian experience of autocracy between the 20's and the 30's; the Switzerland plan for a national food autonomy between the two wars; the vision for future cities in the Broadacre City project by Frank Lloyd Wright. These experiences rose from very different premises and brought to very different results, both from the theoretical and the practical points of view, but all of them, in different ways, can teach us something in terms of integrating food and productive dynamics inside the urban system.

The urbanisation in the world today is at its highest pace so far in history. More than half of the world\u2019s population is already living in cities. In the developing countries the cities and mega regions are expected to grow in the coming decades (United Nations, 2014). With the growing metabolism of these mega regions in terms of food consumption, waste handling and infrastructure solutions, the pressure grows on urban planners and politicians to adapt and design the cities for the growing needs of its inhabitants (FAO, 2006). Instead of strictly separating the agriculture and the city, a more desired path today is to incorporate some of the cities food production within the city and its peri urban proximity. Small-scale ecological agriculture or agroecology has shown to be one model that fits this criteria of urban agriculture, in favour of large scale monoculture agriculture that is less compatible in an urbanized context. This approach has shown to have many benefits mostly due to its multifunctional nature (Gliessman, 2006). Urban vegetation and agriculture can be used for cleaning storm water, handling heat island effects, serve as local meeting places and parks, add to the aesthetics of neighbourhoods, produce food locally with no transportation needs and many more. The positive effects of the urban agriculture approach for the city and its inhabitants have shown to be found in many areas: economic, social as well as environmental. Especially for the urban poor urban agriculture has proven to be beneficial.

Some gardens are grown collectively, are divided into different plots for individual and family use; CGs are usually located in urban or peri-urban areas. As a growing portion of the urban open space network, CGs are contributing to land preservation, access to open space, and sustainable re-use of vacant land. They promote healthy communities and provide food security for many. In this context, the object of the study are the &lt;em&gt;municipal community gardens&lt;/em&gt; (MCGs), a specific typology of CGs provided for land-use planning legislation and practice as an &lt;em&gt;urban service&lt;/em&gt; with social function, made available to the community by the municipalities and assigned to be cultivated to citizens (usually seniors/retired people). In particular, the study aimed: i) to evaluate the presence of MCGs in the &lt;em&gt;citt\u00e0 metropolitana di Milano&lt;/em&gt; (the former province of Milano); and ii) to define criteria for new MCGs settlement, using existing geo-database and geographical information system to make it replicable in other settings.

The average area per capita of MCGs is 0.68 sq.m/inhab. (if we exclude Rodano, an outlier with 35 sq.m/inhab.). An overlay with land use map has permitted to define the relationships between the MCGs and their surrounding territory. The major part of MCGs are included in urban or suburban areas.

Criteria used to identify suitable areas for new MCGs were: proximity to the road network inside residential areas, suitable land use, not high land capability. In this way it has been defined for each municipality the number of MCGs to be realized and their area, and located the potentially suitable sites.

As cities take center stage in developing and brokering strategies for sustainability, examining the uneven distribution of green infrastructure is crucial. Urban agriculture (UA) has gained a prominent role in urban greening and food system diversification strategies alike. Despite that it is the preeminent form of food production in North American cities, residential gardening has received little scholarly attention. Moreover, research on the intra-urban variability of home gardens is sparse. In this paper, we use a mixed-methods approach to assess the scale and scope of residential gardens in Portland, Oregon, a metropolitan region renowned for its innovations in sustainability. Using a combination of mapping, spatial regression, and a mail survey, we compare residential UA and the characteristics and motivations of gardeners in two socioeconomically differentiated areas of Portland and one of its major suburbs. Results demonstrate that engagement in UA is differentiated along both spatial and socioeconomic lines, with more educated respondents engaging for environmental reasons and more lowincome respondents relying on their gardens for food security. We contextualize our findings within broader urban processes, e.g. reinvestment in the urban core and displacement of poverty to the periphery. For policymakers, our results suggest the need for sustainability messaging that is sensitive to a variety of motivations and that resonates with a diverse population. For a city to reach a broader population, it may need to reframe its sustainability goals in new ways, while attending to the structural constraints to food access that cannot be resolved through local food production alone.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2229835513"}}

Thus, an investigation into whether this resurgence is supported by new spatial arrangements that can circumvent the ever-rising pressure for urban development and from land values is necessary. Likewise, it is necessary to question whether planning systems are capable of accommodating higher demand for allotment gardens as a result of such resurgence. The chapter shows that, in response to rapidly changing urban conditions and planning systems that cannot reconcile speculative development with social needs, other types of urban allotments are emerging which differ from the conventional forms of the past. A number of case studies from 11 European countries collected by many researchers involved in the COST Action form the evidence base for the identification of new approaches to the design and implementation of allotment gardens which substantially differ from the conventional type on green land. Following the introduction, the chapter is organized in four sections: the first identifies urban dynamics behind the emergence of new ways to approach urban gardening, both as an activity and its spatial manifestations; the second presents a description of such emergent approaches, and the third discusses their cross-cutting and common characteristics, identifying the spatial implications for the urban context.

Agriculture on the fringes of cities across the Global North is increasingly perceived as making an important contribution to urban sustainability. As Australian cities continue to expand and encroach on their peri-urban peripheries, there is rising concern about loss of farmland to housing. Such concerns are especially urgent in the Sydney Basin, due to population growth, and topographical and land-use constraints. Accounting for the Basin's farmlands, however, remains opaque, not unrelated to difficulties in acquiring reliable data on the area and value of Sydney's agricultural industries. The problem is not simply that there are no data available but rather that the nature of existing data is (often hotly) contested. Critical questions for urban planners therefore remain unanswered, including: is peri-urban agriculture as important as advocates suggest? Are metropolitan food supplies under threat? If peri-urban farmland is important, what should be done to preserve it? In collating and analysing existing Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and non-ABS data on Sydney agriculture between 1992 and 2011, we outline the need for more reliable and consistent longitudinal data to enable better planning for Sydney's farmland into the future.

The paper focus on the concept of food and agriculture as an infrastructure \u2013 which is both spatial and relational -, within the context of the urban Mediterranean phenomenon, where, with all its political, cultural, economical, social and environmental differences, there is a common relationship with food and food production in an urban setting. The aim of this paper is to explore the agricultural context of Rome, focusing on its relationships with development in the metropolitan area, within the framework of sustainable food planning. Starting from the relationship between food and city, we have mapped the foodscape, identifying a number of representative conditions - typologies - in the metropolitan area of Rome. Through a of criteria - relationships with the urban fabric, production patterns, flows, services, infrastructures, environmental characters, social behaviour linked with the production - the study tries to summarise Roman agriculture. We focus on a set of recurring elements, involving both criticalities and opportunities, that bring together city and food production. Rome has what we could call a compact structure compared to the dispersed urban model and this has encouraged the development of local agricultural systems, where both flows and landscapes involve the city. While production is organised into wedge-shaped areas, the places where exchanges occur are mainly within the municipal area of Rome, with the exception of farms involved in direct sales. Despite a strong urbanization pressure caused a reduction of 42% of the utilised agricultural area (UAA) between 1990 and 2000, this trend was reverted back between 2000 and 2010, with an increase of the UAA of 14%. The analysis of land use (CLC, 2006) reveals a system of wedge-shaped agricultural areas, where short supply chain models can be used efficiently to manage and promote the use of land and landscape. In synthesis, in terms of their production systems, there is a high number of short supply chain farms in Rome (over 40%), mostly with mixed production systems linked to multifunctional farming. The role played by the local food network in Rome is remarkable, particularly in case of farmers\u2019 market, SPG\u2019 and those linked to box schemes experiences have seen significant success. The increasing importance of Alternative and Local Food Networks is showed in the data: the 60% of Rome municipalities farms sell directly (Istat, 2010) it was registered an increase of + 57% Farmers\u2019 market at municipality level and of + 64% in Rome's province (2010/13) (Marino et al., 2013). The local food network behind agriculture in the city, within a number of integrated social agrarian cooperative, who represented an alternative food production system and landmark for many initiatives carried out by the civil society, associations, cooperatives, volunteer and school sectors, community supported agriculture (CSA) initiatives. This account of short supply chains in Rome is inevitably the account of an urban phenomenon. It is indeed the city that determines its special characteristics for both physical and relational aspects. The mapped farms are mostly located near the main routes that radiate from the city to the countryside, underlining the centrality of the flow of exchanges that take place with the city. The processes of transformation affecting the primary sector in urban and suburban environments reflect an agriculture that forms (and produces) new landscape and functions, typically reconnected to the historical value of agriculture in and around the Mediterranean cities. Food, because of its cultural and historical place in Mediterranean tradition, has a significant role in configuring the areas where exchanges takes place, which are, therefore, specific places for meeting and forming relationships within the public spaces of a city. The system identified by the paper configures the set of all the different forms of agriculture and food in Rome as a device of resilience for the city, made up of places where flows, relationships and processes become increasingly more sustainable, and where both physical and intangible spaces act as an infrastructure in their exchange with the city.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2290809733"}}

In our view, the \u201cagricultural\u201d character is closely related to the farmland natural attributes as well as to the specific farming activities while the \u201crural\u201d character is more related to the functional relationships with the urban areas.

Food security is a daily problem for vulnerable groups of urban citizens in developed countries, who face physical and mental stress and poor health outcomes from limited food choices.

Local government is often confronted with these impacts and absorbs the responsibility to act \u201con the ground\u201d in the absence of a coordinated, multilevel institutional response. Health professionals and local government urban planners increasingly collaborate to examine the design of cities and towns to improve food security.

This research uses a case study methodology to gain insights into the systemic barriers facing local government planners in the state of Victoria, Australia, in responding to municipal food security challenges. Four food-related themes drawn from the data show that both internal systemic barriers and an external lack of fit with federal and state governments blur the understanding of food security challenges and limit planning solutions.

Yet peri-urban areas continue to undergo radical change over much of the world, displacing traditional agriculture and reducing the capacity of cities to adapt to non-linear change. Urban resilience is best maintained through a regional approach which connects urban and peri-urban systems.

Whilst the peri-urban space is valued for offering a unique ambiance and lifestyle, it is often highly vulnerable to bushfire and loss of biodiversity and vegetation along with threats to farming and food security in highly productive areas. Drawing together leading researchers and practitioners, this volume provides an interdisciplinary contribution to our knowledge and understanding of how peri-urban areas are being shaped in Australia through a focus on four overarching themes: Peri-urban Conceptualizations; Governance and Planning; Land Use and Food Production; and Solutions and Representations. Whilst the case studies focus on Australia, they advance a variety of tools useful in discerning processes and impacts of peri-urban change globally.

This chapter considers the extent to which market gardening should be viewed as part of Sydney\u2019s migrant heritage and whether this is a useful framing for their protection. Sydney\u2019s fringe market gardens have been the subject of a recent exhibition that sought to record this way of life under threat from urban development. Heritage discourses can provide a primary form of recognition of culturally diverse values in land within urban planning. There are limits, however, in viewing market gardens as heritage. This chapter suggests that the prevailing heritage discourses risk positioning them as a disappearing land use that should be memorialised before the farms are lost to the tide of progress and development enveloping the city\u2019s fringe. Through analysis of the discourses of heritage mobilised around migrant market gardens and interviews with growers, this chapter explores how well these discourses can preserve what is an ongoing, embodied practice that is part of Sydney\u2019s diverse cultural landscape. The history of CALD market gardeners in Sydney demonstrates that they have had a formative role in the development of the city\u2019s cultural and environmental landscape. While positioned on the \u2018fringe\u2019 of the city, CALD market gardeners have provided the city with fresh food supplies from the late 1800s. They have also facilitated the settlement of multiple waves of migrants that have made Sydney the diverse global city that it is today. Recognising the historical role of these market gardeners as part of, rather than incidental to, Sydney\u2019s urban growth indicates that they also have a part to play in the city\u2019s future.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2507393521"}}

This chapter introduces the main theme of the book \u2013 the challenges of planning for peri-urban agriculture in a culturally diverse, high growth city- through the story of Sydney\u2019s culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) fringe farmers. The experiences of these small-scale family farmers in many ways reflect issues faced by peri-urban agriculture in other developed countries: an increasing level of public support for localized food systems paralleled with an ongoing threat from urban development and pressures on their economic viability from the mainstream food system. The diversity of Sydney\u2019s growers adds a further dimension to their story, however, as it melds urban sustainability concerns with another of the key challenges for twenty-first century cities \u2013 the co-existence of increasingly culturally diverse populations and their diverse land uses, as a result of global migration flows. Run by first and second-generation migrants, Sydney\u2019s farms represent multi-faceted cultural, economic and environmental values in land. They have largely been invisible to city planners and neglected in any official vision for the city\u2019s growth. This is due, in part at least, to the diversity of the growers and the urban nature of their farms. This chapter argues for greater recognition of these farms by city planners, and outlines how the book will consider the efficacy of advocacy discourses around the heritage and sustainability of Sydney\u2019s urban agriculture in achieving this recognition. This chapter, and book more broadly, argues that, in contributing to urban sustainability, such peri-urban agriculture represents a \u2018common good\u2019 with the potential to unite a diverse population towards a shared future.

Urban farming is a tool with potential for adapting and transitioning society. While not a new phenomenon, the incentives have changed and therefore contemporary characteristics for urban farming need to be further examined. This study analyzes how urban farms are valued and central barriers together with drivers. Operationalized through observations and interviews the study takes place in Malmo, southern Sweden, focused on two cultivation sites and the two actor groups, farmers and municipal officers (M.Os). The results show that urban farming in Malmo is characterized by a complex of problems traced to the dichotomy nature/society together with a rational large-scale urban planning-tradition. Also, the urban farms are complex due to their multi-functionality and due to the intersection of different policy fields. Furthermore, the views amongst farmers and municipal officers differ. Farmers have a more idealistic view compared to the M.Os\u2019 more rational. The M.Os\u2019 predominantly emphasize the social value while the farmers speak more broadly of its\u2019 value. Barriers and drivers for the urban farms are linked to how they are valued, together with scale and financial support which altogether affect the farms\u2019 status. Summed up, most evident barriers for Malmo\u2019s urban farms are a lack of tools for promoting the farms, along with a lack of tradition for measuring social value. Another strong barrier is special interest among actors in urban planning. Drivers for Malmo\u2019s urban farms are the creativity and effort of M.Os and farmers, to elaborate an increased multifunctionality and alternative care forms of the city\u2019s green areas. Furthermore, a strengthened collaboration together with other actors is needed.

So far, agriculture has been addressed by urban planning through its landscape dimension, as a component of open-space areas. Today, collective issues linked with the multifunctionality of agriculture and raising urban concerns on food safety, legitimize the consideration of agriculture in territorial planning through its productive dimension. However, even if existing planning tools based on zoning can be used to protect the agricultural land, they hardly take into account the specificities of agriculture as an evolving economic activity within cities' sphere of influence. In addition, approaches to peri-urban agriculture often focus on the distance to the urban center, and this criterion on its own is not enough to reflect their diversity. In this context, we propose a systemic methodology for characterization of peri-urban agriculture, appropriate to the scale of public action and operational for the practice of planning. Combining geospatial analysis, field surveys and in-situ landscape analysis, we describe the diversity of peri-urban agricultural activities by the characterization of spatial units of peri-urban agriculture (USAPU) from criteria based on the structure, the functioning and the management of the landscape, referring to operational levers that can be used as an alternative or as a complement to zoning. The methodology used for the construction of USAPU is also transposable to other situations without the need for heavy field surveys. It has been validated by empirical use in two contrasting case studies (Avignon and Madrid). Finally, the method allows to discriminate productive areas that are potentially responsive to institutional incentives and thus to steer public action toward areas where it will be most efficient.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2584144920"}}

Grounded in cultural geography, it adopts a cultural economy approach to addressing concerns within agro-food studies by joining in conversation notions of heritage, place-making and time. By underlining the intrinsic relation between articulations of time and constructions of place, this thesis further maps the alternative geographies of food. It engages with three overarching questions, drawing on research conducted within two heritage-based food initiatives in Mexico and Scotland, both linked to the Slow Food movement. These produce, respectively, a traditional sweet called pinole and 'real' bread. The thesis asks: what objectives are pursued through the heritagisation of food whereby various actors strategically coin foods as heritage? How is time articulated in the discourse of heritage food, and how do heritage food networks and producers understand time as a component of food quality? Finally, what senses of place emerge from the various uses of time as a quality in global, translocal and local heritage food discourses? This thesis explores Slow Food's heritage qualification scheme and the ensuing commodification of heritage food, as well as translocal networks, and practices of 'slow' production. Through empirical engagements it argues that the qualification of heritage foods is multifunctional and that various articulations of time enable small-scale producers to engage with a plethora of socio-economic and political issues. Numerous and at times conflicting constructions of place surface from the discourses woven around these two heritage products and problematise identity formation and narratives of the past linked to producers and communities. This thesis concludes that the constructions of place associated with heritage foods depend not only upon the authority and circumstances of actors articulating a heritage discourse, but also on the scale of the dissemination of that discourse, and on the notions and understandings of time associated with heritage and place.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2899552028"}}

The paper aims to show how farmers deal with urbanization at the farm scale. On the one hand, agriculture, farmed landscapes and the farmers are an essential part of the countryside, the basis for defining it and core of its social representations. On the other hand, under the urban-industrial hypothesis, following a period of modernization agriculture is now being challenged by urbanization. This is happening in a triple process: urban sprawl, not only in peri-urban areas but also in the villages; diversification of rural population (back-to-the-land movement); and diffusion of the urban models and values, even in farmers\u2019 own minds. The question is therefore to find how urban influences are at work in places that, whether nearby or far away from cities, remain country landscapes. Agriculture is taking on more and more functions considered as urban because they were initiated by urban dwellers\u2019 needs or aspirations, before being recognized as legitimate by the whole society. In some cases, opportunities opened up by urban desires are explicitly marketed by farm businesses as diversification projects, but the mainstream is made of rural-urban spatial designs that can be understood as agricultural or urban externalities. The former are produced by farmers (hedgerow landscapes, drinkable water, etc.), the second are tolerated or accepted as inclusions in the farmed countryside\u2019s framework (windmills, hamlet dwellings, highways, etc.). Thirteen farmers (men and women) were surveyed in three local areas in Brittany, Normandy and Poitou-Charentes, by means of \u201cwellington boot interviews\u201d, over the farm landscapes. Spatial features of urbanity are numerous, diffuse and generally well integrated in the landscapes and farm systems surveyed. For these features the paper proposes a classification, a map made on a single farm and therefore a topological analysis of their inclusion in the spatial system of the farm, stressing the potential of geographical analysis for understanding agri-urban interactions at local scale. Most of the farmers questioned give evidence of their skillfulness in making their farm ready for inclusion of exogenous trends that have or will have a direct impact on the place where they work: that is how they generate a new countryside, hybridized with urbanity, which anyone can find at least partly familiar.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3166930460"}}

Peri-urban agriculture is in great challenge because of the pressure from urban extension or the expansion of natural and recreational spaces. Multifunctional Agriculture (MFA) and Ecosystem Services (ES) are two strategies that recognize and manage multiple services and disservices from agriculture beyond food and material production. MFA and ES are closely related and highly complementary. Each has advantages and also shortcomings. However, the two communities have limited interaction and exchange.The objective of the dissertation is to contribute to integrated approaches of MFA and ES for peri-urban agricultural research. It (i) develops an integrated framework of ES and MFA for peri-urban agriculture based upon a comparative review on agricultural research working on the two strategies and application in the Region of Ile-de-France, (ii) and also demonstrates how the integrated approach of MFA and ES works on concrete problems linked to peri-urban agriculture with two in-depth studies on management of abandoned farmlands and agricultural recycling of urban wastes in Ile-de-France Region, respectively. Multi-scale analyzes were carried out for the two in-depth studies.The integrated framework of ES and MFA for peri-urban agriculture distinguishes four categories of ES/function combinations: (i) includes provisioning ES and related functions.(ii) landscape amenity and cultural ES and related functions. (iii) agricultural recycling of urban wastes and the underpinning ES of waste breaking down and fertilization. (iv) environmental functions, which characterize the contributions of farmers to the maintaining of multiple regulating and supporting ES in agroecosystem and surrounding semi-natural habitats.The in-depth study about management of abandoned farmlands identifies that land abandonment in urban area is especially linked to the New Towns and the pole of Airport Charles-de-Gaulle. In rural area, the reason is usually linked to poor agronomical conditions. Perceptions of local actors of ES and disservices of abandoned farmlands differ with the geographical area and scale. The actors prefer a MFA strategy for the reuse of abandoned farmlands.The second in-depth study finds out that the production of sewage sludge spatially mismatches with the distribution of agricultural lands. Land application of sewage sludge is withdrawing from the peri-urban area in the western part of Ile-de-France. Contrarily, green waste compost is becoming popular. A framework concludes the multiscale influences on the supply-demand relationship regarding urban wastes, followed by a classification of seven categories of farmers.The integrated framework of ES and MFA, and the multi-scale approach for in-depth studies will be interesting for application in other conditions.

The aim of this paper is to understand whether an integrated approach that incorporates the ideas of planners, urban designers, landscape architects, health professionals and the food industry could improve food security. The City of Charles Sturt is used as a case study. A number of key stakeholders of food security have been interviewed to determine the key challenges and recommendations for food security both at the state and local government level. A food security policy has been identified as the key solution for the City of Charles Sturt to improve food security in the area, but it is understood that the key to its success is the knowledge and awareness of the community and their adoption of the initiatives. There is a need to adopt an integrated and multi-disciplinary approach to food security with several government departments sharing knowledge and collaborating within their respective roles, across the three tiers of government and community.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2415346862"}}

Despite the importance of urban agriculture in developing countries, urban agriculture is not well understood by public authorities. This lack of knowledge impedes its inclusion in public policies of urban planning. A substantial body of literature deals with urban agriculture but little research has analyzed the multidimensional city-agriculture interactions facilitating its enduring presence within the city. We suggest the hypothesis that informal processes are at the core of the persistence of urban agriculture and propose the concept of socio-spatial arrangements (SSAs) between the actors. To study urban agriculture in Bobo-Dioulasso, a West African city, we propose to develop a geography of arrangements to understand the social and spatial characteristics of SSAs and the way they influence urban agriculture development. Taking the example of market gardeners and pig breeders, we highlight how farmers overcome urban constraints through localized social networks. Results show that arrangements between the actors are at the core of the persistence of urban agriculture. We underline two different socio-spatial morphologies (SSMs) of urban agriculture according to differences in urban agriculture characteristics. These SSMs illustrate how market gardeners and pig breeders integrate differently into the urban space. The systemic approach of studying arrangements between actors helps us understand how urban farming activities function, and how they are connected to each other and to the urban and regional system, thus building a picture of an agri-urban system. We discuss the policy and theoretical implications of this research. This study is aimed at providing a better understanding of urban agriculture that can enhance its consideration as a viable component of the city.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1922210642"}}

Rapid urbanization in Asia puts strong pressure on densely populated agricultural land in the peri-urban zone. It has created a specific feature, namely \u2018Desakota\u2019, as a mixed urban\u2013rural zone which has been proposed to play an important role to support urban sustainability. However, preserving agriculture during urban expansion is hampered by the lack of understanding of its character and its economic, social, and ecological roles within the urban system. This research analyzed urbanization patterns in Jabodetabek Metropolitan Area (JMA) with Indonesia\u2019s capital Jakarta at its core, and the dynamics of peri-urban agriculture in this context. Land use change analysis, descriptive and multivariate statistical approaches of social-economic panel data, and spatial mapping and clustering of agricultural types were applied. Results showed that rapid urbanization still continues at low development densities. It has led to the large-scale loss of farmland and increased land fragmentation. Interestingly, peri-urban agriculture still persisted and was even strengthened when JMA was hit by the economic crisis. While the area of agricultural land suffered heavy losses, the overall decline was less than expected due to conversion of woodlands into farmland. The number of farmers even increased but mostly because of a steep rise in landless farmers. Moreover, many peri-urban dwellers were still involved in on-farm and off-farm activities. We distinguished 10 agricultural types. Lowland horticulture and inland aquaculture were able to adapt and even benefit from urbanization due to proximity to the nearby urban market, whereas paddy fields, food crops and livestock were mostly displaced by urbanization and moved to the non-urbanized area. These results shed new light on the dynamics of peri-urban agriculture and indicate its persistent role in the peri-urban economy as well as supporting urban resilience during an economic crisis. Therefore, peri-urban agriculture should be regarded as a vital element of a megacity.

This research is based on a case study of the Wa Municipality in order to assess the influences of customary land allocation and peri-urbanization on land use planning and foods systems in Ghana using explorative and narrative research approaches. The study identified that customary stakeholders responsible for allocating such lands in the Wa Municipality were indiscriminately converting large tracts of hitherto agricultural lands to urban land uses. Statutorily prepared land use plans are hardly enforced and the planning priorities are on residential and commercial land uses that command higher land values to the detriment of agricultural lands. Weak institutional linkages also characterize the mandated planning and land administration institutions, with a planning system that is reactive rather than proactive in addressing development control challenges across the country. There is the need for planning authorities to adopt participatory land uses planning together with customary landholders and educating them on the essence of comprehensive land use planning approaches.

Because such areas do not always have good access to nutritionally adequate food, the question of how to supply them is an urgent priority in order to maintain a healthy population. Urban and peri-urban agriculture, as sources of local fresh food, could play an important role. Whereas some scholars do not differentiate between peri-urban and urban agriculture, seeing them as a single entity, our hypothesis is that they are distinct, and that this has important consequences for food security and other issues. This has knock-on effects for food system planning and has not yet been appropriately analysed. The objectives of this study are to provide a systematic understanding of urban and peri-urban agriculture in the Global North, showing their similarities and differences, and to analyse their impact on urban food security. To this end, an extensive literature review was conducted, resulting in the identification and comparison of their spatial, ecological and socio-economic characteristics. The findings are discussed in terms of their impact on food security in relation to the four levels of the food system: food production, processing, distribution and consumption. The results show that urban and peri-urban agriculture in the Global North indeed differ in most of their characteristics and consequently also in their ability to meet the food needs of urban inhabitants. While urban agriculture still meets food needs mainly at the household level, peri-urban agriculture can provide larger quantities and has broader distribution pathways, giving it a separate status in terms of food security.

This paper investigates if engaging citizens as design agents by providing a platform for alternate participation can bridge this gap, through the transfer of spatial agency and new modes of critical cartography. To assess whether this is the case, the approaches are applied to Stockholm\u2019s urban agriculture movement in a staged intervention. The aim of the intervention was to engage citizens in locating existing and potential places for growing food and in gathering information from these sites to inform design in urban agriculture. The design-based methodologies incorporated digital and bodily interfaces for this cartography to take place. The Urban CoMapper, a smartphone digital app, captured real-time perspectives through crowd-sourced mapping. In the bodily cartography, participant\u2019s used their bodies to trace the site and reveal their sensorial perceptions. The data gathered from these approaches gave way to a mode of artistic research for exploring urban agriculture, along with inviting artists to be engaged in the dialogues. In sum, results showed that a combination of digital and bodily approaches was necessary for a critical cartography if we want to engage citizens holistically into the urban design process as spatial agents informing urban policy. Such methodologies formed a reflective interrogation and encouraged a new intimacy with nature, in this instance, one that can transform our urban conduct by questioning our eating habits: where we get our food from and how we eat it seasonally.

Using the case of an economically declined neighbourhood in the post-industrial German Ruhr Area (sometimes characterized as Germany\u2019s \u201cRust Belt\u201d), we analyse, describe and conclude how urban agriculture can be used as a catalyst to stimulate and support urban renewal and regeneration, especially from a socio-cultural perspective. Using the methodological framework of participatory action research, and linking bottom-up and top-down planning approaches, a project path was developed to include the population affected and foster individual responsibility for their district, as well as to strengthen inhabitants and stakeholder groups in a permanent collective stewardship for the individual forms of urban agriculture developed and implemented. On a more abstract level, the research carried out can be characterized as a form of action research with an intended transgression of the boundaries between research, planning, design, and implementation. We conclude that by synchronously combining those four domains with intense feedback loops, synergies for the academic knowledge on the potential performance of urban agriculture in terms of sustainable development, as well as the benefits for the case-study area and the interests of individual urban gardeners can be achieved.

The paper deals with some relevant and contradictory aspects of urban and peri-urban agriculture in Italy: the traditional exclusion of agricultural areas from the goals of territorial planning; the separation between top-down policies and bottom-up practices; the lack of agricultural policies at local scale. In the first part the paper summarises the weak relation between urban planning and agriculture, showing how in Italy this gap has been only partially overcome by new laws and plans. Moreover the paper focuses on how, due to the lack of suitable solutions coming from regional and local planning, a large number of vibrant initiatives were started by local stakeholders. In order to show the limitations and the potentialities of these various approaches, three peculiar experiences based on Milan, Turin and Pisa are presented.

Extensive research has been conducted on urban agriculture policies in the global South, but much less is known about associated practices and policies in the global North. This is especially true for the Canadian context and therefore the present study aims at improving our overall understanding of the urban agriculture situation in two Canadian provinces. Relevant policies, such as official plans or official community plans, alternate policy documents and guidelines, zoning by-laws, and animal-related by-laws were reviewed for 10 municipalities in Ontario and in British Columbia, all varying in socio-economic and climatological characteristics. Additional key informant interviews were conducted with municipal planners, community garden coordinators, and other municipal staff familiar with urban agriculture policies from six of the selected municipalities. In line with global trends, our results suggest that urban agriculture is becoming more widespread in the two provinces. However, even though all studied municipalities consistently support urban agriculture, they vary significantly in their approach, with some municipalities focusing much more narrowly on certain types of activities than others. Overall, community advocacy and municipal council support are the most important drivers in the policy process. Key informants expressed a need to bridge existing gaps between policy adoption and implementation of tools, emphasize public education and public awareness, create inventories of land available for urban agriculture, incorporate urban agriculture in the development review process, and focus on the commercial potential of the practice.

This review paper examines current trends in urban agriculture from a global perspective as a mitigation-adaptation approach to climate change adaptation in the midst of a growing world population. Employing vegetation as a carbon capture and storage system encapsulates a soft-engineering strategy that can be easily deployed by planners and environmental managers. In this review, urban agriculture is presented as a land-use solution to counteract the effects of urbanization, and as a means to establish a continuum between cities and the countryside. It espouses the usefulness of urban agriculture to enhance food security while sequestering carbon. As part of urban greening (including newer approaches, such as green roofs and gardens as well as more established forms of greening, such as forests and parks), urban agriculture offers traditionally rural services in cities, thereby contributing to food resources as well as working to alleviate pressing social issues like poverty. It also provides a way to reduce stress on farmland, and creates opportunities for employment and community-building. As part of greening, urban agriculture provides a buffer for pollution and improves environmental (and well as human) health and well-being. This review begins by addressing the physical factors of adopting urban agriculture, such as climate change and development, land use and degradation, technology and management, and experimental findings as well as human factors investigated in the published literature.

Based on a qualitative study of Hanoi underprivileged households\u2019 livelihoods, this article addresses the role of urban and periurban agriculture in the food securitization process. It begins by showing that the spatial dynamics occurring in the emerging metropolis induce strong competition for the various uses of land. The urbanization process is based on a tremendous land-seizure policy, and officials seem to regard farmland as a land reserve instead of as a source of food. However, as a source of cheap, diversified, and safe food, and as a component of households\u2019 livelihoods, urban agriculture plays a specific role in food-securitization strategies, especially for low-income households by reducing their food vulnerability in both short- and long-term; hence, it is a factor of resilience. Because the urbanization process that jeopardizes access to land seems particularly damaging for those households, urban planning is reconsidered from a spatial justice perspective. The food securitization approach, focusing on actors\u2019 strategies, indicates how urban planning generates rising inequalities in the emerging metropolis. This study proposes that the current pattern of urban development induces spatial injustice in access to urban resources and land, thereby increasing inequalities in urban dwellers\u2019 ability to manage their food security situation.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2253747638"}}

Through our understanding and synthesis of multiple studies, we propose a set of design patterns.

The relationships between the patterns and their concurrent use are discussed, and the resulting links provided the foundation for a pattern language.

As many parts of the world are facing an ever increasing challenge of urbanization, absolute and relative growth in urban poverty and food insecurity are becoming a challenge. Urban Agriculture (UA) which entails production, processing and selling of food and other products within and around cities and towns is gaining ground as a mitigating measure to these challenges in many urban centres worldwide. There is now a general recognition of the importance of UA in most countries of the world and in the African continent in particular. Available literature shows that over the past ten (10) years, rapid growth in interest and activity in UA has increased tremendously (Urban Harvest, 2008, Mbiba, 1998, 1999; LeeSmith, 1998). Urban Agriculture could therefore become an instrument that could tackle household food insecurity if geared towards increasing urban food production and employment by encouraging productive participation in urban development. According to the United Nations Habitat, UA in many cities play a critical role in sustaining the integrity of the environment and in contributing significantly to the attainment of food self-reliance by improvement of livelihoods of the urban poor, through cultivation of a wide range of crops and rearing of livestock with substantial yields. However UA still receives the least priority in many countries, particularly in the area of development planning (United Nations, 2005; UN-Habitat, 2006). This paper investigated the contribution of Urban Agriculture to the food security of residents of Eldoret Municipality, Kenya with the aim of laying the foundation for future policy formulation for Urban Agriculture in Kenya.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2557190447"}}

This chapter explores urban agriculture in Africa, which to date has had relatively little exposure in the academic literature. Further, this chapter focuses on three major cities across the continent: Harare (Zimbabwe), Nairobi (Kenya) and Johannesburg (South Africa). In each case, an overview is provided of urban agricultural activities, authority responses to the practice and an evaluation of the soil properties in which the agriculture occurs. This overview of urban agriculture in selected African cities, particularly the exploration of soil quality and contamination issues breaks new ground since it features one of the first reviews of urban agriculture and soils. Ultimately, this piece aims to provide an insight into practices on the African continent and pave the way for subsequent research. While this review provides evidence to suggest that urban agriculture is still a peripheral component of urban land use in many African cities, it does suggest that the continual search for food security among the urban poor is expanding the practice. However, unless major steps are taken, there will be continual contamination and degradation of soils that, in turn, will further constrain urban food security especially among poor households. Hence, the observation that disjointed practices being experienced in African cities can only be resolved if the nexus between urban land-use planning, food security policies, urban environmental policies and urban health policies is achieved. Further research is required to explore the impact of this type of practice on the African continent: providing empirical material to suggest the potential for urban agriculture and whether populations are able to use this practice to become self-sufficient.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W46779600"}}

Vitoria-Gateiz has experimented an important urban outgrowth in the last decade, mainly through the planning and development of two new neighborhoods, Zabalgana and Salburua, situated at the eastern and western border of the city, by the Greenbelt. These new development are well-equipped and designed according to sustainability principles. Nevertheless, among the main problems they present is their over-dimensioned public space, which creates some areas lacking enough density and mix of uses. On the other hand it is very expensive for the municipality to maintain these public space with the high Vitorian urban standards for public space. The proposed solution for this problem is a strategy of re-densification through the insertion of new uses The debate has arisen about which are the most adequate uses to insert in order to get an increasing of urban vitality, specially considering that housing has reached its peak and that Vitoria-Gasteiz is well served with social and sport amenities.  The main goal of the TS was to offer an opportunity for the reflection about how urban agriculture might be an optimal alternative for the re-qualifying of this over-dimensioned public space in the new neighbourhoods, especially considering it synergic potential as a tool for production, leisure and landscaping, including the possibility of energy crops within the limits of urban space. Continuity with rural and natural surrounding area through alternatives for urban fringe at the small scale is a relevant issue to be considered as well within the reflection.

Abstract. Urbanization and gardening, due to the hot and dry weather in Iran, always have been coordinated and interconnected trends. The combination of these two trends could create the concept of Iranian sustainable city. These cities were a combination of gardens and farms in the midst of urban context that offered favorable environmental conditions for citizens and natural urban organs and provided coordination with difficult climate conditions and water supply shortages. In fact, these cities have been self-sufficient and sustainable cities connected with the culture of past people over the thousands of years and formed a part of their identity. These cities that truly had combined nature, culture, economy, and society together, today are destroying\u00a0 and demolishing in the process of development that could cause a break in the chain of environmental sustainability. Qazvin is an example of these cities, which is surrounded by a belt-like traditional gardens and has created an appropriate urban environment. Todays, the environment of these gardens, which have key role in the environment of Qazvin city, is in the path of destruction and elimination. Accordingly, conservation and restoration of local urban agriculture could be effective in the process of environmental sustainabity of Iranian cities.

The paper deals with the issue of urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) in Italy, highlighting some relevant aspects of its contradictory processing in the planning perspective: the traditional exclusion of agricultural areas from the goals of territorial planning; the too sharp distinction between top-down policies and bottom-up practices; the lack of agricultural policy at the local scale, quite completely dependent on the CAP policies. Following this track the paper develops into two parts. In the first one an overview of the slow evoluting relation between planning and agriculture in the Italian planning system is given. This overview shows on one hand how the current separation between agricultural and territorial policies has been reflected in the time at the various levels of government from Region to Municipality; on the other hand it shows how a gradual overcoming of this separation has been experienced with the regional legislation and its related plans, mainly resulting in two levels of regulations: one related to the aspects of farming activities, the other to the protection of landscape and the environment. In the second part the paper focuses on how, due to the lack of suitable solutions coming from regional and local planning, a large number of initiatives were started by diverse actors in autonomous but not always convergent ways. Starting from this evidence, and in order to show the limits and the great potentialities of these various approaches, three peculiar experiences based on the Milan, Turin and Pisa territories are presented. As an eloquent cross-section of the variegated Italian situation, these cases are today facing changes that require clearer choices to integrate food policies and UPA in an overall strategy of urban transition. In the concluding section the authors argue how it is just in the field of governance and inclusiveness that arises the first challenge in Italian context, i.e. to overcome the limits inherent to the tradition of the top down planning system. To this end, it is necessary that also the present distance between the spatial planning and the food planning approaches, which echoes that of the historical opposition between town and countryside, be overcome through appropriate forms of disciplinary interaction and social participation", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1917665587"}}

How might urban agriculture practices be more explicitly designed and managed to contribute to the resilience of urban socio-technical-ecological systems?

Urban agriculture (UA)\u2013the production of food in urban environments\u2013is argued by theorists and practitioners as one way to increase the resilience of cities by reducing vulnerabilities of current food supply systems. The anticipated value of UA in resilient cities contributes in part to a growing field of theory and practice focused on the task of designing and integrating UA into existing urban landscapes.  This thesis reframes UA as a socio-technical-ecological system (STES) in which practitioners\u2013consciously or otherwise\u2013manage resources and relationships to produce ecosystem services. Framing UA in this way informed the selection of four case studies\u2013three in the UK and one in the Netherlands\u2013that seek to generate multiple benefits by creating UA networks across several sites in a city.  Design research methods used in the fieldwork data collection and analysis stages revealed patterns that describe methods of working with UA as a STES that has cycles of growth and collapse. The patterns tested positively for coherence through discussion with urban agriculture practitioners in Melbourne.  A comparison of the case studies and patterns with resilience methods and principles revealed correlations and gaps between the two. Working with social and ecological diversity, embracing experimentation and risk in socio-ecological systems are resilience-building principles that occurred in the case studies. Working at multiple scales and preparing innovative projects in anticipation of disturbance in the STES are resilience-building principles that were not identified in the case studies or patterns.  The scope of the case studies in this thesis was limited to those that worked on multiple sites in a city because the presence of distributed urban agriculture is anticipated to contribute to urban resilience. The thesis found, within these limitations, that there are some correlations between resilience-building principles developed from rural and peri-urban case studies and the UA practices investigated. It also found gaps between the principles and the UA practices. The UA case studies demonstrated some common patterns of practice that were recognisable, if unusual, to UA practitioners in Melbourne. There is some possibility that UA network practices might be more explicitly aligned with resilience-building principles and that patterns might continue to be drawn from them, allowing such methods to be applied in different cities.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2210014875"}}

The overarching context of this research is the problem of sustainability in, or of, existing urban areas. Urban populations are expected to rise in the UK, without a corresponding rate of change to the physical form of cities. This research looks to the expertise of inhabitants in existing urban areas for understandings and practices that could address sustainability and that may complement or obviate physical urban design interventions. It seeks to explore the relationship between locality, local knowledge and broader themes of sustainability. The Abundance urban fruit harvesting project in Sheffield is taken as an example of collective local action by inhabitants in an existing urban area to address themes relevant to sustainability. Abundance participants find, harvest, distribute, map, and celebrate surplus produce, such as fruit, nuts and herbs in the city. Blurring boundaries of what is considered urban, rural, nature, or private, and bringing humans into closer connection with the ecological life of the city, could be said to increase ecological sensitivity. In terms of methodology, this study takes an inductive approach, informed by grounded theory. An ethnography of the Abundance fruit harvesting project in Sheffield is conducted over a full year. The thesis includes thick description that relates the practices involved, the spaces used, and the changed relations produced. This forms the basis for considering how sustainability is understood in the context of \u2018bottom up\u2019 community projects and practices in urban areas, and what implications this raises for \u2018mainstream\u2019 approaches to sustainable development in urban planning and design. As a learning assemblage, Abundance critiques aspects of conventional urbanism and draws together more ecological alternatives.

In particular the key findings are: 1. grassroots collectives can practice a form of urban design that is vernacular and experiential; 2. this type of urban design can play a role that is tactical and critical in processes of urban development and change; 3. participants adopted an eco-centric understanding of sustainability (an assemblage or meshwork of ecological relations) which is rooted in entanglements with living and non-living others; 4. social learning is a way of inhabiting the city, and in this context makes a novel contribution to practice theory; 5. socially engaged arts practice and collective action by urban inhabitants offer routes to activating change in existing urban areas and; 6. the use of ethnographic methods can enhance urban design research.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2422851952"}}

This paper explores a fundament shift in urban agriculture based on a model of productive urban ecologies and cultural practices of foraging. The first part identifies the extent and growth of urban foraging as a significant yet largely unrecognized cultural practice. It summarizes the findings of ethnographic research on urban foraging in Syracuse, NY, as well as a multi\u2010city study conducted by the USDA Forest Service. The result is a typology of urban ecologies and a narrative of the spatial practices of appropriating often marginal spaces of advanced capitalism (vacant lots, brownfields) as well as de\u2010commodified spaces such as parks or rights\u2010of\u2010ways. The second part focuses on design strategies for responding to the challenges and opportunities for urban foraging and productive ecologies. Since foraging is a dynamic and often transgressive practice, crossing boundaries of public/private property, as well as conceptual ones (culture/nature, cultivated/wild) it serves as a provocation for new ways of conceptualizing urban spaces, ecologies, urban agriculture, and design. Case studies and design proposals for Syracuse, NY and New York City provide a set of strategies for re\u2010describing the potential edible ecologies of urban landscapes and intervening in shaping those novel ecologies. It outlines a paradigm shift in design and planning thinking that works with the provisional tactical practices of foraging necessary to shape the emergent nature of new urban ecologies. These productive, edible ecologies integrate urban agriculture with critical landscape systems and re\u2010localize urban metabolism in fundamental ways.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2604702425"}}

The study aimed on addressing urban poverty in context with urban community gardens in the case of Karoi Town Council. The problem statement states that, due to the prevailing situation in Zimbabwe of poor economy and limited employment opportunities, urban residents are now living under poverty conditions, earning below the poverty datum line and enduring with one meal a day. So it is the core of the study to show how urban community gardens can solve such challenges and reduces urban poverty. The research objectives are; to evaluate the effectiveness of urban community gardens in reducing urban poverty, to assess the extent to which urban community gardens meet the demands of household food security, to find out challenges faced by urban community gardens beneficiaries and to identify strategies that can be used to improve the conditions of urban community gardens in Karoi town. The literature review covered several aspects upon community gardens and urban poverty. It highlighted the role of literature review to the study, which is to summarises, evaluates and clarifying the works of the study being carried out. It has also defined urban poverty, urban community gardens and urban agriculture. More so, the literature review explained the nature of poverty in the world and in the Zimbabwean context. The role of Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals to poverty and Agriculture were also explained. Theoretical framework was explained basing on two theories which are Johanne Henry Von Thunen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spatial Land Theory and Cultural and Structural Poverty Theory, which explained urban farming and poverty respectively. For empirical evidence, two case studies were used which are; the case of Masizame community garden in South Africa and Gamakalle garden in Niger. Quantitative and qualitative research design was used. The target population for the study are the beneficiaries of urban community gardens of Karoi and Karoi Town Council employees. The actual population of Karoi is 28 606. The sampling technique were grouped into two, probability and non-probability sampling. For this study, purposive or judgemental sampling was used as non-probability sampling and simple random sampling as probability sampling. The sample size, are 40 community garden beneficiaries and 10 Karoi Town Council employees, which makes the total of 50 sample size. Focus group discussions, interviews and questionnaires are the research instruments used to gather data for the study. The research has found that urban community gardens are playing a pivotal role in addressing urban poverty through, income generation, increasing meals per day after harvesting, nutritional diversity, socio-economic empowerment and employment creation. The research concludes that, urban community gardens are effective in addressing urban poverty, because residents are benefiting from the gardens and their standards of life are being rising. However, although community gardens are effective, the study recommend, the legalising of urban community gardens, inclusion of urban community gardens in planning, improve urban community garden technology, increase extension services coverage and improve market linkages for urban community gardens produce.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2751770792"}}

Urban farming projects often involve the (temporarily) redevelopment of urban space by local co-productions of citizens and/or entrepreneurs. To realize their ambitions these coalitions often need support of public (government) resources such as time, money, space and regulation (Green Deal Stadslandbouw, 2013). This paper asks the question to what extent the development of urban farming projects can be understood as an example of planning through direct citizen participation/ participatory governance (e.g. Cornwall, 2004; Roberts, 2004) and what this means for the role of the municipal planning professional or civil servant in making these projects successful. Literature on the role of the municipal planner or civil servant in urban farming projects mainly concerns the role as enabler of projects given the many difficulties for projects. However, when looked at the development of urban farming as an example of citizen participation/ participatory governance and the transfer of social functions towards society other roles and tasks of planners seem to be important to make urban farming successful. This discussion paper looks to the role of planners and civil servants in some related government domains such as landscape (e.g. Van Dam et al. 2008, 2010, 2011) and neighbourhood development (e.g. Frieling et al., 2014) to complement our understanding of the role of planners in making urban farming projects successful. With this analysis the paper sets the scene for further research into tools for the planning professional or civil servant to support urban farming. In the paper the situation in Amsterdam serves as an example.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2765576932"}}

In the major U.S. and European cities (e.g., Detroit, Seattle, San Francisco, London, Paris, etc.) that since 2007 have been feeling the effects of the international economic crisis, regeneration processes have been set up thanks, among other things, to the synergic impact generated by urban agriculture (UA). There are numerous and greatly varied effects, linked to localization, that are consistent with the paradigm of sustainable development, although the sporadic, spontaneous, and discontinued nature of UA conditions its capacity to strongly influence an entire community. With a view to enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of urban agriculture, and to facilitating its planning, this study puts forward the implementation of an organized and multifunctional agro-urban system. The consent of the population involved is vital for the creation and implementation of the system, therefore ascertaining not only the existence but also the level of social appreciation of this resource is of paramount importance. With the aim of providing a suitable methodology for ascertaining the social appreciation of the stakeholders in the agro-urban system, the paper puts forward a deliberative monetary appraisal that combines an economic valuation based on hypothetic scenarios with direct, inclusive, and dialogic approaches. In this paper we present: (1) a general overview of the main characteristics of urban agriculture and related problems; (2) the principal methodological elements for defining and planning an agro-urban system; and (3) guidelines for a deliberative appraisal procedure related to an agro-urban system.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2080029341"}}

Within the urban area, over the past decades unused land and public land such as streams and road sides have given urban residents a space for farming (urban farms). However, because this use is illegal, farming in unused and public lands could cause conflicts between urban farm users and land owners, degrade the quality of the urban landscape and contaminate the environment. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide a way of legalizing these farming practices that have been cultivated in unused urban areas and public lands. This study analyzed the status of distribution and use of the urban farms that have been scattered around urban areas in many different forms. The survey was conducted through on-the-spot investigation and in-person interviews with farm users and those who were operating weekend farms in the Siji region of Daegu Metropolitan City. According to the results of this study, urban farms were mainly found in green areas that were easily accessible from residential districts and prohibited from development. It was also revealed that the nearer to the border of the residential districts the sites of urban farms were, the larger the number of urban farms was. When it comes to the type of land use, although the proportion of urban farms located in farmlands was very high, the proportion of those located on state-owned lands such as roads, railroads and streams was also high, over 1/3 of that of the former sites. Among the users of urban farms, the percentage of users who were farming private-owned land for free was highest and that of state-owned land without permission ranked second. Most people who were farming unused lands or state-owned lands without permission, such as streams, roads, railroads, were the elderly. This shows the potential of farms in urban area as leisure activities spaces for the elderly. Even though this study has limitations in that the survey target area was selected in a certain area and the sizes of all urban farms were not measured by surveying apparatus and instruments, it helps to determine the characteristics of use and distribution associated with the spaces of urban farming, and to raise the importance and necessity of legalizing urban farms cultivated illegally in public land.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2805642695"}}

In the second part, I argue that by ranking the spatial units that ground the spatial frames of the projects according to the specific public they are aimed at, the most powerful actor makes competitive use of scale frames. This paper thus argues for more attention to the socio-spatial framing of urban agriculture and urban gardening projects.

It is believed that there are diverse social, economic, and environmental benefits to be gained through agriculture in urban areas. The practice of urban agriculture and research on the subject have been around for some time both in Korea and internationally. Analytical reviews of pre-existing research and some examples of urban agriculture have led to the conclusion that it is crucial to secure enough space for farming in order to galvanize the culture of agricultural practice in cities. Although theUrbanAgriculture Promotion and SupportAct came into effect inKorea in 2013, there has been no boost in urban agriculture due to a lack of space.With such an awareness of urban agriculture issues, this research has been carried out to identify the legal and institutional problems facedwhen attempting to secure space for urban agriculture and suggests solutions for such problems.

These broad factors are proximity to water, proximity to residence, access to land, proximity to market, suitable fertile soils, and availability of labour. These factors were subsequently broken down to sixteen categories. Almost all the variables exhibited negatively significant correlations with the index of attractiveness. Urban farmers prefer sites which were closer to water, free with minimal lease and rental cost, and also sites with fertile soil that is closer to farmer's residence, where aggregate costs of production is minimal and labour relatively available.

Populations around the world are growing and becoming predominately urban, fueling the need to re-examine how urban spaces are developed and urban inhabitants are fed. One remedy that is increasingly being considered as a solution to inadequate food access in cities, is urban agriculture. As a practice, urban agriculture is beneficial in both post-industrial and developing cities because it touches on the three pillars of sustainability: economics, society, and the environment. Historically, as well as currently, economic and food security are two of the most common reasons for participation in urban agriculture. Urban agriculture not only provides a source of healthful sustenance that might otherwise be lacking, it can also contribute to a household\u2019s income, offset food expenditures, and create jobs. Social facets are another reason for populations to engage in urban agriculture. A garden or rooftop farm is a place where people come together for mutual benefit, often enhancing the common social and cultural identity for city residents. Larger urban farms also participate in community enrichment through job training and other educational programmes, many of which benefit underserved populations. Finally, urban agriculture can play an important role in the environmental sustainability of a city. As a form of green infrastructure, urban farms and community food gardens help reduce urban heat island effects, mitigate urban stormwater impacts and lower the energy embodied in food transportation. This paper will describe a multi-year study undertaken by the Urban Design Laboratory at the Earth Institute to assess the opportunities and challenges associated with the development of urban agriculture in New York City (NYC). The paper will present metrics on potential growing capacity within the City inclusive of both rooftop and land-based options, results from a survey of New York City based urban farmers that gathered information on the challenges and barriers to food production in NYC, with a focus on rooftop farming, and data from an environmental monitoring study on a commercial rooftop farm in Brooklyn.

AbstractIn the past 20 years, municipal governments across the United States have increasingly tried to incorporate environmental efforts into city business and policies. Urban sustainability has become the key concept around which such activities are organized. Official sustainability plans are most often implemented through indicators and metrics. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, urban gardening, in a variety of forms, has been the focus of ongoing citizen- and NGO-led environmental efforts, as well as municipal measures of sustainability. Here, debates around the recent adoption of a city urban agriculture policy, as well as a program to encourage the installation of raingardens in neighborhoods across the city, reveal some of the rich variations in gardening practices and spaces. These far exceed the relatively narrow official focus on sustainability indicators. Better understanding how urban sustainability initiatives might work with, but also move beyond, indicators may provide directions toward wider visions of sustainable urban life.Keywords: urban sustainabilityurban agriculturegardeningyards AcknowledgmentThe author gratefully acknowledges Helga Leitner for insightful discussion and comments on earlier drafts of this essay.Notes1.

Urban agriculture (UA) has been drawing a lot of attention recently for several reasons: the majority of the world population has shifted from living in rural to urban areas; the environmental impact of agriculture is a matter of rising concern; and food insecurity, especially the accessibility of food, remains a major challenge. UA has often been proposed as a solution to some of these issues, for example by producing food in places where population density is highest, reducing transportation costs, connecting people directly to food systems and using urban areas efficiently. However, to date no study has examined how much food could actually be produced in urban areas at the global scale. Here we use a simple approach, based on different global-scale datasets, to assess to what extent UA is constrained by the existing amount of urban space. Our results suggest that UA would require roughly one third of the total global urban area to meet the global vegetable consumption of urban dwellers. This estimate does not consider how much urban area may actually be suitable and available for UA, which likely varies substantially around the world and according to the type of UA performed. Further, this global average value masks variations of more than two orders of magnitude among individual countries. The variations in the space required across countries derive mostly from variations in urban population density, and much less from variations in yields or per capita consumption. Overall, the space required is regrettably the highest where UA is most needed, i.e., in more food insecure countries. We also show that smaller urban clusters (i.e., <100 km2 each) together represent about two thirds of the global urban extent; thus UA discourse and policies should not focus on large cities exclusively, but should also target smaller urban areas that offer the greatest potential in terms of physical space.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2151091193"}}

Abstract Urban agriculture, a current trend in many US cities, is purported to bring enhanced food security, reduction of food waste, community building, open green space in cities and higher property values. However, the literature lacks an understanding of whether urban farming has extended beyond a compelling concept into the practice of farming in the city and peri-urban areas. The exact definition of an urban farm is challenging, since many urban farms have a primary mission of supporting social goals rather than providing food. Use of the USDA definition of farm omits many self-identified urban farms, but the most consistent measure of agriculture is the Census of Agriculture. Using census data, this paper finds that urban farms are smaller than the typical farm, and while the amount of urban and peri-urban farmland declined between 2002 and 2007, the total number of farms increased. Growth in farmland is positively related to land values, suggesting that increases in urban farmland are more likely to take place in population dense, land scarce areas. Spatial analysis of urban and peri-urban farms in the Northeast finds fewer clusters of farms in areas with high land costs. In the most populous Northeastern cities, the farms are more likely to be located in the peri-urban area than in the urban core. Urban farms in the Northeast were more likely to produce vegetables, eggs and goats. Significant levels of vegetable farm clusters were detected surrounding Providence, Boston and Hartford Metropolitan Statistical Areas, which are regions that had no significant level of clustering of total farms. Future analysis, incorporating data from the 2012 census, should provide insight into whether local policy changes have resulted in growth in urban farms and farmland.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2518004125"}}

Over the past several years, urban agriculture's popularity in California has begun to escalate, with strong emerging interest in San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, San Diego, Los Angeles and other metropolitan communities.

This paper will report on preliminary findings and analyses of the needs assessment, particularly how UC ANR personnel are engaged with UA, and what tools they think would best serve urban farmers.

Peri-urban agriculture is common to cities worldwide. Large cities depend on the availability of fresh foodstuffs and traditionally these have been supplied competitively by small scale farmers located on the fringes of cities. A peri-urban location gives access to urban markets as well as the opportunity to tap into urban water infrastructure and temporarily idle land. These opportunities mean, however, that peri-urban farmers are displaced by urban expansion. This chapter examines these dynamics through a case study of peri-urban agriculture in Sydney, Australia.

This chapter examines the biophysical, socio-economic, environmental and human health dimensions of urban and peri-urban agriculture in Dakar city (Senegal) and identifies structural threats to urban agriculture, including those already induced, or have the potential to be induced, by climate change. Urban agriculture, which provides an important source of fresh vegetables and other fresh products for the city is being increasingly marginalised due to a combination of factors including diminished soil and water quality, increasing temperatures and reduced rainfall, urban encroachment and pollution from industrial sources. A lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities between local and national governments hinders the ability to protect urban agricultural land from urban encroachment and a lack of access to credit by farmers adds to their ability to cope with the multitude of other pressures. Dakar is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean on the northern, western and southern sides with no room for expansion, including any potential expansion of urban agriculture. Ground water in this urban zone is steadily deteriorating due to nitrate pollution of shallow groundwater in soil aquifers combined with increasing saltwater intrusion. Recycling of untreated wastewater for use in urban agriculture, a common practice in Dakar and other cities in Africa has increased the incidence of food-borne contamination. For example, recent microbial sampling of water showed a very high proportion of sites (87 %) with contamination levels above World Health Organisation standards for irrigation without restriction. Solid and liquid waste management is one of the biggest problems Dakar is facing as are many other cities of developing countries. Climate change will further impact urban agriculture. Shortening of cold periods favorable to vegetable cropping in semi-arid areas, increasingly hotter summers, more frequent flooding and drought periods, and higher incidence of pest and diseases are among the potential impacts of climate change. Coastal zones of the city are particularly under threat due to the rising sea level with negative consequences of coastal erosion and salt-water intrusion in lowlands. Projection models show a strong warming trend in the region. Conversely, there is no agreed trend of rainfall prediction at present but deficits are anticipated by general circulation models. Adaptation strategies of farmers include lifting the ground surface with landfill in order to better cope with flooding (specifically for flower cultivation), development of soil and soilless micro gardens in boxes, crop diversification and use of hybrid seeds. Urban agriculture has the potential to contribute to climate change adaptation through reinforcement of urban agricultural systems resilience, water recycling, buffering thermal and hydraulic shocks, providing safe and nutritious food, recycling wastes and conserving biodiversity. Despite its huge potential to reduce poverty and make the city more resilient to impacts from climate change, urban agriculture is not high on the urban planning agenda. Recommendations are formulated towards taking into consideration urban agriculture in national and local planning, strengthening capacities of stakeholders and awareness at all levels of society on the economic, social and environmental role of urban agriculture can play in sustainable development and greening of the city and its economy.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W263416135"}}

With more than half of the worlds population living in urban areas and a great increasing to be expected in the coming decades, we need to develop our approach to planning urban environments. The public space will probably have to be used by a greater concentration of people, and it is therefore necessary to be able to ensure that our public spaces meets people\u2019s demands. In this thesis I want to see if Urban Farming can help to improve the urban life in public areas. An approach is taken to view urban farming from a perspective where the food production is not in focus, but rather how it can create an opportunity for social interaction for people, both participants and observers. This is because, according to my theoretical perspective can promote urban life and the process of social sustainability. Through a study of previous research and literature on the subject can previous experiences of urban farmings social impacts and relation to the public life be distinguished. Three interviews have been conducted, all with different actors related to urban farming, in order to form a picture of how the working with urban farming occurs and own experiences from different levels of the society. In the thesis is also a conceptual design proposal included. The design area is located in Hallonbergen, Sweden. To form an understanding for the public life in the area a survey of the inhabitants assumptions of their neighborhood and analysis have been performed. It is concluded that the inhabitants in Hallonbergen experiences several social problems in their habitat. In relation to experiences from the literature and the expert interviews, it can be concluded that it is highly likely that a urban farming would be to the benefit of social interaction between the tenants. Which according to the theories will improve the urban life in public places. In the process of social sustainability is key factors defined, social equity and community sustainability. The research can conclude that previous experiences and research indicates that urban farming can have a strong impact on these. Conclusions of the thesis hopes to bring a new perspective on the effects from urban farming, where an understanding of the social qualities can be at the center instead of food production.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1191009670"}}

Urban agriculture is promoted as a tool to meet goals of social sustainability. Although urban agriculture as a whole is a large sector of gardening and farming activities within and near urban areas and social sustainability is most affiliated with how the urban environment has been built to foster opportunities to pursue a \u201cgood life\u201d for citizens. This thesis contributes to the application of the community capacity model to evaluate the assets and needs of two case studies: Malmo and Minneapolis to determine how urban agriculture can aid municipalities looking to meet social sustainability goals. The research finds that communities are prohibited or enabled by the programs, policies, and resources provided by the municipality. Therefore, the municipality must take a proactive role in fostering the urban agriculture movement. The ability of the community to capture these resources and address problems is limited by the community\u2019s capacity. Malmo has been less able to invigorate a new paradigm of urban agriculture away from the historically grounded allotment (kolonilotten), whereas Minneapolis has engaged in community gardening for decades and is able to capitalize on that experience to expand it to urban farms in addition to community gardens. This outcome is most apparent when analyzing it through the lens of the goals or \u201cfunction\u201d of the urban agriculture movements of the respective cities. In Malmo the focus is on social sustainability, and therefore the largest benefit is from developing more community gardens. In Minneapolis the goal is to grow the local food movement, and therefore the outcome is the development of larger-scale urban farms. Therefore imparting that the goal or \u201cfunction\u201d must be framed in a way that addresses context specific needs but also does not over-promise outcomes. Community gardens in particular and urban agriculture in general provide an outlet for people to rebuilt a cultural connection to locally produced food as well as connect within the community to those they would otherwise not meet. It therefore is an effective tool to be used to support social sustainability goals as well as to foster a re-newed food culture.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2098858456"}}

The story of agriculture in peri-urban Australia is one of short term intensive farming, regularly relocating in the face of urban demand. Planning solutions implemented by governments to protect productive lands from urban growth have not succeeded, with the result that this area of interface between urban and rural lands has become highly contested and confused. The prevailing view identifies this space as having no firm identity, inevitably transitioning to residential use. This study sought to unpack the peri-urban to establish its identity, using its multiple elements as clues. Investigating contextual forces of population, landscape and food by applying the theoretical lenses of planning, valuation, agriculture and landscape resulted in a conceptualisation of the space as wicked, yet multifunctional and collaborative. Using mixed methods, and recruiting voice as a tool, the study deconstructs the peri-urban landscape, revealing an alternate view of the space which not only captures the contests and wickedness, but potentially finds a new accommodation of them. Pulling the peri-urban apart identified a cacophony of voices, which not only challenges the prevailing view but also reveals that the contestation contributes to a specific peri-urban identity. The research concludes that these spaces are not transitional or temporary, rather their multifunctionality and dynamism give them an identity and integrity in their own right. A critical part of this identity is captured in the idea of a new agrifood market in the space, different in structure from the traditional market, pulling multiple uses and values together. It has an unexpected interface - focused as much on relationships as food production. It is nimble, able to react quickly to consumer demand and its close proximity to urban centres is critical.

The 2011 Swedish FORMAS Report on Urban Sustainable Development identifies a knowledge gap in the relationship between citizen and city. The report maintains that there is an unquestionable link between built environment and living conditions through which urban inhabitants, by acting within and appropriating their surroundings, also become co-creators of the city's fabric. This lack of encompassing citizens\u2019 interpretation, and the communication gap between citizens and experts, calls for alternatives to mainstream urban design processes especially when it comes to urban foodscapes. To encourage more resilient approaches, we must actively engage city dwellers and seek to comprehend their immediate contexts, perceptions, and how they engage with urban green spaces \u2013 in sum, a transfer and democratisation of spatial agency.  This paper sets out the preliminary stages of using some explorative tools in critical cartography to initiate this transfer, thereby creating opportunities for transforming urban food-related lifestyles. Comparative modes of inquiry incorporating the digital and bodily, tool and platform, are explored through active and design-based research as an alternate approach to greening the city and engaging the citizen as agent. These methodologies invite interrogation of what we eat and where our food comes from, while also encouraging a certain intimacy to emerge with the urban landscape and a revaluation of its seasonal rhythms.  Urban CoMapper is a digital tool that explores connections between citizen, built environment and experts though a smartphone interface for community mapping. Its research thematic for locating urban green potential in foodscapes is to investigate the role of food in both the urban landscape and policy-making. Via their devices, participants can effectively contribute to the urban green planning process. Through this approach we can investigate citizens\u2019 links to their immediate environment, exploring their perception of urban conditions to identify creative strategies for engagement and change. In the first phase, the tool charts existing and potential Stockholm sites for urban farming via a real-time comprehensive survey. In the second phase, the body is engaged as interface to explore creative cartographical methods from an organoleptic perspective. This phase presupposes the capacity of such green spaces to stimulate the senses, leading to a heightened awareness of \u2018food behaviours\u2019 that cannot be captured by a digital device. The assumption holds that through an social-ecological lens, these heightened sensorial encounters render inhabitants more emotionally inclined to adjust food-related habits.\u00a0   The transdisciplinary Grona Linjen platform plays a significant role in evaluating such cartographical research and digital tools through a series of events that facilitate bodily contact with the sites. The platform provides a vibrant alliance of artists, architects, landscapers, gardeners, performers, geographers and others to depict urban food in creative and engaging ways. Here, interventions called \u2018safaris\u2019 are staged to foster interest in urban farming, encourage tactile engagement with the neighbourhood fabric, knit together existing farming initiatives, as well as showcase potential sites for further exploration. Participants embark on overland expeditions to discover existing green treasures and potential \u2018acupuncture points\u2019 that could revive community involvement, integration, underutilized spaces, and increase biodiversity.\u00a0  The safaris serve as bodily, cartographical exercises whereby the process of actively engaging with soil, body and stomach takes on an organoleptic dimension. Through eating, growing, and traversing a landscape, sites are \u2018interpreted\u2019 and reciprocally stimulated. The challenge remains whether the interplay between these methods of digital and bodily cartography leads to an emergent space for food as an inclusive medium in sustainable urban design, planning and living.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2785865113"}}

Detroit has become a leader in the urban agriculture movement, so it is an honor to contribute to the symposium that the University of Detroit Mercy Law Review organized on the subject. As both an academic and a citizen, I have followed the expansion of the city's urban food initiatives with both awe and envy. Detroit's residents, both individuals and corporations, are transforming both the physical and cognitive environment of the city.  For example, one source estimates that the city has between 1500 and 2000 gardens, some of which are tended by homeowners in their backyards, and some of which have been developed or supported by local business, including the Cadillac Urban Gardens created by General Motors with 250 re-purposed shipping crates. A local newspaper's website even posted a guide to Detroit's community gardens and urban farms that ran to multiple pages. Numerous organizations and coalitions in the area exist to promote sustainable local agriculture, including Keep Growing Detroit, Detroit Black Community Food Security Network, the Urban Agriculture Department of The Greening of Detroit, and the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative. Public-private coalitions such as FoodPLUS/Detroit also are forming to leverage talent and resources in support of the movement. Detroit's vibrant food scene is a model for the expanding number of communities in the U.S. seeking to improve food access and justice, to reduce carbon footprints, and to improve other measures of sustainability.  My city, Knoxville, Tennessee, is one of those communities. In 2012, Knoxville was one of the top 20 finalists in the Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge, a program that offers substantial financial awards for innovative local solutions to national problems. Knoxville's proposal called for the creation of an \u201curban food corridor\u201d in the city to stimulate \u201ca culture of healthy eating and eliminate food deserts by stimulating connections in the urban food cycle between land, farming jobs, food processing, distribution, sale, and composting.\u201d The proposal was ambitious and sought to mobilize other urban areas that are attempting to organize their own urban agriculture and food systems. Knoxville envisioned the creation of a scalable, self-sustaining, \u201curban land-to-market\u201d food corridor to improve not only food security and health measures in the community, but also to stimulate economic activity in areas of chronic disinvestment.   This article will briefly review the details of Knoxville's innovative proposal and describe the concept of a food corridor. It also will provide an overview of the challenges that the city encountered, and is still confronting, as it pursues its food corridor vision. Finally, it will consider the path forward for Knoxville and other U.S. cities participating in the \u201cquiet revolution\u201d of urban agriculture.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2962793186"}}

Globally the UN Development Program estimates that 800 million people are involved in urban farming worldwide. Of these, 200 million produce food primarily for the market, providing 15 to 20 percent of the world\u2019s food. But the majority raises food for their own families. With the increase in urban poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition in urban areas due to increasing urbanization, many citizens have turned to urban agriculture as a livelihood strategy and source of income for a substantial number of urban households. However, many urban farmers operate without formal recognition of their main livelihood activity and lack the structural support of proper municipal policies and legislation. Contradictions exist between legislation, policy and actual practice. This paper examines legal and policy framework affecting development of urban agriculture. Using Eldoret Municipality case study, purposive sampling was employed and targeted Land Use Policy of 2009, Urban Areas and Cities Act 2011, Physical Planning Act Cap 286, Public Health Act Cap 242, Environment Act, Agriculture Act Cap 318, Local Government Act Cap 265 and Eldoret Municipal Bylaws. Key informant interviews were conducted with top government officials of the Ministries of Lands, Public Health, Local Government, Environment, and Agriculture, Eldoret Municipal Authority and Physical Planning Department. Data was analyzed by reviewing the contents, identifying contradictions between the laws and describing them as correctly as possible in finding out how the existing policies and acts have affected the development of urban agriculture According to the national legislation in Kenya, urban agriculture can be forbidden, restricted, allowed, controlled, facilitated or even promoted as expressed in the various policies and acts.. But there is no specific policy on urban agriculture. Eldoret Municipality recognizes the importance of urban farming as an important livelihood component, by tolerating the practice though it is illegal. But the translation of this awareness into a formal recognition in by-laws and ordinances has not been done. The study recommends that policy on Urban Agriculture should be enacted and the Physical Planning Act Cap 286 revised and municipal by laws harmonized in line with Urban Areas and Cities act 2011, and the New Land Policy(2009) to legalize the activity to enable maximum realization of its benefits and ensure sustainable land use management.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2993989550"}}

Like several other post-industrial cities in America, Buffalo, New York is struggling financially. During these hard times, the number of abandoned buildings and vacant lots in Buffalo has skyrocketed. Politicians and planners alike have battled with trying to use these areas in socially productive ways. The City of Buffalo began with a policy of demolishing empty buildings in an attempt to reduce crime. Buffalo did not have a plan for the lots after it removed the buildings. They are not maintained, and no further development or action is expected. While the new vacant lots may have reduced some safety hazards, they simply moved sites of criminal activity and presented another type of blight in the community. Pockets of unattractive vacant lots signal to outsiders that the neighborhood is a struggling one. Community groups, tired with the city\u2019s inaction, have come together to make these vacant lots productive as they become sites for community gardens and urban agriculture. One of the obstacles in such efforts, however, is a battle over property rights. Community groups want some security in their rights over the land but they are not always interested in becoming landowners. This Article builds on efforts to promote urban agriculture and remove legal and practical obstacles to its development. Specifically, we explore concerns regarding land tenure.

As residents have increasingly moved from urban centers to suburbs, several cities have not been able to create effective solutions to the problems that such population loss has presented. Abandoned properties have proven to be the primary problem, and nowhere is that problem more pronounced than in Detroit. Urban agriculture has been widely embraced on a grassroots level as a potential solution to the pervasive problems that abandoned properties present and that cities have been unable to solve. While urban agriculture networks have largely arisen outside of municipal control, several cities are beginning to recognize urban agriculture as a potential tool for urban revitalization. However, there is a basic problem: many cities in which urban farming has flourished are riddled with brownfields. It is possible for cities and the urban agriculture community to turn this obstacle into an opportunity if they work together. By utilizing the Michigan Brownfield Redevelopment Financing Act to incentivize urban farming, Detroit could not only promote urban agriculture as a cost-effective tool for the revitalization of some of Detroit\u2019s most distressed neighborhoods, but could also ensure that the farmers and the food they produce are safe from toxic contamination.

Abstract In A ustralia, as in other Western countries, peri\u2010urban farmland is increasingly being considered a public good, contributing to urban sustainability and climate change mitigation. To retain local food production, advocates have called for the implementation of farmland protection policies that restrict urban development, such as exclusion zoning. Many such policies have been abandoned due to protests, often from the very people the policies are ostensibly intended to protect \u2013 farmers. Examining the failure of S ydney's latest \u2018green zones\u2019 through a political ecology lens, this paper challenges the prevailing narrative that these protests indicate a lack of community support for the ideal of farmland protection. The failure of the green zones was one of political process, specifically the lack of consultation with S ydney's culturally and linguistically diverse small\u2010scale farmers, rather than community rejection of the principle of protection. Interview responses from farmers suggest that a bottom\u2010up approach to policy\u2010making would have yielded alternative and more successful approaches to maintaining farming on the fringe. This paper concludes that ensuring small\u2010scale farmers have access to and agency in the environmental decision\u2010making process generates options for farmland protection policy that move beyond a housing\u2010versus\u2010farming dichotomy.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2145551401"}}

Pioneering models of productive landscapes and urban agriculture go back to 19 th century with the works of Ebenezer Howard, Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Right, and Ian McHarg. Obviously, cities have been blended with nature for centuries; the only difference now is that industrialization has made food production invisible. Istanbul is presented as the case study.

Citizen Engagement and Municipal Governance in Edmonton's Food and Agriculture Strategy Development. In the mid- to late 1990s, most provincial governments in Canada downloaded or devolved authority for land use planning to local levels of government. In Alberta, this shifted responsibility for the protection of farmland to municipalities. However, a strong oil and gas economy and rapid growth of Alberta's urban centers in recent decades has resulted in significant loss of prime farmland to urban and industrial development. In Edmonton, Alberta's capital city, citizens' concerns over food security and the protection of farmland within city boundaries shaped the 2010 municipal development plan, which links land use planning with food and agriculture, and also paved the way for an Edmonton agri-food strategy. In this exploratory case study we examine factors shaping Edmonton's food policy development and implementation, and the impact on prime farmland in the city's outer limits. Despite progressive changes in policy due to strong citizen support, municipal council's approval of a food and agriculture strategy lacking hard targets subsequently set the stage for continued urban sprawl and loss of prime farmland. This study illuminates the conflicts between citizens' demand for sustainable urban food systems and the development narrative still prevalent in many North American cities.

The practice of agroforestry can be much beneficial in the African communities where there are harsh environmental conditions, low technologies of agricultural production, fragmented land tenure system, unreliable livelihoods and chronic food insecurity. This paper is an outcome of a descriptive survey study that was conducted in Nambale division, Busia County in Kenya, which partly examined the factors influencing adoption of agroforestry practices among rural households. The adoption of agroforestry has not been very successful due to land ownership and land rights aspects that have adversely affected its adoption to the larger extent. In Kenya, land ownership remains exceedingly skewed in many rural parts of the country. The authors argue that when land ownership is extremely unequal, agroforestry activities and its growth delivers fewer paybacks for the poor rural households. Land tenure problems have been exacerbated by continuous fragmentation of land, land inheritance, gender imbalance in land ownership and the rights to land use. The paper concludes that the decision to adopt agroforestry was partly influenced by land and tree tenure, size of land and gender equity (women's rights to property and recognition of co-ownership). Additionally, rural households' investments in agroforestry increase with increasing in land tenure. The important policy recommendation made is that laws affecting adoption of agroforestry practices should be updated and harmonized in-order to achieve the 10% tree cover and for farmers and households to achieve the maximum benefits of agroforestry.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1726304894"}}

Despite the fact that urban farming is widespread in many African cities there is not yet a clearly defined view on how to deal with these activities in urban planning and management. On the basis of field interviews in the rapidly expanding metropolitan area of Kampala (Uganda) three different urban farming types were identified: subsistence farming, garden farming and commercial farming. These three urban farming types have their own spatial organisation logic and each interact in a specific way with urban expansion. In this paper the possible outcome of three alternative urban management strategies for Kampala (urban sprawl, urban infilling and a combination of both) were translated into spatially explicit land use scenarios for the years 2020 and 2030. This allowed to evaluate the spatial impact of each scenario on the future viability of the different urban farming practices. Urban sprawl fragments large open spaces thereby reducing the space for subsistence farming with 80% by 2030. Urban infilling, on the other hand, decreases the opportunities for small to medium scale garden and commercial farming by a possible reduction of 62% of the available farming land by 2030. The results of the analysis are useful for urban planners as they give insight in the potential future effects of proposed planning strategies on urban farming.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2097036834"}}

Across the nineteenth century, municipal ordinances to remove farm animals from city limits set the tone for the planning profession, aligning it with the field of public health in creating a hygienic city. In the efforts to untangle animal agriculture from waste management, public space, and urban food supply, urban authorities employed some of the first land-use regulations in the United States, shaping new planning powers. Ordinances banning slaughterhouses, piggeries, and dairies culminated with zoning as planning became a profession. These regulations ultimately allowed planners to transform cities and their food environments by dismantling a system in which animals and their caretakers among the urban poor had played integral parts in food production, processing, and municipal waste management.

Many of the urban agricultural projects in the United States have emerged from social movements and nonprofit organizations focused on urban renewal, education, job training, community development, and sustainability initiatives. Although these social initiatives have traction, critical knowledge gaps exist regarding the science of food production in urban ecosystems.

On a closer approach to the system of open spaces of the city, we were confronted with the existence of typologically qualified spaces and of spaces without any typological attribution but that are, by no means, less important than the former. Open spaces, interstices between the built fabric of the contemporary city, that present a certain continuity and that allow the flow of air, of water and matter, simultaneously with the flow of residents or casual users.

A HISTORY OF DIFFERENTIAL TAX SUPPORT TO PRESERVE AGRICULTURE IN THE UNITED STATED IV. APPLYING THE LESSONS FROM THE PERI-URBAN FRINGE TO CITIES: FROM THE WILLIAMSON ACT TO AB 551 CONCLUSION INTRODUCTION On February 20, 2013, California State Assemblyman Phil Ting introduced Assembly Bill (AB) 551. If passed, this bill would create incentives for owners of undeveloped property in urban residential areas to lease their land for agricultural use or the creation of urban green space, or both. (1) Much like the California Land Conservation of 1965, AB 551 will allow local governments to provide tax relief for small urban farms. Whereas the intent of the California Land Conservation of 1965 (commonly known as the Act) was to protect California's rural agricultural land from urban development, (2) AB 551 could be a Williamson Act for cities, enabling local governments to encourage commercial agriculture where urban development is infeasible or has otherwise stalled. In this Note, I explore how states, and in particular California, can help promote the creation of thriving agricultural sectors within cities. I first consider the benefits that come from urban agriculture, be they social, economic or environmental. I then discuss legal barriers that have all but rendered urban agriculture economically infeasible in California. Next, I review the history of differential tax programs employed to protect agriculture on the peri-urban fringe, to draw an analogy to that which could help foster agriculture within cities' limits. In the last Part, I explain the rationale that led to the proposal of AB 551, and how the application of a differential tax program, like the Act, but tailored to cities, can help spawn a new agricultural sector within cosmopolitan California. I. THE BENEFITS DERIVED FROM URBAN AGRICULTURE Urban agriculture in its various forms can provide an abundance of benefits to a city, including nutrition and job creation, not to mention increased home value and public safety. (3) By reducing the supply of vacant, unproductive urban land, agriculture can provide relief from blight and raise surrounding property values. (4) It can improve the public image of troubled neighborhoods and supply low-income residents with healthier and more nutritious food. (5) From an aesthetic and ecological viewpoint, urban agriculture increases the amount of neighborhood green space, reduces the need for food transportation through greater availability of local produce, and supports local and regional food systems in general. Lastly, in terms of community development, urban agriculture helps instill pride and self-sufficiency among inner-city residents who grow food for themselves and others. (6) It can create jobs and revitalize the poorest neighborhoods by creating food-based employment (particularly for young people), thus bringing greater income to residents, useful job related skills and knowledge, and improving the overall quality of health and well being. And it can provide new, non-traditional program activities for community-based nonprofit organizations and educational opportunities for schools and their surrounding communities. For all these reasons, over the past decade, urban agriculture has garnered significant interest across the country, in cities like Detroit, Salt Lake City, Baltimore, Austin, and San Francisco, citizens, organizations, and planners are working with legislators to craft laws and policies to promote the growth and sustainability of agriculture within city limits. (7) Yet, despite strong citizen and political support, in California, a complex web of local government laws, zoning ordinances, and property tax codes continue to prevent urban agriculture from evolving much beyond community gardens. \u2026", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2343368072"}}

The year 2007 marked a critical event in the world history. For the first time, more than half of the world population now lives in cities. In many developing countries, the urbanization process goes along with increasing urban poverty and polluted environment, growing food insecurity and malnutrition, especially for children, pregnant and lactating women; and increasing unemployment. Urban agriculture represents an opportunity for improving food supply, health conditions, local economy, social integration, and environmental sustainability altogether. Urban agriculture is present throughout the world in a diversity of farming systems. Urban dwellers ranging 25\u201330 % are involved worldwide in the agro-food sector. Urban agriculture will gain in recognition for its benefits and services because urban population and rural\u2013urban migration are increasing. The actual scarcity of knowledge on urban agriculture has somehow hindered the relevance of this activity. Here, we review the social, cultural, technical, economic, environmental, and political factors affecting urban agriculture with examples taken in East Asia, South America, or East Africa. We discuss the definition, benefits, and limitations of urban agriculture. Food security benefit of urban agriculture is evidenced by 100\u2013200 million urban farmers worldwide providing the city markets with fresh horticultural goods. Urban agriculture favors social improvement since the poors spend up to 85 % of their income in food purchase and most urban farmers belong to poorest populations. Sociologically urban farming favors both social inclusion and reduction of gender inequalities, as 65 % of urban farmers are women. Urban agriculture has ecological benefits by reducing the city waste, improving urban biodiversity and air quality, and overall reducing the environmental impact related to both food transport and storage. The production of horticultural goods shows the main benefits of urban agriculture. Fruit and vegetable crops give high yields, up to 50 kg m\u22122 year\u22121, a more efficient use of agricultural inputs, high added value, and rapidly perishable products that can easily substitute the rural production in the local market. Urban horticulture is the most competitive branch of urban farming due to the high cost of urban land and with the need of high water- and fertilizer-use efficiency.

Two main questions are addressed in this paper, namely: to what extent can urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) contribute to the social inclusion of migrants? And does UPA practised by urban farmers of foreign origin contribute to the expansion of biodiversity in cities? A comparative analysis of current peri-urban agriculture practices in Lisbon and London was carried out in allotment gardens and other spaces far from the centre in and on the edges of these capital cities. In both cases, a significant proportion of the migrant population is involved in two different frameworks: regulated in London and non-regulated in Lisbon. The paper concludes that patterns of social inclusion are quite city specific: urban farming communities from the Cape Verde islands maintain and strengthen community bonds through their activity but this does not necessary lead to better social integration within the wider Portuguese society. In London, migrants of foreign origin become part of an integrated communitarism on an individual basis. Concerning the contribution of peri-urban agriculture to biodiversity, evidence gathered strongly suggests that urban farmers of foreign origin do contribute to broadening biodiversity primarily in Lisbon and to a lesser extent in London. Final observations note to what extent these urban practices contribute to the Right to the City and thus if they are, more broadly, of an emancipatory and transformative nature.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2131880294"}}

Communities in these settings share characteristics with rural areas, in terms of continued connections with agriculture, yet with an increasing reliance of non-agricultural employment which poses challenges for policy and planning shaped by dichotomous configurations of space. This study focuses on maize producers in the Toluca Metropolitan Area, west of Mexico City, which is a traditional maize production region that also has exhibited high rates of industrial and residential growth over the last thirty years. We utilize household surveys from three peri-urban communities to create livelihood cluster groups that tease out the value and role of maize production amongst urban growth. The results show that maize plays various roles for households, including an insurance strategy against volatile job markets and for preference in making homemade tortillas. Rural and urban livelihoods in this region are mutually dependent on each other and not necessarily reflecting a linear rural\u2013urban transition, which could lead to the persistence of maize production in the future.

Urban agriculture in South Africa historically has been labeled as an illegal activity. The problems caused by this labeling have been compounded by the traditional planning system in South Africa, which does not recognize urban agriculture as a part of the land use in the urban landscape. Despite its illegality, however, current evidence shows that it is commonly practiced by many poor households in developing countries. There is growing evidence that most countries are gradually recognizing the value of urban agriculture to poor households, and to this end they are beginning to realize the importance of incorporating it into their urban policy packages.Despite this recognition and acceptance of urban agriculture as a livelihood and food-security strategy among the urban poor, little attention is paid to it. This paper explores urban agriculture as one of the survival strategies among the urban poor in Durban's KwaMashu residential area. The focus is on the nature of urban agriculture and the competing challenges associated with it. At the core of some of the challenges are existing legislation and policies that seem to be unresponsive to urban agriculture. Despite this unresponsive legislation, we show that urban agriculture continues to flourish along sensitive areas such as river banks and on road right-of-ways.

In a world that is increasingly urban, AFNs at a local scale can be more easily developed by linking peri-urban farmlands and cities. However, agriculture in the rural\u2013urban fringe struggles to survive in the face of urban pressures and sprawl; a process which undermines viable agricultural production in the city's countryside.

Consequently, food production became severely dislocated and, in the post-conflict era, the state of the agricultural sector has become a major concern to governmental and non-governmental development agencies.

African pastoralists and pastoral culture is a core part of Africa\u2019s culture, history and heritage. The livestock and natural resource management practices used by pastoralists require well organized collective action, especially in the harsh environments in which they live. Pastoralists organize themselves to split herds and move animals to distant grazing areas, to control access to communal grazing areas, to manage the watering of livestock, and to provide security. Partly for these reasons, pastoralists have very strong social organizations and leadership. The Policy Framework for Pastoralism in Africa arises from the need for a continent-wide platform to effectively address, in a holistic manner, the many challenges confronting pastoral communities. The framework defined the guidelines, principles and modalities for combining all the essential elements needed for a better understanding of pastoral issues, and for the development and implementation of interventions to address these issues. While facilitating engagement with regional and country-level planning processes, the policy framework can play a catalytic role in promoting development in pastoral communities by providing the African platform tool for harnessing the economic and technical resources needed to empower pastoral communities to better manage their resources, for their own long-term benefit.

Urban and peri-urban vegetable production and marketing systems have the potential to contribute to poverty reduction, food and nutritional security, local economic and community development, social inclusion of marginalized groups, as well as to enhance urban environmental management by increasing biodiversity. There are some major challenges for the production of vegetables in the developing world: On the one hand constraints due to heavily competing and conflicting interests in land which endanger existing production sites and on the other hand climate variability and climate change, which contribute to frequent flooding, prolonged droughts and temperature extremes. However, very often the complexity of urban and peri-urban vegetable systems is not fully understood by regional and urban planners, local authorities, researchers and communities. Its potential for sustainable development of urban and peri-urban areas in developing countries thus has only been utilized to a limited extent. GISbased community food mapping of urban and peri-urban areas as part of an interactive collaborative research environment is an appropriate, innovative tool enabling researchers, policy makers and the public to find information on a range of factors that affect access to healthy, affordable food, and thus can address the above-mentioned constraints.

A B ST R A C T One of the major problems confronting cities and towns of the third world countries today is that of population explosion leading to uncontrolled urban growth. This, aside the fact that it leads to the conversion of agricultural land into other uses (residential especially), also affects negatively, the general well-being of the urban dwellers as well as the environment as a result of rural-urban migration. It was on this basis that this paper set out to assess the impact of the expansion of Minna, along the Minna-Bida road on agricultural land. In order to effectively achieve this, both the primary and secondary sources of data collection were employed. The primary data was obtained through the administration of 60 questionnaires on the natives of the communities under study, while the secondary data was obtained from sources like internet materials and journals. The result of the study revealed that the quantity of farm produce being evacuated from the communities to Minna has been on steady decline owing to the selling of agricultural land by the natives. The result also confirmed that the development activities now taking place in the study areas are not guided by any policy guideline (as a result of the obsoleteness of the Minna master plan), thus the haphazard development of the communities. Owing to this therefore, the paper recommended that there should be a paradigm shift in physical planning, where all stakeholders would deliberate and find solutions to the problems confronting the communities in terms of their agricultural and socio-economic activities. It was also recommended that government should show more commitment to the economic, physical and social development of people through the review of the Minna.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2188032548"}}

In this paper we present the recent history of urban farms in Lisbon and we identify the instruments that have been employed to control and incorporate them into urban planning. The existence of urban farms in the city of Lisbon is present throughout its history. Since 2009 there is an action of the Lisbon Municipal Council (C\u00e2mara Municipal de Lisboa - CML) to create new horticultural parks, or sets of urban farms integrated in defined areas. Such initiatives of the CML come as a response to the precarious conditions and disorganization of the existing urban farms. The need to regularize the urban agriculture and stimulate it, are in the origin of a set of infrastructures to support citizens in Lisbon, as in many other cities. Once this activity the urban agriculture arises, mainly spontaneously and in precarious conditions, driven by economic needs, it takes place in expectant voids or in spaces between the road or rail infrastructure. Through a literature review, we intend to, on one side, determine the features and benefits of urban agriculture, particularly urban farms in the city of Lisbon, and on the other, list the reasons that might justify the promotion of urban agriculture projects and implementation of urban farms. As a conclusion, we can anticipate that the food supply and financial income for citizens can be recognized as benefits of farming in urban areas, among other social, environmental, economic and emotional benefits, which are the reason why state authorities are interested in their regulation and formalization. We also recognize that it is still early to judge the efficiency of public policies to reshape and promote urban farms in Lisbon. However, it can be indicated that the policies that have been applied are top-down, despite the fact that the necessity and feasibility of farms in urban territory are realities identified by the population itself.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2292241367"}}

Due to increasing population, migration and urbanization, demand for urban land uses is obviously outstripping supply leading to highly conflicting land uses in the urban areas. Consequently, there are lopsided land allocations by urban planners to residential, commercial and industrial uses leaving many uses especially in the informal sector uncatered for. Thus, urban crop farming which is a variant of urban agriculture is considered an illegal land use without land being provided for it. This paper advocates that urban crop farming be validly recognized by policy makers in order to enhance its contribution to sustainable urban land management. Seven farming communities in the metropolis where urban crop farming is thriving well were purposely selected while simple random sampling was subsequently used to select respondents in farming communities and structured questionnaires administered to them. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics to answer the various research questions while regression analysis was used to investigate the research hypothesis. The study established that most of the lands used by urban crop farmers are owned by public authorities (65.8%), private organizations (23.9%) and individuals (7.2%). Respondents therefore largely gained access to land through squatting or land grabbing (60.1%) and renting (28.7%).

Trends across all projects were first analyzed according to a traditional sustainability framework, finding that Cleveland\u2018s urban agriculture scored well environmentally, poorly economically, and mixed socially. However, the traditional sustainability framework oversimplified or excluded some important components of what it means to be sustainable, which is why the use of a more holistic sustainable development framework that heightens the importance of justice (equitable distribution of resources) and democracy (inclusive, grassroots procedures) was also used. These measures prove to be far more important to urban agriculture participants, who contest traditional sustainability metrics and recast the goals of their projects in terms of food justice and community empowerment.

The paper presents a wide range of images, contexts and issues related to contemporary forms of urban\u2013rural interface. The urban and rural environments come in contact in various ways, generating patterns with hybrid identities which can be read both on a regional scale (in those cases where cities merge to form megapolitan conurbations), on an urban scale (suburbs of the cities), on a settlement scale (city quarters, farmyards and farmsteads), and even with regards to single buildings. This creates manifold diversified configurations of interface spaces, showing seemingly opposite trends. This work focuses on these bidirectional trends, which are discussed by means of a selection of different concepts, images, projects and experiences, within the international context. On the one hand, an increasing number of projects insert what is commonly associated with the idea of countryside into the cities: urban agriculture, mainly located in periurban open spaces, but in some cases even within the built system through various forms of integration with the building envelope, in line with a growing sensitivity about the need to conceive ways of virtuous relationship between food production, consumption and environment. On the other hand, town planning in many cases \u201cejects\u201d the spaces for business and leisure, locating shopping malls, entertainment and (agri)tourism centres within the countryside. Moreover, typical rural spaces and activities (farms, farm holidays, wine farms, etc.) often refer to urban styles, due to poor design attention, or rather to marketing strategies aimed at enhancing the farm image. Thus, settlements located in rural areas show markedly increasing urban characteristics, with regards to their built environment, open spaces, and outdoor furniture. Whilst many scholars and designers have focused on reinterpreting the agricultural functions when these are inserted in urban architecture and built areas, further interdisciplinary work is needed to analyse how urban functions can be brought into the countryside and improve the quality of rural settlements.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2022755134"}}

Focusing on salmon heads and salmon, this paper examines not only how food becomes waste, but also on the issue of how waste becomes food. Specifically, we analyse the geographical processes through which salmon heads are valued as foodstuffs in some places but waste in others. We argue further that these valuations extend beyond the place of one market to encompass an assembled geography of markets. Further, we suggest that by tracing out the geographies of salmon heads and salmon \u2013 and the markets where each can be found \u2013 we can better articulate where as well as how it is that waste can become food. Ultimately, we argue that questions of food and waste are not just questions of materiality, but questions of the ways in which the material intersects relations of place, place-making and geography.

This paper focuses on urban agriculture as one of the major components of CPUL (Continuous Productive Urban Landscape). CPUL CITY concept can make urban space more productive for the city and more desirable for its citizens and describes our vision for an urban future based on the planful physical, social and managerial introduction of continuous productive urban landscapes (CPUL) including urban agriculture into existing and emerging cities.. The goal is to improve qualities of life. The CPUL City concept proposes that urban agriculture can contribute to more sustainable and resilient food systems while also adding beneficially to the spatial quality of the urban realm. It is an environmental design strategy and provides a strategic framework for the theoretical and practical exploration of ways to implement such landscapes within contemporary urban design. Designing a CPUL means to create a qualitative urban landscape which, above all, thrieves to incorporate the growing of local and organic food. A systemic approach needs to be taken to integrate the physical CPUL / CPUL space into existing or new to establish local managerial systems, i.e. a stakeholder network and/or waste recycling and/or a water system. The CPUL City concept recognises that each city and each site will present a unique set of conditions and competing pressures informing the final shape and extent of its productive landscapes. Today, the CPUL City concept is complimented by other urban design concepts for integrating urban agriculture into contemporary Western cities. Often these start from an interest different to CPUL and result in a different set of proposals, but all have began to explore the design possibilities of growing food within the urban realm. Finally the paper concludes that, while urban agriculture is receiving a great deal of attention, the theory underpinning the design of productive landscapes and the rationale for developing policy to support its practice will require sophisticated cross-disciplinary work to articulate the full potential of concepts such as CPUL in making essential infrastructure within future sustainable cities. Concepts like Continuous Productive Urban Landscape (CPUL) and CPUL City provide design strategies capable of giving spatial and organisational coherence to the infrastructural and qualitative aspects of urban agriculture. The paper documents the growing interest in productive landscape and the CPUL concept within the fields of architecture and urbanism. To translate this interest into practice will require further cross-disciplinary work. The design, planning, landscape, horticultural and retail professions will need to relearn old and develop new skills to support, in particular, the practice of urban agriculture. If urban agriculture is to be widely adopted, its functions, in addition to environmental sustainability, such as providing urban ornament, require articulation. If the economic and social infrastructure can be put in place to support it, we could build something far more abundant and significant than that envisaged by a romantic notion of \u201cgrowing your own\u201d.

To reach the ultimate goal of sustainable cities in Australia, we need to explore all aspects of how urban landscapes function, what is required to sustain these landscapes into the future, what resources are needed to sustain cities and what wastes are created. The role of urban agriculture can be seen as pivotal to reaching these sustainable goals. This research paper examines how urban fringe agriculture can contribute to a sustainable city, environmentally, economically and socially. The research investigated how other countries are utilising urban planning to include agriculture into their cities. It explored the opportunities and constraints of urban agriculture that exist in urban and regional planning of our capital cities.  The missing link in the literature on urban agriculture is the application in urban and regional planning of tools that assist urban agriculture. The research findings show that for urban agriculture to reach its full sustainable potential it needs to be recognized in urban planning. The research project implemented a regional planning model that involved the creation of small city farms positioned to take advantage of the proximity to employment, consumers and recycled water. The model acknowledges the important role local food can play in building communities, removing discrimination and providing food security for the poor and disadvantaged of Australian cities while providing more food options for urban residents.  As part of the research, the proposed model was applied to Western Sydney\u2019s growth centre precinct of Austral to highlight how the proposed model would not adversely affect the critical supply of housing. The success of the model is measured by the calculation of area of agricultural land which is retained for urban agriculture into the future.  This practical implementation of the proposed planning model can be an example of how agriculture can be integrated into any new urban growth area across Australia. The practical creation of urban agriculture on the fringes of our cities can be seen as a large step forward to reaching the sustainable goals set by the city planning guidelines.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1567577856"}}

The aim of this study is to be able to understand the problems within the urban agriculture policy promoted by the Government and local autonomous entity base on the comparison of the consciousness of the urban agriculture between urban farmers and public officials and to inquire into the further revitalization scheme in the end. For this purpose, this study drew implications through studying latest trend and the legislation of domestic and foreign urban agriculture and then conducted a questionnaire survey of urban farmers and public officials. Because of this research, the revitalization schemes of urban agriculture are as follows: First, it's necessary to secure the usable arable land, such as the green roof, community garden, as well as urban agriculture park, etc. Second, it is necessary to establish the urban agriculture relations act suited for the actual circumstances of our country and to back up the legislation at an institutional, technological level in terms of a nation in order to secure the durability of urban agriculture. Third, it is advisable to make a proposal about the problems in time of activities for cultivation by forming a network between urban farmers and public officials and to prepare the plan for the active exchange of farming technologies. Fourth, it's necessary to activate the community gardens by supplying the education through cultivation method & its management method, and a variety of urban-agriculture-participation programs. Fifth, it is necessary to set up the specialized and practical education through an institute for landscape architecture. Sixth, it is necessary to induce the spontaneous participation in urban agriculture from urban farmers accompanied by the activities for promotion that are worth arousing urban farmers' interest. Lastly, it is also necessary to establish a legal basis of urban agricultural parks and facilities as well as to promote a search for multilateral policies and their practice so that the further urban agriculture can be stably continued within city boundaries.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2059768050"}}

A method to understand farmer\u2019s strategies. Even if European and French policies aim at reducing agricultural land consumption for urban development, the equivalent of one French department area is built each seven years. The implementation of French land use planning policies is supposed to integrate the cooperation of agriculture professionals, as a governance form of public intervention. Considering this, we assume that there are some learning failures in the cultural integration between politics and agricultural sectors which may explain some misinterpretations of farming systems issues. In this paper, we expose a method to unravel farming systems dynamics in the context of urban sprawl, as understanding this means integrating on one hand the complexity of agricultural working systems, on the other hand the complexity of the different impacts of urban sprawl on these systems. With this aim in view, we present a new way to study farmers\u2019 strategies. Our approach is based on an analysis of farmers\u2019 decisions, coupled with their motivations. We identified five action levers and four distinct farmers\u2019 rationales with regard to land management decisions, and also their interdependencies. This method could also be used to study other types of farming systems\u2019 structural changes. 1. Urban sprawl and farmers land rationales: an analytical framework Urban sprawl on farmland is one of the global challenges for agriculture nowadays, as it concerns food, amenities and environmental issues. Periurban farmland is expansively constructed every year. In France, 61 000 hectares were artificialized each year from 1992 to 2003. It increased to 86 000 ha between 2006 and 2009, which represent a loss of 73 750 ha of farmland (cultivated and permanent grass surfaces) each year (Agreste, 2010). More than just weighing consumed agricultural areas, this phenomenon is a structural change for agricultural periurban territories and farms immediate environment. Furthermore, urban sprawl induces an increase of land rent in the prospect of land transition towards building use. Consequently the functioning of land market mutates, and thus the renting, purchasing and selling owners strategies (Cavailhes and Wavresky, 2002). In general the access to producing land becomes too elusive for farmers. This sum of constraints hangs over the farming system management. We suppose that they also change the decisions a farmer takes for his farming system. The literature about decision-making in farming system sets a comprehensive approach in the eighties with the simultaneous contribution of management science (works based on Cyert and March, 1963) and anthropology (Barlett, 1980). Renowned French authors have contributed to the formulation of a decision theory (Petit, 1981; Capillon and Manichon, 1988; Landais and al, 1988; Sebillotte and Soler, 1990; Brossier and al. 1991). Since then, most of researches are normative (Lemery, 2005, makes an exception, establishing a rationale comprehensive classification). According to Buchanan, (2010), it wills to \u201cextract and combine theories, tools and methods from several disciplines in order to present a holistic approach to measure resilience, often combined with the aim to provide a framework with which useful and sustainable development policies can be created and implemented\u201d. Researchers establish some decisional models in order to set decisional aid adapted to several mutations in the agricultural context (policies, water resources regulation, climate change), or to determine potential internal level indicators of each farm in terms notably of resilience, adaptability and flexibility coping with these phenomenon (Darnhofer et al., 2008). However, a recent literature of comprehensive researches on farmer\u2019s land rationales in periurban areas exists, notably in France in economics (Jouve and Napoleone, 2003), agronomy (Alavoine-Mornas and Giraud, 2004; Jarrige, 2004) and sociology (Vianey, 2005). But it implies that practices would depend on the farmer strategy and objectives, as exposed in the decision theory of eighties. Indeed, the analysis is based on an a posteriori realignment of land management strategy, adapted from the result observations of land practices: declining, increasing, or stagnation of the cultivated area. In sociology (Souchard, 2010) and geography (Vianey, 2005) studies are more comprehensive however it doesn\u2019t replace the analysis in the organization of farming system. We believe that these methods omit the fact that farmers react in a periurban context to a series of heavy constraints, including access to land. That why the purposes are not always successful. Evaluating this strategy (taking in account how constraints influence the decisions), only on the base of the practices results (that is to say, the evolution of their land plot system) thus seems to be reconsidered. This article presents another method, applied in three French periurban areas in farmers\u2019 land rationales comprehensive analysis. The method is inspired by different works of the place of land in farm management (Bryant, 1976; Morardet, 1992; Gueringer, 2008, 2009). The procedure appears more realistic and effective to understand precisely the farmers\u2019 decision drivers, as they can\u2019t take decisions due to several constraints. Therefore we distinguish \u201cis\u201d and \u201ccould be\u201d and focus our study on the second item, in order to translate accurately what urban sprawl perturbs in agricultural activities. Obviously this work requires an important qualitative research. Land rationales are different forms taken by land farm management. It results from a complex combination between the decision drivers and the action levers panel the farmer has in hand. The decisions drivers\u2019 are internal factors \u2013 which are resulting from the characteristics of the farm and the farmer \u2013, and external factors produced by the context. These three elements have many interactions (Figure n\u00b01). This can be revealed by the farmer\u2019s discourse through an explanation of the past decisions during a given period. It requires asking him to give also for each decision, its justifications. Of course this way of information gathering could be criticized, because the farmer can give a kind of an a posteriori logic to his decision. Some first interviews permit to determine a frame of external factors, internal factors and action levers. In the case of our research, we distinguished four types of external factors, nine types of internal factors (Figure n\u00b02), and five action levers. These last ones are Agricultural practices, Management of land in producing perspectives, Property holdings management, Social relations, and Institutional or political positioning. 2. Sample, interviews and analysis We performed a detailed survey with farmers in urban and suburban areas of the Rhone-Alpes region in France, near Lyon, in the conurbations of Saint-Etienne, Vienne and Voiron (95 municipalities). A particular area was chosen in each city, depending on the diversity of agricultural production systems, urban sprawl and the part of artificial surfaces, including the presence of various development projects (business parks, highway...). Eight homogenous municipalities in terms of urban pressure and growth rate of urban space have been invested (Figure n\u00b03). When the interviews were made, each of the three studied areas was subjected to important urban projects. In the observed municipalities in the conurbation of Saint-Etienne, a highway was scheduled for over twenty years. It didn\u2019t concern more than two or three farms, since a tunnel was planned. People were not convinced about the achievement of the project because of the \u2013 long \u2013 political debate and the needed public budget.

In addition to poor urban planning, there is a fundamentally flawed system in the manner in which social housing is conceived, designed, produced, inhabited and devalued in Mexico. These factors create a cycle of decay and dysfunction of which abandoned housing becomes one of the many spatial consequences. The goal of the thesis project was to come up with a strategic proposal and interventions which can provide counter or alternative proposals to the current situation of decay and allow for a socio-economic platform to develop from within the community.

In post-conflict societies, cities often experience drastic change in settlement and land-use patterns that transform human-environment relationships. These changes include internal displacement, often to urban areas, and environmental degradation. In many African cities, these patterns and relationships are being shaped by urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA), a production system that ensured food security for thousands of rural migrants seeking relative safety in urban areas. In a post-conflict scenario, UPA continues to provide food security and employment in an environment struggling to physically and emotionally recover. Methodologies using a geographical information system (GIS) for urban ecosystem assessment (UEA) are gaining currency among researchers, planners and practitioners to improve understandings and find solutions for sustainable urban development.

Abstract With rapidly deteriorating national and local economies, many urban dwellers in sub-Saharan Africa are resorting to informal sector activities to ameliorate the current food insecurity that poor households face. Among these activities is urban agriculture, which is used both as a source of basic foodstuffs and also for income generation. In many cities, the growing of food crops is considered as an activity for rural areas, and is therefore, excluded from urban development and planning policy. This state of affairs has traditionally presented major challenges for many small-scale urban farmers to realise their full potential and attain household food security. In recent years, changes in climatic conditions (e.g. drought and flooding), coupled with a lack of policies supporting the activities of the urban poor, have combined to make it difficult for households to adapt to the changing urban environment. Drawing upon recent field-based research in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, the paper explores the relationships between urban livelihoods and extreme weather events, and evaluates the extent to which changes in climate and urban governance are impacting upon urban agriculture. The paper has wider relevance in the context of evolving strategies for achieving sustainable urban development, poverty reduction and food security in Africa and elsewhere. Keywords: Climate changeUrban agricultureUrban livelihoodsInstitutionsLusakaAfrica Notes * The term climate change, in the context of this paper, refers to the incidence of extreme weather events that are becoming increasingly common and\u2019 affecting the urban poor in Lusaka, Zambia. Interview conducted by Danny Simatele with a female resident in Chilenje, Lusaka, Zambia, 20 July 2009. All known residential areas housing low and middle income households in Lusaka were listed and grouped into three categories namely: peri-urban areas, high density and medium density areas. Three boxes were labelled with each box bearing one of the categories. A lottery was then conducted resulting in Seven Miles, Garden Compound and Chilenje being picked and included in the study. These are small sub-divisions within the community and each Zone is made of 12 households. Each Zone chooses a Zone leader who represents them at the WDC level. Thus, Zone leaders make up the WDC. The WDC is chaired by an elected Zone leader who represents the whole community at the Municipal level.

Planning and food production in the peri-urban space. A recent British Council project highlighted the important role that local food production can play in addressing climate change. But is our planning system capable supporting strategies to encourage small scale and community food production, especially in the potentially productive peri-urban fringes of our towns and cities?  \u2018Transition Towns\u2019 such as Totnes, Marsden and Slaithwaite have been at the forefront of a movement, now joined by bigger cities such as Hull, that highlights sustainable living and local food production. These modern pioneers of local food production have to operate within the confines of a planning system set up in 1947 and which at that time had mass food production and protection of the countryside as guiding principles. Its policy and regulatory framework may not therefore be best suited to present demands.  The legal and policy context of peri-urban space, especially with its designations of green belt and settlement boundaries, is designed to restrict development, with very few exceptions to this rule being allowed. Yet it is this very space that offers significant potential for aspiring communities to produce food locally. Whilst the planning system might support the broad move towards local production of food and other goods there is an in-built complexity in policy and law that might slow or even halt the efforts of Transition Towns and others in their drive towards a more sustainable lifestyle.  The planning system that emerged at the end of World War II did a number of important things in and around the question of food production. First, it exempted itself from having to deal with \u2018agriculture\u2019. The definition it used to define \u2018agriculture\u2019 is quite specific and this has impacted on the degree of freedom from the planning system that can be exercised. Issues such as intensification, ancillary activities, food processing and \u2018farm\u2019 shops further increase the complexity of interpreting the law at this level. The second impact of the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act is that it adopted a zoning approach that placed land either \u2018in\u2019 or \u2018out\u2019 of a particular classification. The result was a rigid urban-rural demarcation that saw development being constrained to one side only. This now poses serious questions about the nature and form of any \u2018development\u2019 that might take place in support of local food production on the rural side of this boundary.  Our paper explores the nature of planning and agriculture in the peri-urban space and reflects upon the development of law and policy in this area since 1947. We set these against today\u2019s requirements for local food production and we find that the system as set out just after World War II has become over complex through piecemeal interpretation and incremental policy initiatives. In short it is not fit the purpose of local food production. If local food production is, a priori, a good cause, then to be able to respond effectively and helpfully to its requirements the planning profession needs to rethink some of the principles that lay behind decisions made in 1947 and decide to what extent and how best this good cause can be accommodated whilst balancing other competing demands on land at the edge of towns and cities.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W93782666"}}

Since soils are generally fertile and water readily available solar access to ground level becomes an indicator of productivity. Using the subtraction method and satellite photography from Auckland council GIS viewer, potentially productive land is estimated in three residential blocks-Mt Eden, Sandrigham and New Lynn. Based on the results the food energy potential of each site is determined. Preliminary results indicate that low density New Lynn has the highest potential for sustainability with surplus food energy.

Some of these initiatives start and evolve within marginal/liminal urban spaces while others are seeking a more systematic dialogue with local institutions.

For architects and planners, the question of how to design and build must now be weighed against conditions in which finite global resources will play an ever greater role. If we are to create an equitable and sustainable future, new dwelling models must be sought. The scale and complexity of the task demands a broadening of the architectural and planning discourse to embrace fields not traditionally considered relevant.

It prescribes that, by the end of 2012, 20% of the food served in schools must be cooked from organic products.

In the 1950s, Detroiters had apparently achieved the American dream, but when the industrial system started to collapse, the city rapidly followed. For many years local administrators have tried to revive the past glory, until the 2008 crisis made clear that that path is closed. Urban gardens started to appear in the last decade as a grassroots response to the urban decay, spurred by the lack of access to fresh food that makes Detroit one of the largest urban food deserts in the US. In the last five years the phenomenon has caught the eyes of the media, and recently the local government has started to recognise it. According to local sources, the number of gardens is steadily growing. Five structures that call themselves farms are now operating in Detroit, along with more than 300 community gardens. Until recently, institutional support for these activities has been limited. Some institutional actors are now investing in the sector. Wayne State University sponsors a farmers market and lets the students grow gardens on campus; the Eastern Market Corporation started an experimental farm on its campus; the City planning department is working on a plan that would permit commercial farming within the city boundaries. Moore\u2019s work on sustainable cities could help frame what\u2019s happening in Detroit. I argue that urban farmers in Detroit follow a story line that describes the future of Detroit as a city of gardens.

One of the most powerful drivers of global change is urbanisation and the complex interactions of urban areas with their physical environment. With this in mind, in 2005 the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research established a research programme on Future Megacities. One of these research projects, Urban Agriculture Casablanca (UAC), investigates to what extent urban agriculture can make a relevant contribution to the design of a sustainable city. This project seeks to include the provision of open space within integrated and sustainable urban growth in the emerging megacity Casablanca, Morocco. The conceptualisation of urban agriculture is a strategy that could offer a way to integrate green productive infrastructures (GPI) to food planning. The spatial system is to be understood as a working and living environment for a portion of the urban population, meaning that urban farmers become spatial producers of open space and, at the same time, of a new urban milieu \u2013 the rurban. The specific structure of megacities and the discussion about resource-efficient and climate-optimised urban development also raises the issue of how urban-rural linkages within an urban region should be dealt with and what positive interactions between the city and agriculture there might be. These urban-rural linkages have the potential to create improved livelihoods in combination with spatial integration: to develop climate-optimised, multifunctional spatial systems. Megacity dynamics require the linking of top-down and bottom-up strategies, as well as the development of tailor-made solutions.

This is also true of the built environment, which is largely silent of architects\u2019 voices, filled instead by the hubbub of residents daily intervention. This chapter explores one intervention \u2013 community food-gardening \u2013 as it is presently emerging within six inner London housing estates. The estate residents explicitly expressed frustration at the \u2018blank\u2019, \u2018bleak\u2019, \u2018disused\u2019, \u2018neglected\u2019, \u2018barren\u2019, \u2018grey\u2019 and \u2018derelict\u2019 \u2018blankscapes\u2019 surrounding their homes, voicing a desire to re-use them \u2018productively\u2019 through food-gardening. However, this chapter argues that while food is enunciated as the principle agenda, it is a set of related practices, such as the construction of the self-built landscape, the creation of shared social narratives, and the interaction with natural resources that dominate. Using multi-site participant observation, semi-structured interviews and photography, the research throws new light into this overshadowed everyday food-gardening activity that often falls within the penumbra of the productive, economic and environmental \u2018feeding cities\u2019 UA discourse. Rather, what needs to be explored is the re-linking of residents to architecture, landscape, and the planning of cities via food gardening. As one resident put it, gardeners are \u2018amateur architects\u2019, augmenting the pre-planned architecture with a bricolage of seasonal, quotidian, and playful performances. This challenges formal architectural discourse through soil-based interventions, user modification of space, and social harvesting.

Urbanization and the globalization of the food system are causing social, environmental, economic and political problems worldwide. Malaysian urban agriculture is one tool for sustainable development that has the potential to provide food or related services within or on the edges of urban areas. Urban population depends largely on cash income to access food and with unemployment increasing more urban households is unable to access food to meet their needs. Alternative ways of accessing food has become necessary. The goal of this research was to determine the current situation and the future potential of urban agriculture. A literature review was used to determine the perceptions of relevant stakeholders, barriers and ways to overcome those barriers. Study participants demonstrated a relatively greater awareness of environmental and community benefits of urban agriculture compared to food security, health or economic benefits. This study has investigated the impact of such farming on household\u2019s food security and income generation. This result in lack of adequate land use planning for urban agriculture and weak support to urban farmers. Malaysian urban agriculture is therefore constrained by lack of integrated development approach. Major challenges identified were perceptions of limited space, limited resources and education. Recommendations to address these challenges are also provided.

Since the Industrial Revolution, livestock has been driven out of urban and semi-urban areas in the United States. Recently, calls for localizing the food system have led to a rise in urban agriculture, and livestock is finding its way back into the city. The return of livestock to urban areas is rife with tensions, including concerns about public health and challenges to dominant perspectives about the separation of urban from rural life. Through an analysis of municipal codes, this paper identifies how some communities have navigated challenges associated with welcoming livestock back into the city. Specifically, the paper analyzes how codes regulate livestock through prohibitions of certain types of animals, zoning to establish where in the municipality livestock can be kept, site-level restrictions that define property characteristics required to keep productive animals, and requirements for managing livestock and their accessory structures on the property. The analysis demonstrates that no two municipalities approach the urban livestock question in the same way; however, each seeks to place limits on raising livestock in urban areas through some combination of regulatory land use tools. The paper concludes with a broader discussion of how the regulations address key tensions associated with our understanding of the urban-rural divide and competing claims on public health.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2022343789"}}

The dwindling resources from the artisanal sector which provide employment for about 5.8% of the populaces and also supply more than 81.9% of the total domestic fish production is augmented by aquaculture which is the fastest growing production system in the world. Rural-Urban migration which is rapidly increasing has increased the pressure on the urban facilities. Expanding cities affect the areas surrounding the city by altering the natural resource base, converting land to new uses, changing labour patterns, challenging the environment, concentrating urban waste pollution and diminishing natural resource based livelihoods.

In this issue, \u201cPlanners Coming to the Table,\u201d we focus on how the planning community has come in recent years to embrace food systems as a legitimate focus of their profession. This is a watershed event, since planners are trained to provide systematic analyses and process skills to opportunities and challenges faced by communities \u2014 things all too often lacking in agriculture and food system work.Back in 1986 when I was a graduate student in the department of city and regional planning, with a focus on food systems and a minor in extension education, at Cornell University, I was a bit of an odd duck, talking in graduate seminars about food policy councils, how the city of Knoxville was retrofitting buses and changing their routes to accommodate inner-city grocery shoppers, and how farmers\u2019 markets were really functioning as rural microenterprise incubators. My advisor, Pierre Clavel, the recently retired professor and author of Progressive Cities (1986) and Activists in City Hall (2010), humored my interests and encouraged me to passionately pursue food system planning. I wasn\u2019t the only planning student interested in food and agriculture, but at that time we were few and far between.Today the situation is quite different. The American Planning Association has adopted a \u201cPolicy Guide on Community and Regional Food Planning,\u201d planning students are pressing their departments to offer food system planning courses, and Cornell and many other planning programs around North America have begun to accommodate them: hiring faculty with food systems expertise, developing new courses, PhD programs, research groups, and the like (e.g., efforts at the University of Buffalo and the University of Wisconsin). In this issue you will read about the pedagogical roots of this nascent field of planning and get a glimpse into cutting-edge practices.We dedicate this issue to Jerome Kaufman and the intrepid young planners he has helped to inspire, some of whom are pictured on the cover of this issue (see the cover photos\u2019 captions at the top of the table of contents). They have challenged the conventional wisdom in the planning profession and successfully argued that food systems uniquely bridge well established planning fields such as community and economic development, land use, and transportation. While food system planners are really just at the beginning of this exciting period of growth, they have added their shoulders to the wheel, and as a result we will see an accelerated pace in the movement to create more equitable and sustainable food systems. For this, we take our collective hat off to you!In this first issue of our second volume, papers cover a broad swath of the nascent food system planning field \u2014 from pedagogy to practice. Minaker and co-authors and Freedgood and co-authors provide a thorough review of the approaches and tools used by planners and allied professionals to assess community-level food systems. Mendes and Nasr (with multiple contributors, including Jerome Kaufman) and Soma and Wakefield explore the emerging roles (opportunities and challenges) of planning faculty and practicing planners. Evans-Cowley and Desjardins and colleagues provide detailed case studies of incorporating food systems into regional comprehensive planning. One of the powerful analytical tools planners can bring to the table is geographic information systems. Giombolini et al., Ruelle et al., Nixon and Doud, and Hu et al., use spatial analysis to explore the potential for diversification, foodshed development, food security infrastructure, and spatial characteristics of food deserts. Horst et al., Day-Farnsworth and Morales, and Levkoe and Wakefield make explicit cases for planner engagement in alternative value chains, food distribution systems such as urban food hubs (for which they propose a new typology), and community food centers.Our open call papers in this issue include Burnett et al.\u2019s consumer preference study, which suggests that a more narrow definition of \u201clocal\u201d may not increase price premiums significantly. McCuistion et al. studied cattle morbidity in a niche beef cooperative and make management recommendations to minimize losses and costs. Jackson et al. provide a case study of the unique health insurance rebate program managed by a CSA coalition in Wisconsin. Finally, Adekunle et al. explore ethnic vegetable demand in Toronto and the prospects for farm diversification in response to that demand.We also offer two superlative book reviews: Eliav Bitan reviews Fred Kirschenmann\u2019s latest collection of essays entitled Cultivating an Ecological Conscience, and Nevin Cohen reviews de la Salle and Holland\u2019s Agricultural Urbanism: Handbook for Building Sustainable Food Systems in 21st Century Cities \u2014 calling it a \u201cmanifesto\u201d about building place around food.Lastly, our regular columnists offer their views on hot topics related to food system planning and current affairs. Rami Zurayk writes about the absurdities of the current global food regime and the need for it to be \u201coccupied.\u201d Ken Meter gives us 17 reasons to conduct food system assessments and challenges us to think deeper than numbers alone.

Dinner goers found seats in the living room, basement, or yard to eat and mingle, while other folks took containers of food home to their families. The dinners started as a way for Rajendran to support her family after leaving an abusive relationship. In turn, the community that formed around her dinners allowed her to support local farmers, showcase local musicians, and provide made-from-scratch, home-cooked meals for those who might not otherwise be able to afford them. Though she sourced most ingredients locally, Rajendran has also been known to haul suitcases of spices from India. She often used the dinners as fundraisers to support such diverse projects as purchasing fruit trees for the Carrboro Community Garden and providing relief funds for the victims of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. In these and a myriad of other ways, Rajendran's dinners created a space for people to meet over a common table (or couch, or picnic blanket), make friends, support the livelihoods of others in their region, and imagine how, on any given Wednesday morning while peeling garlic, they could also positively impact global communities. Encouraged by people's enthusiasm for her cooking, Rajendran started a catering business and in summer 2010 opened a restaurant, Vimala's Curry-blossom Cafe. She strives to maintain her sustainable and community-friendly practices through these newer ventures. These photos were taken over the course of several weeks between January 2010 and March 17, 2010, the date of her final community dinner. She hopes to continue the dinners in some form now that her restaurant has opened. If you get a chance to eat at either, make sure to snag a cardamom brownie.

One thing that underlies life today is that change is unstoppable. From a management perspective, it's better to envision what the future might look like so your business is best placed to take advantage of the opportunities and to deal with challenges that might arise. In this article, Cilla Delacey takes her crystal ball to envision what domestic and community gardens, and how they are irrigated, might look like in twenty years time.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2243843598"}}

This thesis examines the latent potential of Chicago's former Union Stock Yard, which consequentially draws attention to the polarities of industrial food production. The Union Stock Yard was once symbolic of an era where urban progress was equated with efficiency and growth. Today, the site is facing an identity crisis: it is characterized predominantly by underutilized warehousing, however, innovative closed-loop food producers (such as The Plant and the Iron Street Farm) are indicative of an emerging narrative that focuses on sustainability, health, and taste. This thesis offers a design proposal for a new food technologies cluster that includes multifunctional programmatic components for: research, production, and marketing (as well as new residential communities.) The goal is to formulate a design solution that selectively packages existing elements (river, warehouses, workforce) with new buildings, infrastructure, and public spaces - to build a flexible urban network that will reconnect to the larger square-mile Chicago grid. To do so the study draws upon original analytical studies and numerous precedents that convert decommissioned industrial land. The design product will provide reflection upon the past as it presents a scenario for the future.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1522887653"}}

The agricultural sector is receiving a great deal of attention for topics of general interest as the security, multifunctional activities, alternative uses of crops in food/feed/fuel, reduction in GHG (Green House Gas) emission, LCA (Life Cycle Assessment). The EU policies are directed to implement sustainable local agro-food systems, and the AFSC (agro-fuel supply chain) represent the central issue in planning agricultural commodities to be used for fuel production performed in a space-time dimension. In this paper it is presented a methodology of regional planning the AFSC supported by empirical evidences in the region FVG (Friuli Venezia Giulia). The reference crop is the Mais largely cultivated in this region and now used to satisfy food-feedstock-fuel demands. A composite d-base information system is used to simulate the AFSC to predict the consequences of food policies and suggest measures for the RDP (Regional Development Plan).With the integration of agronomic and economic disciplines it is possible to develop a strategy of regional planning for a sustainable production of bio-fuel.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1579978638"}}

Since the mid-20th century, many United States post-industrial cities have experienced a dramatic loss of population, community resources, and economic growth while their metropolitan areas have continued to grow. These decaying cities are characterized by a high level of crime, substance abuse, unemployment, poverty, food insecurity, vacant land parcels, and urban blight. Many communities rely on urban agriculture (UA) as a mode to achieve not only food security and sustainability, but also community resilience, vacant land remediation, and neighborhood development. While valuable, UA has been treated as a temporary and informal land use. Land tenure conflict often causes the untimely demise of many UA projects. In terms of urban design, UA projects in many cities have been developed as a \u201cpatchwork\u201d without a physical connectivity to other gardens, open spaces, community infrastructure, and other built environment components.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2189224228"}}
