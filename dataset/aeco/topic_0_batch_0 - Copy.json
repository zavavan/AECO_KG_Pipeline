The energy consumption of office buildings has increased sharply since the 21st century with the increasing urbanization coverage. At this stage, the energy consumption of office buildings in China mainly comes from air conditioning and lighting. This paper obtains the regression equation of natural lighting illumination and radiant heat gain under different curtain conditions through experiments and simulations, and gives the theoretical calculation process of curtain regulation of office thermal and light environment and energy consumption. DeST and Ecotect software were used to analyze the thermal and light environment and energy consumption of the office. The results show that setting curtains in the room can effectively improve the indoor thermal light environment, the higher the transmittance of curtains the lower the lighting energy consumption, the higher the number of high temperature hours of natural room temperature and the greater the radiant heat gain. The room with thick curtains has the lowest energy consumption for air conditioning in summer, followed by the room with thin curtains, and the room without curtains has the highest energy consumption for air conditioning. The room without curtains has the lowest energy consumption for artificial lighting, the room with thin curtains has the second lowest, and the room with thick curtains has the highest electricity consumption for artificial lighting. The air conditioning energy consumption accounts for the main building energy consumption, followed by the lighting energy consumption. After setting curtains in the office, the air conditioning energy consumption caused by the solar radiation heat entering the room through the exterior windows is smaller than the lighting energy consumption caused by artificial lighting. Therefore, the installation of internal shading with moderate transmittance and good thermal insulation performance can make the energy saving of lighting and air conditioning energy consumption reach the optimal value.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4362700003"}}

To study the seasonal variations of thermal adaptation, the thermal comfort experiments were conducted on two groups of participants. Each groups included 20 participants who had indoor history mainly with natural ventilation (NV group) and air-conditioning (AC group), respectively. The results demonstrated that the thermal sensation vote (TSV) in warm environments did not differ between AC and NV subjects in summer.

Green roofs are typically constructed for their provision of both environmental and associated economic benefits including increased habitat, thermal regulation, mitigation of air and noise pollution, and stormwater retention. The provision of these various ecosystem services is sharply influenced by plant species composition, with particular species and traits known to excel at specific services. For this reason, increased biodiversity can improve the overall provision of ecosystem services. However, one key contributor to green roof biodiversity, colonizing species, is understudied. In this study we examine the contribution of common colonizing species (lawn weeds) and one green roof species, to three important ecosystem services: stormwater retention, temperature reduction, and nitrogen retention. This experiment used replicated green roof modules to examine 13 different treatments: eight colonizing species in monoculture, one green roof species monoculture, two treatments with a mix of colonizing species, one treatment where vegetation was allowed to spontaneously colonize, and one substrate only control. Results from this study show that mixtures of colonizing species performed well for all three monitored ecosystem services, with a few of the monocultures, especially those with high biomass or canopy density, performing similarly. While it is unlikely that green roof installations would proceed equally well without adding vegetation, our results indicate that colonizing species can support a viable green roof ecosystem. This study shows that spontaneous growth and/or allowing new species to colonize may be a viable design alternative for green roofs, decreasing cost while maintaining the desired ecosystem services.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4389010058"}}

Computer simulations were performed for photosensors with three ranges of viewing angles in two daylit perimeter zones of the office and consecutive computational processes based on dimming control algorithm were employed for final light output of lighting fixtures. Three CIE standard sky and blind conditions were employed for the prediction of indoor daylight illuminance, photosensor illuminance, and daylight glare probability (DGP). The results indicate that the perceived glare can be imperceptible for the majority of time periods and a daylight dimming control system can be effectively applied for perimeter zones of office with curtain walls. For the south-facing zone under clear and intermediate sky conditions, the horizontal and 45 degree blind conditions are recommended to be combined with the full or partial photosensor shielding conditions for desirable dimming control performances. The unshielded photosensor condition should be generally avoided. For the east-facing zone under clear and intermediate sky, the photosensor sensing range should be narrowed using full shielding for the improvement of system performance of daylight dimming control. The unshielded and partially-shielded photosensors are rarely recommended.

Municipal District 6 (MD-6) is an oldest and the most populous areas of Tehran city in Tehran province-Iran, which also has a high building density. In order to reduce the calculation error, this area is divided into 23 sections. And modeling in each section is done by comparing closely related sections separately. The results of this study can be generalized to all same parts of the world. Initially, earth surface temperature is estimated using Landsat 8 satellite data. Then, the vegetation area of each section is calculated using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). And in the next step, by establishing a relationship between the obtained data, the rate of reduction of UHI is determined by adding a certain area of vegetation. Also, a map was prepared that showing the buildings on UHI, thus measuring the area of roofs with the ability to add vegetation. Finally, the modeling is based on this information. Results show with the addition of vegetation to the roofs of buildings, an average of % 38.58 of the area and 0.68\u02daC of the intensity of the UHI was reduced in this area.

A combination of methods is employed, utilizing the gray-box method for input data collection and the white-box method for sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of proposed interventions on building envelope individually and in combination. The building's energy consumption reveals that the combined impact of the passive strategies results in an approximately 82% reduction in gas consumption and a 2% reduction in electric consumption. Sensitivity analysis underscores the necessity of hourly investigations, introducing a research dimension to the study. Hourly assessments expose side effects that hinder the rate of improvement in the envelope retrofitting scenario. Statistical analysis of consumer parameters highlights the significance of the cooling system's hourly consumption, particularly in mitigating undesirable effects during shoulder seasons.

Vertical towers exacerbate the issue, as lower-level lighting affects higher-level occupants, and more research is needed to understand the vertical dispersion of light and its impact on sleep disturbance. This work offers a simple mathematical model for height dependence of illuminance in an urban building. It correlates basic measurements to reduce the values of the Exponent (n) and Linear (Coeff2) coefficients in a standard power-law curve. The collection of only a few data points can help to investigate the extent of the lighting spread at various floors of the building. Even with the complex lighting environment in Hong Kong, the methodology is exercised in 8 sample buildings from 4 different neighbourhoods to show the insights from the testing results. The heights of the studied buildings range from 3 to 18 stories, and they are for residential and mixed use. While the average measured illuminance at the street level was between 37 lx and 303 lx for the 4 neighbourhoods, the average illuminance across building heights was 14 lx to 247 lx. The existence of multiple light sources on building facades disrupts the simple inverse-square relationship with a single light source. The power n values range from approximately -1.7 to -0.8, while the Coeff2 values range from 61 to 7603 for the measured buildings.

Our goal is to highlight findings about the co-benefits of nature-based solutions on buildings in real-life case studies.

To effectively mitigate the escalating thermal environment challenges arising during large cities\u2019 developmental planning, rigorously examining the spatial interdependencies between the built-up environment and the SUHI phenomenon is imperative. Employing Beijing's primary urban area as a case study, this research addresses the gap in the systematic analysis of spatial correlations between the built-up environment and SUHI within the urban heat island effect research domain. The study leverages Landsat-8 satellite data spanning 2016\u20132020, Sentinel-2 land-use classification data, and 2020 digital elevation model (DEM) data, integrating them with geospatial data processing techniques to probe the multifaceted associations between the built-up environment and SUHI in a 1 \u00d7 1-km grid-based local-scale model. This investigation is distinguished by developing a Comprehensive Built-up Environment System Index, synthesized through multisource data and multidimensional methodologies. The study culminates in the following key findings: (1) Between 2016 and 2020, Beijing's primary urban area manifested an ascending spiral trend in the SUHI effect, with the heat island morphology exhibiting nonuniformity across the four seasons. (2) In the historical summer heat island scenarios of Beijing's primary urban area, the architectural and roadway environments demonstrated a consistently positive correlation with the SUHI effect. (3) Excluding the average number of floors parameter, all remaining urban built-up environment parameters exhibited a significant association with SUHI fluctuations.Practical ApplicationsThis research provides valuable insights on the following aspects for urban planners, policymakers, and practitioners addressing the surface urban heat island effect in Beijing's main urban area. (1) Urban heat island mitigation: Influential urban parameters, like building density, road connectivity coefficient, and green space, significantly impact surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensity. Targeted strategies, such as increasing green spaces and implementing cool roofs, can mitigate the SUHI effect and improve urban thermal comfort.

Moreover, smart lighting, which involves simulations considering factors affecting the lighting environment and the use of presence detection and sensor technologies, has been studied.

Considering the exposure conditions of the facades, risks of damages, such as mold development, may be avoided by an assertive evaluation and selection among different types of paints. In this context, this paper experimentally determined essential properties related to the hygrothermal behavior of painted mortars and simulated their resulting performance when applied on exposed facades in three Brazilian cities in distinct bioclimatic zones. Hygrothermal simulations were carried out using the software WUFI Pro 6.6. Six different types of paints were studied, among which satin acrylic paint (SAP) led to the lowest water vapor permeability and matte polyvinyl acetate (PVA), silicate (SIL), lime (LP), and hydrated lime with white glue (HLG) paints led to the highest. Matte acrylic paint (MAP), PVA, SIL, LP, and HLG had similar impacts on the vapor transmission of mortar renderings.

The main models for assessing thermal comfort, like predictive mean vote (PMV) and adaptive models, need many environmental measurements, making monitoring complex. That has sparked a debate: some advocate reducing the number of variables, while others stress sticking to the original models. This article evaluates current research trends and addresses the limitations of globe sensors, the most commonly used instrument for measuring mean radiant temperature. To address these issues, the study conducts a sensitivity analysis using latin hypercube sampling with multidimensional uniformity and employs data from 41 measurements conducted in educational buildings spanning different academic levels, from preschool to university.

Using numerically validated dynamic thermal model that incorporates realistic local hourly weather data, this work for the first time quantifies the effect of introduction of PCM in combination with active ventilation inside the roof slab on the time-shifting and damping of thermal energy ingress into buildings for a typical city with hot and dry climate in Western India. We explored parameters such as the phase-change temperature, ventilation rate and relative mass of the PCM to understand the effect of these design interventions on energy ingress and temperatures.

The hygrothermal behavior of a building is important because it directly influences indoor comfort levels and energy consumption. Hence, effective strategies must be implemented to minimize energy consumption while optimizing indoor conditions. This study analyzed indoor hygrothermal environments and energy consumption in scenarios related to passive and active building elements, such as exterior walls and indoor control temperature. A simulation considering hygrothermal behavior in walls and spaces was utilized, and the accuracy of the model was validated via an on-site test. Here, cross-laminated timber (CLT) walls, which have been proposed for their energy-saving potential, were substituted for conventional concrete walls. The application of CLT walls enhances indoor comfort better than concrete walls. Despite using the same CLT material, different wall layer compositions lead to internal moisture accumulation. Hence, it was determined that appropriate wall layer compositions should be selected based on regional climate conditions. Furthermore, although indoor comfort was ensured by varying indoor control temperatures, the energy consumption of the heating and cooling systems increased by up to 81 %. Despite the application of passive elements, an indoor heating temperature of 24 \u00b0C achieves an optimal balance between comfort and energy consumption. This temperature ensured a satisfactory indoor comfort level and facilitated a manageable increase in energy consumption. In summary, this study provides nuanced insights into the hygrothermal dynamics of buildings, emphasizing the demand for strategic materials, considering regional climates, and carefully managing indoor temperatures to strike an effective balance between comfort and energy efficiency.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391042983"}}

Building fresh air supply needs to meet certain regulations and fit people's ever-growing indoor air quality demand. However, fresh air handling requires huge energy consumption that goes against the goal of net-zero energy buildings. Thus, in this work, an adaptive fresh air pre-handling system is designed to reduce the cooling and heating loads of HVAC system. The sky-facing surface of the system uses electrochromic mechanism to manipulate the optical properties and thus make full use of solar energy (solar heating) and deep space cold source (radiative cooling) by switching between heating and cooling modes. In the cooling mode, the sky-facing surface shows a transmittance of down to zero, while the reflectance is high at 0.89 on average. In the heating mode, the electrochromic glass is highly transparent, allowing the sunlight to reach the solar heat absorber. To obtain the energy-saving potential under different climates, six cities were selected from various climate regions in China. Results show that the adaptive fresh air pre-handling system can be effective in up to 55.4% time of a year. The maximum energy-saving ratios for medium office, warehouse, and single-family house can reach up to 11.52%, 26.62%, and 18.29%, respectively.

Furthermore, the effects of the region (heating methods), building types and payment patterns on the thermal responses were clarified. Finally, the thermal neutral temperatures and 80 % thermal acceptable ranges were determined. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the indoor thermal environments and human thermal responses in different types of buildings during winter (P < 0.00). However, the effect size of the thermal responses (d \u2265 0.3) is lower than that of the environmental parameters (d \u2265 0.7).

They are stricter in the requirements for room temperature and weaker in thermal adaptability. Nevertheless, the southerners can actively adapt to lower indoor temperatures by clothing adjustments, with a wider acceptable range of indoor temperatures and lower thermal neutral temperatures.

School outdoor spaces are important for students as they impact learning outcomes, physical and mental health, social interaction, and overall well-being. In hot, arid climates, the use of outdoor spaces becomes a challenge. The high levels of thermal stress impact outdoor thermal comfort during the warmer months, leading to limited or no use of those spaces. This paper assesses vegetation as a passive cooling strategy for an elementary public school in the city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Air temperature (Ta), mean radiant temperature (Tmrt), and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) are used to investigate outdoor thermal comfort. The experimental approach adopted in this study compares a base model against eight scenarios, which simulate different vegetation (grass, shrubs, two trees at two different heights, 5-10m) and spacing between them (3.5m and 7m). The data is simulated using Envi-Met 5.5 and assessed for their impact on thermal stress levels for the school outdoor space. The results found that by applying trees 10m high with 3.5m spacing between them and using evergreen type leaves, Ta was reduced between (1.4-3.2)\u00b0C reaching max reduction in August, Tmrt (7.13-64.73)\u00b0C where max reduction was recorded in October, and UTCI at (3.00-17.95)\u00b0C in April.

This means that energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with buildings should be reduced to zero through energy efficiency measures and renewable energy integration. The main pathways towards an EU decarbonized building stock have been designed under the Energy Performance of Building Directive (EPBD). Although at the EU policy-making level, things are constantly developing and preparing the next steps towards the 2050 decarbonized building sector objective, there is still much ongoing research and debate related to the implementation of energy efficiency measures, particularly in eastern European countries. This study assesses the influence of building shape and wall insulation thickness on the overall heat transfer of a building and its impact on the annual heating demand. Energy efficiency in buildings is crucial for sustainable and cost-effective operatcoffions, and understanding the factors affecting heat losses is essential for optimizing energy consumption. Three distinct buildings with different A/V (Area to Volume) ratios were investigated, each representing varying architectural designs. Additionally, multiple thermal insulation thicknesses were considered for the walls, ranging from conventional to advanced thickness. The results of this study reaffirm that the A/V ratio plays an important role in a building's energy performance. Higher compactness leads to reduced heating demand, which is particularly an energy efficient design measure that has no costs. The A/V ratio should be prioritized during the design phase of a building.

Due to their relatively low economic and technological level and unique life style, rural houses retrofits bear more uncertainties in construction and occupant behavior. However, these uncertainties for rural house retrofits have not yet been fully investigated, since previous studies have focused mostly on residential buildings or office buildings in urban areas. Therefore, to obtain more targeted and reliable analysis, a methodology that integrates the uncertainties of the construction structure, envelope retrofit construction and occupant behavior is proposed for rural house retrofits. First, the uncertain inputs are quantified through two global sensitivity analysis methods (SRC and TGP). Then, Pareto front solutions of envelope retrofit construction and occupant behavior are obtained for each typical structure through multiobjective optimization. Furthermore, the entropy weight method is used to analyze the Pareto front solutions, based on which the optimization objectives for different structures of rural houses are analyzed, and the optimal solutions are found. The methodology is applied to a case study of Jiaxian, which is a typical underdeveloped rural area in the hot-summer and cold-winter zone of China. The results of the global sensitivity analysis reveal that the three most sensitive factors affect approximately 80% to 98% of the uncertain outputs (discomfort hours and total energy consumption).

In recent years, the urgency to address climate challenges has driven the need to achieve net-zero carbon goals by 2050. The construction industry, as a major contributor to carbon emissions, plays a vital role in achieving this target. While numerous net-zero energy building approaches have been proposed globally, there is limited comparative research between developed and developing countries. This study aims to address this research gap by selecting the top three carbon-emitting countries in the world - China, India, and the United States (US) - as the research subjects. Through a comparison of their net-zero energy building approaches and typical cases, it is evident that there exists a significant disparity between developed and developing nations. Specifically, differences are observed in the following aspects: net-zero building approaches in the United States have an earlier start and involve collaborations between the government and multiple organizations, while China and India started relatively later and rely primarily on government initiatives. China's consideration of applicable building types in net-zero approaches is not inclusive enough, particularly lacking coverage on industrial buildings. It is encouraging to observe that China and India pay more attention to embodied carbon emissions compared, while their decarbonization strategies for embodied carbon emissions are not as comprehensive as those in the United States when it comes to actual building applications. Regarding carbon offset options, the United States and India demonstrate more comprehensive considerations, while China currently lacks consideration for off-site power generation and negative carbon technologies. The United States boasts a larger number of net-zero buildings, most of which have been certified through the country's own net-zero building approaches. In contrast, China and India have fewer certified net-zero buildings, and only a small percentage have been certified using their own methods, especially in China. The technologies employed in zero\u2011carbon buildings in the United States are more advanced compared to China and India. These findings underline how the disparities in economic levels between developed and developing countries are reflected in net-zero building approaches. Based on these insights, professionals in the field can develop tailored strategies to bridge the gap in net-zero building development between developed and developing nations.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of vertical shadings on the cross-ventilation performance in an office building through numerical analysis by utilizing computational fluid dynamics. Site measurements were conducted to compare with the numerical results and were used as boundary conditions for the numerical simulations. The results showed that incorporating vertical shadings with the window has the potential to enhance the ventilation rate when the wind direction ranges from 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.

This study aims to explore the construction method of cold island network by integrating scattered cold island resources, rationally guiding urban planning and construction, and providing effective ideas and methods for improving the urban thermal environment. Taking the central city of Fuzhou as an example, the identification of the cold island core source (CICS) was optimized by applying relative land surface temperature (LST), morphological spatial pattern analysis, and landscape connectivity analysis. The combined resistance surface was constructed based on a spatial principal component analysis. Subsequently, the cold island network was constructed by applying circuit theory and identifying the key nodes. The results showed that the central and eastern parts of the study area experienced the most significant UHI effects and there was a tendency for them to cluster.

The building sector, representing a significant share of energy consumption, accounts for 60 % of energy consumption, particularly in Heating, Ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). Phase change materials (PCMs), distinguished by their ability to store and release substantial heat in response to ambient temperature changes, emerge as promising solutions for integrating thermal regulation technologies in building design. While literature showcases studies demonstrating the incorporation of PCMs into various building materials, there is a dearth of comprehensive reviews covering their integration into building components. This study classifies PCMs based on material composition and the nature of phase change, presenting a brief overview to highlight their diverse applications in the thermal regulation of buildings. Further, it summarizes various studies on PCM incorporation in building materials such as roofs, walls, cement, bricks, paints, floors, and windows, bridging the gap in existing research. Solid-liquid organic PCMs are widely researched compared to inorganic and solid-solid PCMs for building applications. Solid-liquid PCMs require containment for liquid state handling during phase changes, mainly applied in encapsulated forms. Building components such as bricks and floors can incorporate PCMs in any encapsulated form. Based on the Review findings, adding PCM to cement plaster often reduces mechanical properties and increases cement porosity, impacting the hydration process, except when using dopamine-coated cenosphere PCM capsules. Phase change paints, primarily utilizing micro/nano encapsulated PCMs, reveal varying effects on paint properties based on the percentage of PCM capsules added, with peak temperature reductions of 1\u20136 \u00b0C observed in building applications. Solid-solid PCMs are primarily applied in windows, where PCM-filled glazed windows significantly reduce peak temperatures up to 9 \u00b0C. Reduction in peak temperatures from 1 \u00b0C\u20137 \u00b0C and heat loads by 19\u201359 % were observed for PCM integrated in Roof. South-faced walls equipped with PCM layers exhibit superior thermal performance compared to other orientations.

The changing climate may influence building performance in several different aspects. In respect to the hygrothermal performance, excessive moisture arising from climate loads and present in wall assemblies over a prolonged period of time is the cause of many detrimental effects on wall components; notably, such effects may become more significant under a changing climate. The occurrence of these effects can be assessed by undertaking hygrothermal simulations. However, numerical simulations can be time-consuming, especially when evaluating the detrimental effects over a long period, which is necessary for assessing the impacts of climate change on building envelope components. A means to reduce such a time consuming and costly simulation effort is to select a set of representative years from the series of long-term climate data; a set of Moisture Reference Year (MRY), with the expectation of obtaining similar results as those obtained from the long-term simulations. This study assesses the reliability of using MRY for evaluating the long-term hygrothermal performance of wall assemblies.

The challenging problem of energy subsidies and tariff policy is compounded in regions with hot climates, heavily subsidized energy, and lax energy regulations. Across the MENA region, mosques are the quintessential specimen of government-owned and -operated buildings. Their distinct intermittent operation presents an additional challenge. The objective is to determine configurations that result in optimum energy-savings and life-cycle cost, and propose subsidy strategies that maximize the former and minimize the latter, under a range of realistic tariffs. Three models for system initial costs (linear, exponential, and empirical) were explored. A hybrid workflow across EnergyPlus simulation engine and MATLAB subroutines were utilized to investigate interactions between all energy-related parameters for brute-force life-cycle cost optimization. Forty possible tariffs were considered for 6000 envelope-system combinations, with 11 different system cost increase scenario, totaling 2.64 million cases. When low tariffs were considered, the optimum structures that gave the highest energy savings were marked by low systems COPs.

Summary The use of curved forms in tall buildings has increased recently due to their structural and esthetic advantages. Diagrid structures are typically used for these buildings because of their ability to express curved forms. There are, however, few studies about the curvature of tall buildings. This paper examines the effect of curvature on the wind force on tall curved buildings with diagrid system. So, to achieve this, the form of tall curved buildings is investigated, and the commonly used equations that constitute their form are determined. Then, applying computational fluid dynamics simulation, wind force was calculated on the developed alternatives which were created by the equations. Besides, the structural mass of each model is calculated by optimizing the cross\u2010section of the members. It is concluded that considering the conditions of the applied model, by increasing the concavity of the form, the suction on the building's facade increases. Further, with the increase of the concavity in the plan and elevation, the along wind force on the structure and overturning moment increases. Also, it is observed that the structural efficiency of curvilinear buildings is only appropriate to a certain extent of curvature, and with its increase, the structural efficiency decreases.

However, the threshold of this thermal sensation, that is, the degree of change in skin temperature from the baseline at which the first subjective response to the thermal effects of the millimeter waves occurs, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the thermal sensation threshold and assessed its reliability when exposed to millimeter waves. Twenty healthy adults were exposed to 28 GHz millimeter-wave on their left middle fingertip at five levels of antenna input power: 0.2, 1.1, 1.6, 2.1, and 3.4 W (incident power density: 27\u2013399 mW/cm 2 ). This measurement session was repeated twice on the same day to evaluate the threshold reliability. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland\u2013Altman analysis were used as proxies for the relative and absolute reliability, respectively. The number of participants who perceived a sensation during the two sessions at each exposure level was also counted as the perception rate. Mean thermal sensation thresholds were within 0.9\u00b0C\u20131.0\u00b0C for the 126\u2013399 mW/cm 2 conditions, while that was 0.2\u00b0C for the 27 mW/cm 2 condition. The ICCs for the threshold at 27 and 126 mW/cm 2 were interpreted as poor and fair, respectively, while those at higher exposure levels were moderate to substantial. Apart from a proportional bias in the 191 mW/cm 2 condition, there was no fixed bias. All participants perceived a thermal sensation at 399 mW/cm 2 in both sessions, and the perception rate gradually decreased with lower exposure levels. Importantly, two-thirds of the participants answered that they felt a thermal sensation in both or one of the sessions at 27 mW/cm 2 , despite the low-temperature increase.

As the frequency and intensity of heatwaves will continue to increase in the future, accurate and high-resolution mapping and forecasting of human outdoor thermal comfort in urban environments are of great importance. This study presents a machine-learning-based outdoor thermal comfort model with a good trade-off between computational cost, complexity, and accuracy compared to common numerical urban climate models. The machine learning approach is basically an emulation of different numerical urban climate models. The final model consists of four submodels that predict air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and mean radiant temperature based on meteorological forcing and geospatial data on building forms, land cover, and vegetation. These variables are then combined into a thermal index (universal thermal climate index \u2013 UTCI). All four submodel predictions and the final model output are evaluated using street-level measurements from a dense urban sensor network in Freiburg, Germany. The final model has a mean absolute error of 2.3 K. Based on a city-wide simulation for Freiburg, we demonstrate that the model is fast and versatile enough to simulate multiple years at hourly time steps to predict street-level UTCI at 1 m spatial resolution for an entire city.

The basic element of the new structural material is made of a foam polystyrene core that is self extinguishing and chemically inert with varying density and thickness depending on panel type.

This study assesses the feasibility and climatic implications of wide-scale implementation of green infrastructure (GI) for heat mitigation in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\u2014a representative desert city characterized by low vegetation coverage, severe summer heat, and drought. Weather research forecasting model (WRF) is used to simulate GI cooling measures in Riyadh\u2019s summer condition, including measures of increasing vegetation coverage up to 60%, considering irrigation and vegetation types (tall/short). In Riyadh, without irrigation, increasing GI fails to cool the city and can even lead to warming (0.1 to 0.3 \u00b0C). Despite irrigation, Riyadh\u2019s overall GI cooling effect is 50% lower than GI cooling expectations based on literature meta-analyses, in terms of average peak hour temperature reduction.

Anthropogenic light impacts both wildlife and human well-being, and national parks are some of the only remaining large swaths of land where natural dark skies remain. Over the past two decades, a significant amount of science has contributed both to our understanding of these impacts and to engineering advances to reduce negative lighting effects. This has resulted in changes to lighting infrastructure in some national parks, and growth in Dark Sky Certification for many protected areas globally. To date, changing infrastructure, such as street and parking lot lighting, to less intrusive hues and intensities or removing lights altogether have been some of the sustainable changes made in these areas. This study advances our understanding of lighting issues by examining national park visitors\u2019 perceptions of personal lighting use (e.g., headlamps). Specifically, this study explores camper and mountaineer perceptions of personal lighting devices and their impact on social and ecological systems in Grand Teton National Park, USA. During peak visitation in the summer of 2023, 17 mountaineer interviews and 16 general camper interviews took place in the park at night. Results indicate that campers and mountaineers are largely unaware of anthropogenic light impacts on wildlife and humans. However, once informed, they are willing to change their behaviors and reduce the use of personal lighting devices and use more wildlife-friendly lighting with amber or red settings (which, to date, are just emerging and available for general consumers by several companies). These results provide insights for developing educational strategies and personal lighting engineering designs that will ultimately lead to more sustainable normative shifts capable of reducing anthropogenic lighting impacts in parks and beyond.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4392155184"}}

In its simplest terms, a closed-cavity fa\u00e7ade (CCF) is a sealed, unventilated enclosure equipped with motorized shading devices, internal double or triple glazing, and external single glazing. This technology effectively controls solar energy and daylight entry into buildings. This research aims to enhance the thermal efficiency of CCFs in tropical climates using Venetian blinds (VB) and advanced glass coatings. EnergyPlus and DesignBuilder were employed to assess various CCF designs and compare them to a single glazing unit (SGU) with grey coatings. This was inspired by a residential case study on Penang Island, Malaysia. The findings indicate that CCFs surpass SGUs in thermal performance and occupant comfort, particularly in Malaysia\u2019s humid tropical climate. CCFs reduced operating temperatures by a monthly percentage ranging from 33.5% to 68.75% in all operations. On an annual basis, temperature reductions ranged from 27.5% to 80.25%, with maximum decreases between 2 \u00b0C and 4 \u00b0C and minimum decreases between 0.5 \u00b0C and 1 \u00b0C compared to SGU units. The results show that CCFs outperform SGUs in thermal performance and comfort, reducing operating temperatures by 33.5% to 68.75% monthly and 27.5% to 80.25% annually. Temperature reductions ranged between 2 \u00b0C and 4 \u00b0C at maximum and 0.5 \u00b0C and 1 \u00b0C at minimum compared to SGU. Notably, Venetian blinds with nano-coatings (83/58) and low-E coatings (83/23) (Tvis/Tsol) were the most effective. This study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate coatings for CCFs, and demonstrates their potential in enhancing interior temperatures and comfort in Malaysia\u2019s climate.

Reducing building energy use, a linchpin of climate change mitigation, is a daunting challenge across the world. Gaining increasing attention, retro-commissioning (RCx) is a systematic process that can improve building energy performance. Using a techno-legal lens to review statutes and guides on RCx, this study reveals that in China, a national standard on building commissioning has taken effect yet RCx statutes are hitherto not found. The United States has RCx statutes enacted over 14 states; scrutinizing the statutes of five cities unveils similarities and differences in their scope of control and compliance requirements. In the absence of a specific RCx statute, the guide of Hong Kong, China provides detailed guidance for energy saving practices. While these findings can serve as reference for other places planning to formulate laws or guidance on RCx, the need to further study the effectiveness of mandating RCx for reducing building energy use is highlighted. A conceptual analysis of cost variation with statutory control, which could help policymakers consider from an economic perspective whether or to what extent statutory RCx requirements should be imposed, is also illustrated. This not only contributes insights to the pursuit of an optimal balance between statutory control and voluntary action for energy reduction but also adds to the debate on building energy policies.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4392041755"}}

The objective was to evaluate existing building performance and propose delicate, EE retrofit strategies while preserving the original design character. The overarching objective was to demonstrate a framework through which historically and culturally significant buildings can be investigated for EE retrofitting. Using original construction drawings and current photographs, a 3D BIM model of a typical residential building was developed for analysis and energy simulations. Next, using Revit and Insight 360 simulations, the building's response to environmental conditions was evaluated. Thermal behavior and moisture resistance performance of typical facade systems were evaluated using WINDOW, THERM, and WUFI simulations. Lastly, a full-building energy model was developed in IES-VE software to simulate full-building performance. Results showed that while the conceptualization of this neighborhood paid careful attention to social and environmental factors and had implemented some of the most advanced passive and active technologies of that time, a typical residential building generally underperformed in all evaluated criteria. The proposed retrofit strategies, focusing on improving the building enclosure and implementation of EE mechanical systems, achieved 53% energy-use reduction and elimination of fossil-fuel energy sources.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4392108906"}}

With emerging awareness of the need to explicitly incorporate climate considerations into urban planning and design, integrating current spatial analysis and simulation tools to enhance urban wind corridor planning to obtain the best urban ventilation effect has become an increasingly important research topic in green city development. However, how to systematically carry out urban wind corridor planning by employing related technology and simulation tools is a topic that needs to be explored urgently in both theory and practice.

The research results reveal that the urban form of Zhumadian City favors the development of urban wind corridors, and that the railway lines and some major roads in the city have the potential to be developed as the city\u2019s main wind corridors. However, there are still ventilation barriers resulting from the existing land use model and building layout patterns that need to be adjusted. In terms of local-level analysis, the CFD simulation analysis also reveals that some common building layout patterns may result in environments with poor ventilation. Finally, based on the results of our empirical analysis and local planning environment, specific suggestions are provided on how to develop appropriate strategies for urban wind corridor planning and adjustments related to land use planning and building layout patterns in order to mitigate the impact of the urban heat island effect.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391994372"}}

The urban heat island (UHI) and its intensity is one of the phenomena that are of determining importance for the comfort of living in cities and their sustainable development in the face of deepening climate change. The study is objectively difficult due to the large dynamics like land cover and the considerable diversity of land use patterns in urban areas. Most of the frequently used research practice approaches provide information with problematic spatial and temporal resolution, making them difficult to apply for sustainable urban planning purposes. This paper proposes to calculate SUHI intensity as the difference between the temperature of a given point within a city and the average minimum temperature of the land cover class with the lowest surface temperatures within the same urban area.

This study aims to develop and evaluate a vertically rotated fin shading system for an energy-efficient, user-friendly office space. The system was designed to protect a 4 \u00d7 8 m office room with a south-facing facade from excessive solar radiation and glare. The shading system was modelled and simulated using Rhino/Ladybug 1.6.0 software with Radiance engine, based on real-weather data (*.epw file) for Wroc\u0142aw, Poland at 51\u00b0 lat. The simulation calculated the useful daylight illuminance (UDI) for 300\u20133000 lux and the daylight glare probability (DGP) for ten static and four kinetic variants of the system. The optimal angle of the fin rotation for the static variant was found to be \u03b1 = 40\u00b0. The kinetic variants were activated when the work plane illuminance exceeded 3000 lux, as detected by an internal sensor \u201cA\u201d. The simulation results show that the kinetic system improved the daylight uniformity in the office room, achieving UDI300\u20133000 values above 80% for more than 40% of the room area. A prototype of the system in a 1:20 scale was built and tested on a testbed at Wroc\u0142aw University of Science and Technology, using TESTO THL 160 data loggers. The measurements were conducted for a week in early November 2023, and three clear days were selected for analysis. The measurement results indicate that the low solar altitude on clear days causes high illuminance peaks (15\u201318 Klux) and significant contrast in the room, leading to unsatisfactory DGP values consistent with the simulation outcomes. Therefore, the study concludes that the proposed system may need an additional shading device to prevent glare during periods of low solar altitudes.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391997618"}}

Based on these datasets, Munich has exhibited more unfavourable thermal conditions than Lisbon. In terms of UHII, both cities have shown that low, medium, and high rise compact urban areas and bare rock or paved areas have the highest values, while sparsely built areas have the lowest. These results differ from the UTCI, which indicates that in Lisbon and Munich, these sparsely built areas as well as areas with low plants and vegetation are the most uncomfortable. In Munich, the population was exposed to very strong heat stress, while Lisbon experienced strong heat stress conditions. Conversely, low, medium, and high rise compact urban areas and densely wooded areas in Munich, and scattered trees areas and large low-rise urban areas in Lisbon, have demonstrated the lowest monthly mean and average maximum values.

This paper addresses this issue by presenting a systematic review on the advancements in research on thermal comfort in urban residential buildings in China.

Finally, this paper analyzes the thermal comfort survey data from different researchers, discusses the impacts of adaptive behaviors on human thermal comfort, and provides recommendations for future research on urban residential thermal comfort. It was found that people have higher and higher requirements for their indoor thermal environment as time goes by, especially in the winter; the thermoneutral temperature is higher in warmer climate regions in the summer but lower in the winter than in colder climate regions; the thermoneutral temperature tends to increase with the indoor air temperature due to an adaptation to the indoor thermal environment.

Green roofs can be a valid solution for stormwater management in urban environments. The objective of this study was to develop a laboratory procedure for the hydraulic characterization of artificial substrates, used in the realization of green roofs, based on transient evaporation and steady-state unit hydraulic gradient (UHG) experiments. The retention, \u03b8(h), and hydraulic conductivity, K(h), curves of two commercial substrates Terra Mediterranea\u00ae (TMT) and AgriTERRAM\u00ae (ATV) and a specifically developed substrate made by mixing peat, compost and sandy loam soil (MIX) were investigated. The unimodal van Genuchten\u2013Mualem (VGM) hydraulic functions obtained by the direct evaporation method with different choices of the fitting parameters were compared with UHG measurements of K(h) conducted close to saturation. A numerical inversion of the transient evaporation experiments performed by Hydrus-1D software was also conducted, assuming that the hydraulic properties could be expressed either by unimodal or bimodal VGM models. The results indicated that an appropriate a priori choice of the residual water content parameter improved the estimation of the water retention curve. Moreover, the water retention data estimated from the direct evaporation method were not statistically different from those obtained with the inverse Hydrus-1D. The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity estimations obtained by the direct and inverse methods were highly correlated and the use of the bimodal VGM model improved the estimation of K(h) in the wet range. The numerical inversion of laboratory evaporation data with the hydraulic characteristics expressed by the bimodal VGM model proved to be a reliable and effective procedure for hydraulic characterization of artificial substrates, thus improving the reliability of simulated water fluxes in green roofs.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391944675"}}

In the building renovation industry, a growing volume of discarded insulation materials, such as stone wool insulation, prematurely finds its way to landfills or incinerators after building demolitions. However, these materials often did not reach their complete service life potential, and the reuse of insulation materials is usually not considered in current building practices. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the potential challenges associated with repurposing stone wool insulation from existing flat roofs. By means of detailed assessments via dismantling and performance evaluations of collected stone wool insulation boards up to 28 years old, this research reveals the unavoidable damages that occur upon dismantling yet emphasizes that this does not impede reuse. While density and thermal performance remain stable over time, water absorption and mechanical stability are affected. In total, 48% of all short-term tests revealed an increase in water absorption, possibly due to hydrophobic substance degradation. Mechanical performances of aged SW insulation from flat roofs depend on various factors, with 43% and 33% of compression and puncture resistance tests, respectively, not meeting current standards. Beyond a durability assessment, this study advocates for a multidisciplinary approach, uniting materials science, construction engineering, and sustainability insights, to creatively repurpose used insulation materials into future projects.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391947942"}}

This paper aims to evaluate the performance of passive cooling in Javanese vernacular houses through observation techniques and field measurements. Passive cooling performance is limited to visually appropriate aspects of building elements as well as air temperature measurement results that fall within the comfortable temperature limit along with the magnitude of the decrease in air temperature in the building. Visual methods are used to determine the suitability of passive design parameters, while field measurements are carried out to assess comfort levels and air temperature reductions.

Abstract Conventional optical spatial modulation (SM) scheme activates one of the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to transmit an intensity-modulated optical signal, in which the index of the activated LED is determined by spatial symbol and the emitted intensity is controlled by temporal symbol. In order to enhance the spectral efficiency (bits per channel use), we propose a joint SM and pulse amplitude width modulation (PAWM) as a novel optical spatial\u2013temporal signaling scheme. In this paper, the proposed SM-PAWM optical signaling scheme is applied in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) system. Employing optimal maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm to extract the spatial and temporal symbols is computationally prohibitive; hence, we develop a novel low-complexity detection scheme that converts the joint optimization problem separately to decode the spatial and temporal symbols. Moreover, theoretical results in terms of the successful identification probability of activated LED as well as the overall symbol error rate are derived. Extensive computer simulations are performed to validate the analytical results. It is shown that the proposed detection scheme is a feasible alternative to the ML detector in the VLC-MIMO system employing SM-PAWM.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391786506"}}

In this work, we focus on the thermal analysis of convective heat transfer using a honeycomb heat sink designed for LEDs lamp cooling. Three different heat sink geometries were examined: an aluminum-filled honeycomb radiator, a hollow honeycomb radiator, and a hollow honeycomb radiator incorporating a phase change material (PCM) layer. The results obtained from numerical simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae showed that the third heat sink geometry, when employed in short-duration lighting applications, led to a 25% reduction in temperature for a 20W power lamp. We also determined the optimal operational time, during which the temperature drop is maximum.

The mean core temperature reported significant variations throughout the protocol, with decreases during the initial 10 min of cold exposure and posterior increases despite the cold environment.

An important energy-saving method to optimize building envelope design is the integration of local climate characteristics. This study attempts to find sloped facade configurations to balance air conditioning energy demand and daylight utilization for four directions in an area with a hot climate. Tilt angle dependence of the air conditioning energy demand, useful daylight illuminance (UDI) and daylight glare index (DGI) are selected to investigate the acceptance thresholds of the tilt angle. The final facade\u2019s configuration is achieved by employing the graphical optimization method. An acceptable solution that balances better daylight performance and less energy consumption by air conditioning is developed. Due to the considered city being located in a low-latitude area with great daylight availability as well as a fully dimmable light control strategy, unbearable glare reduction can be achieved by benefiting from the sloped facades, without necessarily sacrificing much usable daylight. Meanwhile, there is no obvious increase in the demand for lighting energy consumption, and a good outward view is preserved. The sloped rather than vertical facade provides natural solar shading to the east-, south- and west-oriented windows while allowing low-angle winter solar heat to warm the building space. Tilt angles between 35\u00b0and 40\u00b0 are preferred for the east facade, and smaller tilt angles of between 30\u00b0and 35\u00b0 are recommended for the south facade.

This study seeks to encourage the adoption of the bottle house concept for affordable housing by conducting a thermal comfort survey of its occupants. To obtain the thermal sensation vote (TSV) of the occupants, thermal comfort questionnaires were developed based on the seven-point ASHRAE thermal sensation scale. Additionally, a Testo 480 multifunction meter, which comprised an anemometer, radiant globe thermometer, air thermometer, and relative humidity probe, was used to calculate the predicted mean vote (PMV) concurrently. From the results of the TSV, mean votes of the participants of \u22122.0, 2.0, and 2.4 were observed for the bottle house, mud houses, and cement houses, respectively. In comparison, adjusted PMV mean values of 1.9, 2.1 and 2.1 were recorded for the bottle house, mud houses, and cement houses, respectively. The TSV and PMV results both indicate that the occupants of the bottle house felt more thermally comfortable when compared to occupants in the other dwellings. This can be attributed to the measures incorporated during the construction of the bottle house. Furthermore, the use of a simulation study helped proffer solutions to further improve the indoor temperatures of the buildings used in this study. The results of this paper will provide evidence of the prospects of upcycling plastic waste for construction and its impact on occupant\u2019s thermal comfort when compared to conventional building materials.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391575050"}}

As a major component of the building envelope, the energy-saving design of exterior windows is key to energy savings in office buildings. The conventional design of exterior windows mainly focused on their impact on heating and cooling energy but ignored the indoor thermal comfort problems caused by the direct solar radiation transmitted by windows and the fluctuation of their internal surface temperatures. This study analyzed the influence of exterior windows on the indoor thermal environment of office buildings by carrying out field experiments. The experiments were carried out in a typical office building in Xi\u2019an during December and January. The impact of exterior windows on human thermal comfort was studied from two perspectives: longwave radiation from the surface of window glass and solar shortwave radiation. It was found that solar radiation was the main cause of temperature fluctuations on the internal surface of windows and created non-uniform thermal environments. The mean radiant temperature fluctuations in the near-window area could reach up to 7.8 \u00b0C due to outdoor solar radiation in winter. Solar radiation transmitted by windows directly affects thermal sensations. Since conventional thermal comfort models or indices underestimated the thermal sensations of occupants in the presence of solar radiation, the additional thermal loads caused by solar radiation needed to be taken into account. The allowable operative temperature range for maintaining thermal comfort should be reduced by 0.5 \u00b0C when occupants are exposed to solar radiation.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391577179"}}

While previous research predominantly focused on sensor deployment in single scenes such as offices and classrooms, these approaches are inadequate for multi-scene analysis of daylight in residential areas. Moreover, traditional deployment methods can negatively impact the quality of life and everyday living experience. To overcome these limitations, a prediction model is developed to estimate ceiling and window illuminance, as well as work surface illuminance in various scenes within residential buildings. The Dialux software is employed for data simulation, and a GA-optimized BP neural network is utilized to train the model, establishing the mapping relationship between input variables and corresponding illuminance outputs. By inputting sensor values from different scenarios into the model, the predicted daylight illuminance values can be obtained.

Because of their great diversity in terms of molecular signature, terminal endings morphology and electrophysiological properties, mirroring the complexity of tactile experience, LTMRs are a model of choice to study the molecular cues differentially controlling neuronal diversification.

Here we identified the TALE homeodomain transcription factor Meis2 as a key regulator of LTMRs target-field innervation. Meis2 is specifically expressed in cutaneous LTMRs and its expression depends on target-derived signals. While LTMRs lacking Meis2 survived and are normally specified, their end-organ innervations, electrophysiological properties and transcriptome are differentially and markedly affected, resulting in impaired sensory-evoked behavioral responses.

Solar radiation enters the building through the glass by both radiation and conduction. The heat passing through the glass is one of the largest cooling loads. Therefore, modifying the glass type, will potentially reduce the cooling load significantly. This numerical study uses Cooling Load Temperature Difference (CLTD) method to calculate the change in cooling load in a five-story hospital. The Glass material was changed from clear glass to coated glass. Based on the calculation of cooling load per hour, from 07.00 to 19.00, it is obtained that the peak load occurs at 17.00, both when using clear glass clear and coated glass. The replacement of clear glass with coated glass results in a 70.0% decrease in radiation cooling load, from 104.59 kW to 31.38 kW. In addition, replacing this type of glass will reduce the total cooling load by 17.0%, from 418.80 kW to 347.57 kW. The decrease in total cooling load will lead to a decrease in the operational cost of the air conditioning system.

Artificial lighting comprises nearly one-third of the total electrical load of buildings, resulting in significant carbon emissions. Reducing the carbon emissions caused by artificial lighting is one of the ways to achieve low-carbon buildings. To meet the demand for high-efficiency, energy-saving, and comfortable lighting, light pipes are increasingly used in buildings. This paper reviews the research and development of light pipes and integrated technology. Sky conditions as a dynamic factor always affect the performance of light pipes. The combination of light pipes and an artificial lighting system can effectively solve this problem. A light pipe can be integrated with a ventilation stack to achieve the ventilation and cooling or heating of a building. A lighting-heating coupled light guide can improve the energy efficiency and sustainability in buildings, such as where antimony tin oxide nanofluid is introduced to absorb additional heat and then provide domestic hot water. The application of a photocatalyst to light pipes can realize air purification and self-cleaning. The use of light pipes does not consume electricity and can reduce the time spent using artificial lighting, thus allowing for power savings. From a whole life cycle perspective, the use of light pipes can be a balance of cost and benefit. In conclusion, such information could be useful for engineers, researchers, and designers to assess the suitability of applying integrated light pipes in different building types and examine the potential of energy and cost savings.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391542443"}}

As buildings are one of the major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, they have a key potential for energy efficiency and indoor environmental quality improvement. Therefore, the development of nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEBs) is strategic to respond to these challenges and to design and retrofit sustainable highly performing buildings. Actually, the nZEB target can also be reached with highly insulated wooden technologies. However, they must be critically revised and adapted when taking into account the warm climate peculiarities.

This study evaluates the potential of Boston Ivy (Parthenocissus tricuspidata) to reduce building surface temperature in a mid-latitude North American city center where vine use for this purpose is uncommon. Vegetation can regulate city summer temperatures by providing shade and evaporative cooling. While planting trees has been a focus for many urban municipalities, trees require space (above and below ground), access to water, costly planting and maintenance, and may only be desirable to some city residents. To explore viable vegetation alternatives with fewer growth constraints, we deployed temperature loggers on the exterior walls of buildings in the urban core of Toronto, Canada, a large mid-latitude city. Perennial vines shaded some walls, while others were bare. These devices systematically tracked exterior surface temperature fluctuations over six months, including the growing season, with full vine-leaf coverage. During peak solar access periods, average daily temperature differentials between vine-shaded and non-shaded building surfaces ranged from up to 6.5 \u00b0C on south-facing building exteriors to 7.0 \u00b0C on west-facing walls. Models were developed to estimate daily degree hour difference, a metric integrating the magnitude and duration of the temperature-moderating potential of vines. At ambient temperatures \u2265 23 \u00b0C, solar radiation intensity and ambient air temperature were positively correlated with vine effectiveness in mitigating the rise in built surface temperature; relative humidity was negatively associated. Installing vine cover on urban buildings in the form of green fa\u00e7ades can complement tree planting as cities become hotter due to climate change, and space for growing trees diminishes with urban densification.

Hence, radiant cooling capacity of 0.99 kWh/m2\u00b7day and radiant cooling ratio of 47 % can be achieved by the novel Trombe wall, with electricity consumption only at valley period. Moreover, economic saving of 55.0 CNY/day and decarbonization potential of 23.8 kg CO2,e/day can be achieved when the novel Trombe wall is integrated into a typical office building in subtropical climate Guangzhou. This study provides a novel structural design and optimal operation strategies on a Trombe wall, together with guidelines on techno-economic-environmental performance improvement, promoting effective natural cooling energy utilization and energy-flexible/efficient radiant cooling for decarbonization of buildings in cooling-dominant regions.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4388750213"}}

A ventilated air interlayer placed in a wall can help dehumidify the wall and indoor air. This paper presents an experimental study of the heat, air, and moisture variations within the envelope wall of a chamber featuring different air interlayer settings under real outdoor air conditions during the summer of 2020 in Shanghai, China. Self-developed humidity-controlling building materials were applied to the inner building envelope. Temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and heat-flow sensors were placed at different positions in the middle of the wall. These parameters were measured and recorded in real-time under three working conditions: humidification, dehumidification, and ventilation. The experimental results show that under the ventilation working conditions, moisture content of 0.52 kg can be removed after a 2-h air layer ventilation, which can benefit the design strategy for the humidification and ventilation of dehumidification walls.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4293047259"}}

Therefore, there is an urgent need to examine the impacts of urban features and changes on the LST. This study focused on the relationship between LST and urban land changes and the impact of these changes on LST during different periods. Although a set of studies explored the relationship between landscape features and urban LST, several aspects still need further discussion. Here, the study aims to explore the influence of landscape features and land cover patterns on land surface temperature LST in two cities (Amman and Zarqa) in Jordan, and identify which of these features (vegetation cover, built-up and population density) has the most effective and influence on LST values. Therefore, this paper is the first study about land surface temperature LST and its relations with these aspects in Jordan. This study used a mixed method approach using quantitative method (GIS) and qualitative method (comparative case studies). This study revealed that the most important features affecting the LST values were: (1) Population density; (2) Built-up; and (3) Vegetation, and in descending order from the strongest to the least effective. It is also concluded that in the city in which the population density is high, the effect of built-up areas on the values of LST is as high as possible and positive more than the cities with medium and low population density. As for the city in which the population density is medium to low, the effect of vegetation cover on the values of LST is greater, and this can be more positive than in cities with a high population density.

We surveyed 223 participants in peri-urban forests with varying biodiversity levels in Austria, Belgium and Germany. Using microclimate sensors, questionnaires and saliva cortisol measures, we monitored intra-individual changes in thermal and mental states from non-forest baseline to forest conditions. Forests reduced daytime modified Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (mPET; an indicator for perceived temperature) by an average of 9.2 \u00b0C. High diversity forests were the coolest, likely due to their higher stand density. Forests also lowered thermal sensation votes, with only 1 % of participants feeling \u2018warm\u2019 or \u2018hot\u2019 compared to 34 % under baseline conditions. Despite the desire for a temperature increase among 47 % participants under cool forest conditions, approximately two-thirds still reported feeling very comfortable, in contrast to only one-third under baseline conditions. Even at a constant perceived temperature, participants were 2.7 times more likely to feel warmer under baseline conditions compared to forests. A forest-induced psychological effect may underlie these discrepancies, as supported by significant improvements in positive and negative affect (emotional state), state anxiety and perceived stress observed in forests.

If the lowest energy demand is desired, it is crucial to determine the ideal thermophysical properties of the envelope over the buildings' life span. However, the scientific literature is still scarce in providing a compelling answer. Therefore, this study (i) determines ideal thermal transmittance values (U-values) for present-day and future climates, (ii) determines to what extent the thermophysical properties will need to change to remain ideal, (iii) identifies different trends of U-values over time, (iv) establishes a relationship between outdoor air temperatures, cooling and heating setpoints, and ideal U-values, and (v) proposes a set of design strategies according to each trend. The EPSAP generative design method was used to create a large dataset of residential buildings with random geometries and U-values to evaluate their energy demand for heating and cooling in EnergyPlus. The thermal performance of each building was evaluated for 30 locations in Brazil for the current period and two future timeframes (2050 and 2080). The Future Weather Generator tool was used to morph today's typical meteorological weather to match the EC-Earth3 data for the SSP5\u20138.5 scenario.

The study analyzed the differences in air temperature (\u0394Ta), relative humidity (\u0394RH), and dew-point temperature (\u0394Tdew) between the urban and rural sites. These climatic data were then used as inputs for energy simulation of a residential building. The following results were revealed: (1) \u0394Ta was consistently higher at night than during the day. In comparison to the rural reference sites, the RH values at all urban sites were lower; however, some urban sites displayed lower Tdew, while others exhibited higher Tdew. (2) Regarding annual total energy demands, urban buildings exhibited variable changes in energy components compared to rural buildings. Sensible cooling demands increased by 10 %\u201336 %, while heating demands decreased by 9 %\u201330 %. Latent cooling demands ranged from a decrease of 12 % to an increase of 17 %.

Indoor environmental quality of buildings, including thermal, acoustic, visual comfort, and air quality, directly impacts the comfort, health, and productivity of occupants. However, in Brazil, the high deficit of affordable housing units has led to a situation where environmental quality is often overlooked in favour of low investment costs, prioritizing quantity over quality. Furthermore, the poorest segments of the population, who rely on affordable housing, are disproportionately affected by energy costs. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct research on low-cost energy solutions for social housing to improve the sustainability of people's lives. In this light, a study was conducted to monitor the energy performance of a vegetated wall made of deciduous species and compare it to a bare wall used in an affordable house in subtropical Brazil. Parameters, such as internal and external surface temperatures, nearby microclimatic conditions, and heat transfer through the vegetated and bare walls, were monitored every 5 min over a two-year period. The heat flux analysis revealed that the vegetated wall reduced conductive heat up to 83 % during summer days, significantly lowering the external surface temperature by 8.6 \u00b0C due to the presence of the plant layer. Moreover, the vegetated wall generally exhibited lower shortwave and longwave radiative and convective heat fluxes.

An empirical study in Chongqing University, China based on field experiments, numerical simulations, and post-processing of outdoor thermal environments and comfort was conducted, to demonstrate the applicability of the framework in actual educational precincts. The results indicated the spatiotemporal variability of surface temperature and outdoor thermal comfort, exhibited the right time and proper cooling infrastructure selection, and identified the adaptive walkable paths. For instance, the universal thermal climate index (UTCI) with sun exposure had a mean value of 46.8\u00b0C and a maximum value of 51.4\u00b0C at 14:00, while the mean UTCI of the tree, sunshade and pavilion were 8.1\u00b0C, 9.3\u00b0C and 10.6\u00b0C lower than that of the full exposure means, respectively.

Passive radiative cooling (PRC) is a promising carbon reduction technology that radiates heat into the universe through atmospheric transparency window (ATW) to cool objects below ambient temperature with zero energy consumption. However, so far the cooling efficiencies of most PRC designs are inevitably restrained by inadequate optical properties and parasitic heat gains from ambient air. These defects are overcome by developing aerogel coolers with functional integration of low absorption of solar irradiance, strong mid-infrared emittance, and high thermal insulation in one design. In particular, cross-linked silica-hybridized cellulose acetate is exploited to construct robust aerogels with well-arranged nano/micro porous structures, representing a solar reflectance up to \u223c96 % and an ATW emissivity of \u223c97 %. Such aerogels can realize a subambient temperature drop of \u223c9.15 \u00b0C during the daytime and maintain their remarkable cooling performance even in cloudy, moist, and windy climates. The aerogel coolers also show excellent anti-aging, self-cleaning, and compression resistance, making them adaptable for long-term cooling applications. The year-round energy consumption simulations demonstrate that an average total energy saving of 13.87 kW m\u22122 per year can be promisingly achieved in China when the aerogel coolers are integrated on building roofs.

The hydronic thermal barriers with dynamically adjustable thermal performance have become one of the highly anticipated solutions for opaque envelope insulation while improving the efficiency of the use of low-grade energy. In response to the technical constraints encountered by conventional hydronic thermal barrier walls (i.e., CHTBs) when it comes to enhancing heat transfer, the concept of modular hydronic thermal barrier walls (i.e., MHTBs) was introduced. The MHTB incorporates a heat injection system within its filler cavities, a feature designed to promote the overall thermal performance of the opaque enclosure structure. The performance enhancement described is mainly achieved through active management of the thermal conductivity of the filling material within the vicinity of fluid pipes. In this study, field thermal performance assessments were carried out during winter conditions in three reduced-scale experimental rooms. The southern boundary of these test rooms adopts walls with different configurations, i.e., MHTB, CHTB, and traditional thermal insulation wall. Subsequently, a comprehensive investigation regarding the impacts of filling materials on the energy performances of MHTB was conducted through numerical simulations. The outcomes demonstrated a substantial reduction in heat loss through the south wall by using MHTB, leading to reduced room thermal discomfort. In particular, with a charging temperature set at 35.0 \u00b0C, the inner surface temperature of MHTB displayed a noteworthy increase of 10.3 \u00b0C compared to that of the traditional thermal insulation wall, resulting in a significant reduction in heat load by a factor of 7.4. Additionally, it was observed that the filler material within the pipe cavity played a vital role in shaping MHTB's thermal performance. For instance, considering the case with a heat injection temperature of 25.0 \u00b0C, a doubling of thermal conductivity resulted in an enhancement of 0.24 W/m2 in heat gain on the outer surface and an overall increase of 0.04 MJ in total injected heat.

Given the significant energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with buildings, there is increasing interest in improving sustainability of building operations to reduce impact on climate change. A common goal is to operate buildings as \u201cnet-zero\u201d energy users in which all energy consumed by the building is balanced against renewable energy purchased from the grid or produced on site. To achieve net-zero status, many buildings will require significant retrofit so as to both reduce energy consumption in the absolute sense and provide the remainder without consuming fossil fuels. Thus, multi-year planning is required to ensure that goals can be met on time. In addition, due to the inherent uncertainty associated with energy consumption and generation, actually achieving net-zero energy use may require discretionary curtailment actions to be taken, and deciding whether such actions are necessary can be challenging. To address these challenges, we propose in this paper a design optimization and operational planning strategy to make the decisions needed to achieve sustainability goals in buildings. The strategy can be applied to schedule design changes over a long horizon to meet annual targets, and it can also be applied in closed loop on a shorter horizon to determine whether curtailment is needed to stay on track. We discuss the formulation of the optimization problem, solution methods, and modeling approaches for key parameters. Application of the strategy is illustrated via examples.

Although the temperature cycles exceeded the limits in the standards, sustained thermal comfort and high thermal acceptability were achieved when the temperature changed within 25-28 \u00b0C. At a rapid 6 \u00b0C/h change rate, the thermal sensation briefly deviated from the comfort zone when Top changed within 26-29 \u00b0C, suggesting that the limits should be set relative to the temperature change span. The comfortable temperature ranges for change rates of 3 \u00b0C/h and 6 \u00b0C/h in summer conditions were 22.8-28.7 \u00b0C and 22.8-28.4 \u00b0C, respectively, which are broader than the recommended indoor temperature range for summer in the Chinese standard. These findings indicate the potential of temperature variations to extend the thermal comfort zones while consuming less energy without requiring additional cooling devices.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4388979667"}}

However, the ideal performance of a smart window that strikes a good balance between reducing energy consumption, eliminating the discomfort glare, and providing adequate daylight remains unclear.

The natural ventilation strategy is gaining increasing attention from architects due to its advantages in reducing energy consumption and maintaining a healthy indoor environment. For supertall buildings, the vertical variation in outdoor meteorology has inspired us to explore the energy-saving potential by adopting natural ventilation strategy. This study investigates the impact of vertical variation in urban meteorology on the natural ventilation potential (NVP) of supertall buildings based on numerical simulation and field observation. Firstly, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to simulate the urban meteorology of the study region by integrating the local climate zone (LCZ) map. Next, meteorological data from sounding experiments by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and monitoring stations are used to validate the simulated result, and thereby to explore the vertical meteorology in urban area. Finally, the vertical NVP in supertall buildings is quantitatively assessed considering the impact of LCZ in urban areas based on thermal comfort models. The findings reveal that atmospheric temperature decreases approximately linearly with increasing altitude, with a maximum temperature gradient of up to \u22120.82 \u00b0C/100 m. Static models underestimated the annual natural ventilation hours (NVHs) by at least 348 h compared to the adaptive thermal comfort model. Compared to low-density building regions, the higher NVP is indicated in high-density building regions.

Radiative cooling technology aims to the energy consumption problem of buildings and environmental pollution caused by the use of Freon in compressor air conditioners. Many kinds of radiative cooling coatings have been attempted, but the cost and large-scale practical application have been challenging. This work prepared a composite coating with a radiative cooling function using calcined kaolin (CK) powder and waterborne fluorocarbon (WF). The inexpensive CK has a wide particle size distribution and exhibits high solar reflectivity (RS) and infrared emissivity (EIR). The excellent adhesion and chemical stability of waterborne fluorocarbon (WF) provides a good guarantee for the practical use of the coating. As a result, the CK/WF coating achieves an RS of 91% and an EIR of 95% in the transparent atmospheric window (ATW) of 8-13 \u03bcm. The coating demonstrated a temperature decline of 3.8 \u00b0C under direct sunlight in the field. The coating meets the conditions for large-scale applications.

The enhancement of the living conditions in big cities since the end of the last century is closely related to changes in the thermal environment and besides in urban microclimate, particularly for metropolitan areas. In this context, a knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability of urban heat island (UHI) became an increasing matter of concern, which can be measured from land surface temperature (LST). Actually, LST can be derived from thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing observations to ensure the necessary spatial and time frequency coverage. But a full exploitation of satellite TIR data cannot be achieved without accounting for the strong anisotropy of urban landscape. Hitherto, a poor investigation was focused on the modeling and the analysis of the directional anisotropies of LSTs considering the complexity of urban building surfaces (e.g., heterogeneity of building morphology and temperature distribution) whereas it is fundamental to establish reliable critical indicators derived from energy balance. Herein, we propose an analytical model to simulate the angular signatures of urban temperatures, in which the geometric optical theory is considered to model the direct radiances of the main components (i.e., sunlit and shaded street, roof and wall). The built model assumes a random distribution of low/middle-rise and high-rise buildings, which depicts realistically the heterogeneity of urban architectural distribution. We evaluated the proposed model using both measured datasets from airborne and satellite sensors and a simulated dataset from a 3D ray-tracing model so-called discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART). Results indicate that 1) the proposed model is effective for simulating directional anisotropies of LSTs, with a root mean square error (RMSE) lower than 0.90 \u00b0C and R2 > 0.49 for comparison with measured datasets; and 2) the directional anisotropies of LSTs are significantly affected by variations in building height, with values possibly exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C.

As the world's largest energy consumer, the building sector is under growing pressure to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. To confront this challenge, the thermal performance of building elements, especially for cooling purposes, must be enhanced. One promising solution involves the incorporation of PCMs to augment a building's thermal mass. Unlike traditional building materials that store thermal energy sensibly, PCMs store it in a latent form by undergoing phase transitions at constant temperatures. This unique characteristic allows PCMs to store and release more heat efficiently than sensible heat thermal energy storage materials. As a result, PCMs have emerged as a prominent solution for passive cooling and heating applications in buildings. This paper proposes a systematic review of existing literature, classifying it based on building components and effective PCM integration methods while considering climatic influences. The primary objective is to comprehensively analyze the application of PCMs within building envelopes to enhance indoor thermal comfort. This study explores various methods for assessing the thermal properties of PCMs and PCM composites. Notably, integrating PCMs into building components like walls and roofs has shown remarkable potential in reducing energy consumption within the building envelope. This approach is precious in lightweight construction, where conventional passive design strategies may fall short.

The standard effective temperature (SET) is a widely recognised index in thermal comfort studies worldwide. The definition of the standard environment is crucial to the validity of SET. It allows SET to evaluate thermal comfort levels in various clothing insulations, air velocities, and metabolic rates. The thermal sensation votes (TSV) should be equivalent when the SET remains constant. Previous studies have focused on applying SET to analyse thermal comfort with diverse environmental factors or clothing insulation conditions but have not compared SET with different metabolic rates. In this study, the original standard environment was examined using experimental results with different metabolic rates. The results revealed that the original standard environment failed to guarantee the \u2018same SET, same TSV\u2019 principle with different metabolic rates. The original standard environment was insufficient in accurately reflecting the effect of the actual activity status on the standard convective heat transfer coefficient and standard clothing insulation. Thus, a new standard environment was developed, incorporating two new variables: the base value of the standard clothing insulation and the convective heat transfer coefficient generated from the actual activities. Through validation of the experimental data, the new standard environment ensured a consistent linear relationship between SET and TSV, in both transient and steady-state conditions, even when the metabolic rate was changed from 1.0 met to 3.8 met. Furthermore, a universal SET was proposed. The universal SET could be applicable to thermal comfort analysis with different metabolic rates in steady-state conditions and activity status transients.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4390331637"}}

The growing impact of climate change, including extreme weather events, represents a significant challenge for humanity. With most of the world's population living in urban areas, the urban heat island effect and anthropogenic heat contribute to elevated city temperatures. This increase in urban warming threatens human health and demands a deeper understanding of thermal distribution in urban environments. Collecting accessible and widespread temperature data in urban areas is essential to address this challenge. This study aims to develop a methodology for anticipating temperature distribution in urban environments, leveraging Citizen Weather Stations (CWS) as valuable crowdsourcing data sources. The ultimate goal is to create a predictive model that estimates urban temperatures based on government meteorological station forecasts, improving urban planning, regulating temperature-based routes, preventing health issues in vulnerable populations, and enhancing urban livability. The methodology is divided into three fundamental stages: data acquisition through CWS with citizen collaboration, the development and evaluation of optimal forecast models based on government weather stations (SWS) data, and its exploitation in terms of utility and applicability. This methodology encompasses data collection and filtering to ensure its usefulness and implement reliable models. The resulting tool facilitates informed decision-making and precise seasonal event planning in urban environments, effectively addressing the challenges of climate extrapolation and contributing to more effective adaptation and mitigation strategies in climate change and heatwaves. The results obtained probe the feasibility of using CWS to predict temperatures in urban environments, which has been demonstrated accurately. This is a significant achievement, as CWS has proven to be a reliable source of climate data for this context. Also, the filtering process described and applied to the case study has proven effective, discarding approximately 34.87% of the data. This is achieved by detecting and eliminating anomalies, considering station availability, and adhering to specific quality criteria. Finally, the developed prediction model has demonstrated its ability to optimally estimate urban temperatures, utilizing climate prediction data provided by government weather stations (SWS). The model performance indicators support this claim.

In this paper, different divalent ions (X = Ni, Cu, Mg, Co, Zn) are doped to replace Mg2+ at the tetrahedral sites in mixed spinel Mg0.95X0.05Al2O4. These substitutions induce variations in the degree of inversion/preferential occupation at the A/B lattice site in MgAl2O4 ceramics because the octahedral stabilization energies change as a function of dopant. According to crystal field theory, the number of d-orbital electrons has a significant impact on the stability of octahedral sites. Therefore, OSPE values vary between 0 Dq and 0.845 Dq for different elements. The higher the OSPE value, the greater the degree of inversion, and the higher the quality factor (Q\u00d7f). The dielectric constant (\u03b5r) and temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (\u03c4f) of Mg0.95X0.05Al2O4 ceramics changes as a function of the ionic polarizability and B-site bond valence. Mg0.95Ni0.05Al2O4 with a higher OSPE (8.45 Dq) and degree of inversion of A/B sites (\u03bb = 0.221), has the better set of microwave dielectric properties (\u03b5r = 8.39, Q\u00d7f = 78,338 GHz, \u03c4f = \u221266.8 ppm/\u00b0C).

Windows significantly influence a building's indoor environment and energy consumption due to their high optical transmittance and low thermal resistance comparing with walls, affecting both indoor daylight comfort and heat gain or loss. Thermotropic (TT) materials can offer dynamic regulation of solar energy, improving building energy efficiency. Parallel slats transparent insulation materials (PS-TIM) integrated into the air cavity of double-glazing windows can effectively increase the thermal resistance of a window. In this study, these two advanced technologies were combined to develop a new type of adaptive fenestration system, named Thermotropic Parallel Slat Transparent Insulation Material (TT PS-TIM) system. The selected TT hydrogel, 5 wt.% poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAm), was sandwiched within polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) slices. The slats were subsequently proposed between two glass panes to form a parallel slat transparent insulation materials system. To investigate the thermal and optical properties of the TT slats as well as the thermal performance (i.e., solar heat gain coefficient, and dynamic thermal performance in summer and winter) of the TT PS-TIM system with different slats intervals, a novel model combining Ray-tracing technique and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been proposed. The findings of this study reveal that a TT PS-TIM system incorporating 5 wt.% PNIPAm slats can offer a substantial reduction (up to 0.5) in solar transmittance as it transitions from a clear to a translucent state. Accompanied with the phase transition of the TT slats, there is a significant reduction in the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) of the window system. This effectively decreases the unwanted solar heat gain, thus improving the overall buildings thermal performance. According to the advanced transient simulation results based on the weather conditions of London, the TT PS-TIM system exhibits superior performance evidenced by over a 30% reduction in heat gain during summer and approximately a 20% reduction in heat loss during winter in contrast to a conventional Double Glazing (DG) system. This is evident in the form of reduced heat gain during summer and minimized heat loss during winter, resulting in a more thermally balanced environment throughout the year.

For the reference building, a comprehensive set of renovation packages were applied to assess the performance of ARA grants. It was noticed that official energy performance certificates (EPC) overestimated before the renovation energy use as well as energy saving by a factor of almost 2. It was notable that in calculated EPCs, after renovation, EP-value was higher than before renovation, EP-value based on measured energy use. The main reasons for faulty energy calculations were strong overestimations in the building leakage rate and ventilation airflow rate.

Their behavioral habits and subjective thermal sensations were recorded, and environmental parameters were measured. Additionally, the elderly population was categorized based on frailty levels as defined in geriatrics, with relevant physical parameters and self-assessments recorded. The results indicate that elderly individuals with different levels of frailty exhibit varying sensitivity to environmental factors.

Abstract Building retrofits are strongly dependent on the individual refurbishment/rehabilitation cycles of buildings. In order to achieve the targeted climate goals for the building sector, it is necessary to make the best possible use of refurbishment opportunities for energy retrofits. Furthermore, it must be considered that the younger the building, the lower the potential for energy savings. The most challenging, yet required, energy retrofits are all yet to come. Given the importance of the refurbishment cycle, the question arises as to what the theoretical refurbishment rate is, what the actual energy retrofit rate is, and what it needs to be in order to meet the climate targets for the residential building stock. The aim of this paper is to model the evolution of the size and retrofit status of national building stocks. This is to be done against the background of the deviation from the actual and theoretical refurbishment cycle. Using current statistics and the past development of the German residential building stock, central parameters like living space, new construction, deconstruction, and the retrofit rate are modeled endogenously. For the latter, influences of economic conditions are implemented through an exogenously set black box variable. The retrofit rate represents a deep energy retrofit and thus allows an easy connection of the model with energy parameters for building classes defined in the web database TABULA for 20 European countries. The results are of relevance for modeling the energy efficiency status of the building stock and deriving suitable conditions for increasing retrofit rates also in other countries. The results show that increasing the energy retrofit rates to 2%/a or more is largely unrealistic. Instead, the focus should be on weak points, especially where short-term savings are concerned. This applies in particular to facades, basement ceilings, and heating systems as well as the efficient use of energy in buildings.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391617733"}}

Taking the central urban area of Guangzhou as an example, the results indicated that the impacts of urban morphology on LST were strongly dependent on the seasons and UFZs types. The effects of urban morphology on LST were similar across spring, autumn, and winter, with the building morphology showing substantial impacts in commercial and residential zones. In summer, the effects of surface biophysical parameters on LST were significant, especially in industrial, residential, and public service zones. In addition, warming and cooling factors varied across seasons and UFZs. Vegetation was the effective cooling factor during summer, with its fragmented and irregular distribution making a prominent cooling effect in commercial and residential zones, and its coverage crucial for reducing LST in industrial and public service zones. Building height was the dominant cooling factor in spring, autumn, and winter. We consider that these findings can enhance our understanding of the driving mechanism of UHI effect and offer precise references for urban planning in different seasons and UFZs to effectively mitigate the UHI effect.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391693627"}}

Kyrgyzstan's high-altitude rural housing sector consumes 3-5 times more energy than European buildings due to ageing infrastructure, lack of insulation, and reliance on non-sustainable resources. One potential solution is the implementation of thermal insulation. However, due to limited public awareness of energy efficiency, inadequate government policies, insufficient technology, and challenging geography, people in rural areas rely on non-sustainable resources such as coal, cow dung, and firewood for heating, which creates a negative impact on the local ecosystems. To close the energy efficiency gap, the paper proposes a sustainable and holistic approach that integrates thermal insulation with effective energy efficiency planning using a staged-renovation approach by utilising locally available insulation materials / resources. The feasibility study presented in the paper was conducted with a simulation-based parametric study to recognise the potential of novel and sustainable insulation structures on building heat demand. This innovative approach can potentially reduce heat demand in high-altitude houses by as much as 70%, offering a transformative solution.

Green roof installations and photovoltaic (PV) systems are widely employed roof retrofits that aid cities in mitigating climate change impacts, while avoiding the need for increased land utilization. By integrating PV systems with vegetation on urban roofs, a photovoltaic-green (PV-Green) system can be achieved for multifunctional use of the roof space, thereby simultaneously achieving PV and greening benefits. However, current research solely based on one retrofit type cannot meet the requirement for assessing the multifunctional retrofit potential of urban roofs. In this study, an assessment method is proposed to identify and quantify the multiple retrofit potential of urban roofs by integrating roof attributes (slope, orientation, and area), roof type (gable or flat), solar attributes (radiation and irradiation duration), and biogeochemical simulation. Moreover, three roof retrofit scenarios, Scenario 1 (S1): maximization of PV-Green roofs, Scenario 2 (S2): maximization of PV economic benefits, and Scenario 3 (S3): maximization of public subjective well-being through roof greening, were designed to allocate the use of urban roof spaces and evaluate their respective potential power and carbon benefits at the city scale. Using Shanghai as an example, the results showed that 85,722 roofs (or 7310.86 ha) were available for multifunctional use. S1 revealed that applying PV-Green roofs can increase the additional green biomass by 0.74 \u00d7 107 kg C/yr compared to only installing PV roofs. Moreover, S1 produced the highest power output of 2.31 \u00d7 1010 kWh/yr to meet 15.4% of Shanghai's electricity demand. S2 identified 609 flat roofs and 70,527 gable roofs that were uneconomical for PV system installation.

Therefore, this study introduced a novel thermal manikin prototype that can achieve active heating, cooling and sweating thermal responses. The prototype incorporated a temperature control system based on semiconductor refrigeration sheets (SRS) and an improved Tanabe thermoregulation model. Additionally, a high-precision syringe pump was employed for sweating control. The control system was assessed under the Constant Skin Temperature (CST) mode. Thermal physiology experiments were conducted to measure forearm skin temperature for both the thermal manikin and 13 male participants under moderate (26 \u00b0C, 50% RH) and high (35 \u00b0C, 30% RH) ambient temperature conditions, both at sea level (0 m) and high altitude (4000 m). The thermal manikin was operated with and without the sweating control system activated. Under the CST mode, the average response time of the four temperature zones was 94.5 s. When the skin temperature was stabilized, the deviation from the target value remained within a range of 0.15 \u00b0C. Analysis of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) values between the thermal manikin, model simulations, and actual human physiological data demonstrated that RMSD values varied between 0.44 \u00b0C and 1.04 \u00b0C under moderate temperature, and between 1.49 \u00b0C and 3.19 \u00b0C under high temperature.

Abstract For decades efforts have been made to reduce the greenhouse gases emissions of buildings by reducing their energy demand with governmental regulations in Europe, pushing towards very low thermal transmittances ( U \u2010values) with ever thicker insulation layers for new buildings. However, there is no linear relationship between the insulation thickness and the heat losses. Therefore, above a certain thickness the consumption of buildings does not decrease significantly. Hereafter a life cycle analysis, including emissions before the building becomes operational is applied to evaluate the impact of the increasing thickness of components on the overall emissions. Publicly available product data sheets are used to compare four insulation materials under three scenarios. These analyses yield interesting results showing that energy\u2010intensive insulation materials lead to a negative impact in the overall energy balance after a certain thickness. Even though there is not always a pronounced optimum insulation thickness, it is logical that further reductions in U \u2010value for new buildings should hence be carefully evaluated. The results show that the optimal thickness is around 20 cm for most materials, while the important major savings come from the first 10 cm.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391824879"}}

The outcomes highlighted that the incorporation of microencapsulated biobased phase change materials significantly influences both building energy consumption and interior temperature.

We studied plant communities of 34 roofs with different designs and urban landscapes in Paris Region for three years. We described the substrate structure and composition, the age, surface, and building height of the roofs, their management intensity, and the landscape around the roofs. Roof substrate design was the strongest driver of floristic richness. Intensive roofs with substrates exceeding 13 cm and composed of 24% of sand, more than 10% of clay and around 50-60% of silt sheltered the highest plant diversity. Roofs with thin substrates, known as extensive roofs, nevertheless play a significant role in the conservation of 26 threatened or rare xerothermophilous plants of sandy open habitats, which are scarce in urban environments. Spontaneous species contributed the most to diversity within and between roofs, with functional complementarity between planted and spontaneous communities, especially for more extreme conditions. Regarding plant performances, we suggested that planted species tolerant to extreme conditions facilitate the establishment of less tolerant spontaneous species.

Urban microclimate faces serious challenges due to increased urbanization and frequent heatwave events. Many studies focused on investigating the holistic quantitative relationships between urban morphology factors and heat island intensity at the city scale, but less effort has been devoted to exploring the relationships on a block scale. Additionally, there is a lack of fast prediction methods for urban microclimate for local climate zones (LCZ) planning and design. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) model to predict the effects of urban morphology factors on the air temperature under local climate zones. The effects of the spatial morphology features on the air temperature were characterized and quantified employing a post-interpretation method. The Pearl River New Town (PRNT), the downtown area of Guangzhou, China, was considered as the research area for the model implementation. The results showed that air temperature prediction accuracy is the best when using the historical three-time step data, with R2 of 0.975. LCZ A has the highest prediction accuracy, with an R2 of 0.990. LCZ 5 has the lowest accuracy, with an R2 of 0.881. Moreover, the effect of urban morphology factors on air temperature was found to be greater than the effect of land cover type. In this regard, the sky view factor (SVF) has the highest impact, followed by the aspect ratio (AR) and the pervious surface fraction (PSF).

By following OECBC guidelines, we can save up to 30% of the energy consumed by an existing building. Besides, energy conservation measures were performed by replacing ceiling fans with brushless direct current (BLDC) fans, existing lights with LED bulbs, and using variable speed drives instead of induction motors. This study will help to define the most efficient energy conservation measures for existing buildings in terms of cost and energy savings. Retrofitting the present building with energy-saving devices will cost INR 21, 32, 90,152 with an overall annual energy savings of 47, 28,177 kWh and a yearly cost saving of INR 319,66,703.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4392094061"}}

In previous studies, geometrical aspects of the buildings have been mainly considered in designing of the models, while the impacts of vegetation distribution have not been taken into account. The influence of building geometry on vegetation distribution to create a comfortable thermal environment for pedestrians has not received much attention. An examination of Sanandaj, a city in western Iran, in three fabrics, closed, linear, and open, has been conducted in this study. By using Envi-met simulator, we studied the orientations, height-to-distance ratio of the buildings, and the geometric shapes of vegetation distributions. There have been two phases to the current research. The first phase includes evaluating the factors that may affect the modeling results in addition to validating Envi-met software in selected fabrics. A comparison is also made of three model fabrics with and without vegetation in the first phase. The most important environmental factors in this research are air temperature, radiant temperature, wind speed, and physiological equivalent temperature (PET). The results show that there is a positive correlation between orientation and the level of comfort. In a closed fabric, the model with an east-west direction, height ratio of 0.12 and wholly vegetation distribution showed 15.31% improvement in comfort level compared to the original fabric. The linear fabric with an east-west direction, height ratio of 0.42 and a central vegetation distribution indicated a 22.53% improvement in the comfort level and in the open fabric, the model with height ratio of 0.75 and the central vegetation distribution improved comfort by 10.42%.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4392133400"}}

Future urban planning requires context-specific integration of spatial design and microclimate especially for tropical cities with extreme weather conditions. Thus, we propose a Combined Spatial-Climatic Design approach to assess impact of urban densification on annual outdoor thermal comfort performance employing ENVI-met simulations for Singapore. We first consider building bylaws and residential site guidelines to develop eight urban-density site options for a target population range. We further classify annual weather data into seven weather-types and use them as boundary conditions for the simulations. Comparing such fifty-six combined spatial-climatic simulation outputs by analyzing Outdoor Thermal Comfort Autonomy, we report the influence of site geometry is nominal on air temperatures but significant for mean radiant temperatures and physiological equivalent temperatures. Neighborhoods with taller (20% increase in mean height) buildings and narrower footprints exhibit better thermal performance compared to short and wider (12-58% decrease in mean width) buildings, due to less radiative heat gain during solar noon. For a high density tropical urban context, like Singapore with high sun angle and solar radiation, mutual shading and presence of wind enhances thermal comfort.

Urban microclimate prediction is crucial for various fields, including Building Performance Simulation (BPS), outdoor thermal comfort, building life cycle, and residential health. Existing methods involve using classical weather file data, such as Typical Meteorological Years (TMY), or machine learning techniques for time-based forecasting. However, the incorporation of both spatial and temporal dimensions and land use/land cover (LULC) data is seldom considered. This paper proposes a novel approach to predict microclimate: the Geo-LSTM-Kriging model, which is applicable for fine-scale microclimate prediction within a few hundred meters around weather stations. The Geo-layer processes and learns from LULC data, the LSTM layer learns from historical data, and the Kriging layer extracts spatial distance information. This comprehensive combination integrates spatial, temporal, and environmental conditions, providing accurate results with higher spatial resolution (1 m \u00d7 1 m) and shorter time intervals (10 min). These prediction results were achieved by employing statistical downscaling calculation and utilizing data from 14 weather stations located within our university campus. Upon the analysis of these prediction results, we found that the proposed model can accurately predict temperature and humidity at high spatial and temporal resolution. Compared to traditional interpolation models, the RMSE of temperature decreases from 1.59 \u00b0C to 0.64 \u00b0C, and the RMSE of relative humidity (RH) decreases from 7.70 to 3.23.

A computational survey is initially introduced to decide the optimal set of building-stock clustering criteria among all possible combinations, involving the minimization of the RMSE index regarding the primary energy consumption of each building. For a representative building from each identified typology, the key performance indicators (KPIs) are computed for alternative energy-upgrading scenarios.

The methodology is applied for the case of the Municipality of Hersonissos in Greece. For the specific 44-buildings\u2019 stock it was found that the optimal clustering set included four criteria, building use, construction year, heating, and a cooling system, leading to 15 building typologies.

However, 30% of all Europeans live in rented property, where conflicting stakeholder interests arise. Landlords are responsible for renovation decisions (building envelope and energy system) and the corresponding investments. Tenants face rising rents and only slightly benefit from falling energy costs. The literature calls this conflict the landlord\u2013tenant dilemma.

Full text Figures and data Side by side Abstract eLife assessment Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods Data availability References Peer review Author response Article and author information Abstract Maturation and fine-tuning of neural circuits frequently require neuromodulatory signals that set the excitability threshold, neuronal connectivity, and synaptic strength. Here, we present a mechanistic study of how neuromodulator-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ signals, through the store-operated Ca2+ channel Orai, regulate intrinsic neuronal properties by control of developmental gene expression in flight-promoting central dopaminergic neurons (fpDANs). The fpDANs receive cholinergic inputs for release of dopamine at a central brain tripartite synapse that sustains flight (Sharma and Hasan, 2020). Cholinergic inputs act on the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor to stimulate intracellular Ca2+ release through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localised inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor followed by ER-store depletion and Orai-mediated store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Analysis of gene expression in fpDANs followed by genetic, cellular, and molecular studies identified Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry as a key regulator of excitability in fpDANs during circuit maturation. SOCE activates the transcription factor trithorax-like (Trl), which in turn drives expression of a set of genes, including Set2, that encodes a histone 3 lysine 36 methyltransferase (H3K36me3). Set2 function establishes a positive feedback loop, essential for receiving neuromodulatory cholinergic inputs and sustaining SOCE. Chromatin-modifying activity of Set2 changes the epigenetic status of fpDANs and drives expression of key ion channel and signalling genes that determine fpDAN activity. Loss of activity reduces the axonal arborisation of fpDANs within the MB lobe and prevents dopamine release required for the maintenance of long flight. eLife assessment In Drosophila melanogaster, the SOCE channel Orai is required for the development of flight-promoting dopaminergic neurons. The Hasan laboratory has previously shown that disabling Orai function impairs Drosophila flight due to aberrant neuronal development at the pupal stage. In this fundamental study, Mitra et al. show that SOCE drives a transcriptional feedback loop via the homeobox transcription factor, 'Trithorax-like' (Trl), and histone modifiers, Set2 and E(z), to regulate the expression of key genes required for the function of dopaminergic flight neurons, including the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. This solid study is carefully performed with validated methodology and most of the analyses are rigorous. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.88808.4.sa0 About eLife assessments Introduction Neural circuitry underlying mature adult behaviours emerges from a combination of developmental gene expression programs and experience-dependent neuronal activity. Holometabolous insects such as Drosophila reconfigure their nervous system during metamorphosis to generate circuitry capable of supporting adult behaviours (Levine, 1984). During pupal development, neurons undergo maturation of their electrical properties with a gradual increase in depolarising responses and consequent synaptic transmission (Hardie et al., 1993; J\u00e4rvilehto and Finell, 1983). Apart from voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and fast-acting neurotransmitters specific to ionotropic receptors, the developing nervous system also uses neuromodulators, which target metabotropic receptors, show slower response kinetics, and are capable of affecting a larger subset of neurons by means of diffusion-aided volumetric transmission (Taber and Hurley, 2014). Although neuromodulators alter intrinsic neuronal properties (Marder, 2012) by changes in gene expression, the molecular mechanisms through which this is achieved and maintained over developmental timescales needs further understanding. Ca2+ signals generated by neuronal activity can determine neurotransmitter specification (Spitzer, 2012), synaptic plasticity (O\u2019Hare et al., 2022; Takechi et al., 1998), patterns of neurite growth (Gu and Spitzer, 1995), and gene expression programs (Ciceri et al., 2022; Rosenberg and Spitzer, 2011) over developmental timescales (Arjun McKinney et al., 2022) where output specificity is defined by signal dynamics. Neuromodulators generate intracellular Ca2+ signals by stimulation of cognate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) linked to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and Ca2+ signalling pathway. IP3 transduces intracellular Ca2+ release through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localised ligand-gated ion channel, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R; Streb et al., 1984), followed by store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) through the plasma membrane localised Orai channel (Prakriya and Lewis, 2015; Thillaiappan et al., 2019). Cellular and physiological consequences of Ca2+ signals generated through SOCE exhibit different timescales and subcellular localisation from activity-induced signals, suggesting that they alter neuronal properties through novel mechanisms. Expression studies, genetics, and physiological analysis support a role for IP3/Ca2+ and SOCE in neuronal development and the regulation of adult neuronal physiology across organisms (Hasan and Sharma, 2020; Mitra and Hasan, 2022; Somasundaram et al., 2014). In Drosophila, neuromodulatory signals of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides stimulate cognate GPCRs on specific neurons to generate IP3 followed by intracellular Ca2+ release and SOCE (Agrawal et al., 2013; Megha and Hasan, 2017; Shakiryanova et al., 2011). Genetic and cellular studies identified neuromodulatory inputs and SOCE as an essential component for maturation of neural circuits for flight (Pathak et al., 2015; Venkiteswaran and Hasan, 2009). A focus of this flight deficit lies in a group of central dopaminergic neurons (DANs) that include the PPL1 and PPM3 DANs (Liu et al., 2012) marked by THD\u2019 GAL4, alternately referred to henceforth as flight-promoting DANs (fpDANs). Among the fpDANs, some PPL1 DANs project to the \u03b32\u03b1\u20191 lobe of the mushroom body (MB; Mao and Davis, 2009), a dense region of neuropil in the insect central brain, that forms a relay centre for flight (Sharma and Hasan, 2020). Axonal projections from Kenyon cells (KCs) carry sensory inputs (Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2017; Tsao et al., 2018; Yagi et al., 2016) and those from DANs carry internal state information (Mao and Davis, 2009; Riemensperger et al., 2005; Zolin et al., 2021) to functional compartments of the MB, where dopamine release modulates the KC and MB output neuron synapse (MBONs; Aso et al., 2014). The KC-DAN-MBON tripartite synapse carries a dynamically updating representation of the motivational and behavioural state of the animal (Aso and Rubin, 2016; Berry et al., 2015; Owald et al., 2015; Waddell, 2016). Here, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms that underlie the ability of neuromodulatory acetylcholine signals, acting through SOCE during circuit maturation, to determine fpDAN function required for Drosophila flight. Results A spatio-temporal requirement for SOCE determines flight To understand how neuromodulator-stimulated SOCE alters neuronal properties over developmental timescales, we began by refining further the existing spatio-temporal coordinates of SOCE requirement for flight. fpDANs with a requirement for SOCE have been identified earlier by expression of a dominant negative Orai transgene, which renders the channel Ca2+ impermeable, thus abrogating all SOCE as observed in primary neuronal cultures (OraiE180A; Figure 1A; Pathak et al., 2015; Yeromin et al., 2006). These include a smaller subset of THD\u2019GAL4 marked DANs, where acetylcholine promotes dopamine release through the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAchR) by stimulating IP3/Ca2+ signalling (Sharma and Hasan, 2020). OraiE180A expression in a subset of 21\u201323 DANs marked by THD\u2019 GAL4 (Figure 1B) led to complete loss of flight (Figure 1C) while overexpression of the wildtype Orai transgene had a relatively minor effect (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1). Figure 1 with 9 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry sets the gene expression profile of flight-promoting dopaminergic neurons (DANs) in late development and early adulthood.

Among these 16\u201319 DANs, two pairs of PPL1 DANs projecting to the \u03b32\u03b1\u20191 lobes of the MB (marked by the MB296B split GAL4 driver and schematised in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2; Aso et al., 2014; Aso and Rubin, 2016) were identified as contributing to the flight deficit to a significant extent (Figure 1C, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3). The MB296B DANs form part of a central flight relay centre identified earlier as requiring IP3/Ca2+ signalling (Sharma and Hasan, 2020). That the THD\u2019 neurons are required for flight was further confirmed by inhibiting their function. Acute activation of either a temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutant (Shibirets; Kitamoto, 2001), which blocks exocytosis at an elevated temperature, or acute expression of the tetanus toxin light chain fragment (TeTxLC; Sweeney et al., 1995), which cleaves Synaptobrevin, an essential component of the synaptic release machinery in THD\u2019 neurons, led to severe flight defects (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4). Previous work has demonstrated that intracellular Ca2+ release through the IP3R, which precedes SOCE (Figure 1A), is required during late pupal development in THD\u2019-marked DANs for flight (Pathak et al., 2015; Sharma and Hasan, 2020). The precise temporal requirement for SOCE in THD\u2019 neurons was investigated by inducing OraiE180A transgene expression for specific periods of pupal development and in adults with the tubulinGAL80ts-based temperature-sensitive expression system (TARGET \u2013 Temporal And Regional Gene Expression Targeting; McGuire et al., 2004). Approximately 100 hr of pupal development were binned into 24 hr windows, wherein SOCE was abrogated by OraiE180A expression, following which normal development and growth were permitted. Flies were assayed for flight 5 d post eclosion. Abrogation of SOCE by expression of the OraiE180A-dominant-negative transgene at 72\u201396 hr after puparium formation (APF) resulted in complete loss of flight compared to minor flight deficits observed upon expression of OraiE180A during earlier developmental windows (Figure 1D). Abrogation of flight also occurred upon OraiE180A expression during the first 2 d post-eclosion (see \u2018Discussion\u2019), whereas abrogation of SOCE 5 d after eclosion as adults resulted in only modest flight deficits (Figure 1D), indicating that SOCE is required for maturation of THD\u2019-marked flight DANs. Earlier work has shown that loss of SOCE by expression of OraiE180A does not alter the number of DANs or affect neurite projection patterns of PPL1 and PPM3 neurons (Pathak et al., 2015). Of these two clusters, PPM3 DANs project to the ellipsoid body in the central complex (Kong et al., 2010), and PPL1 DANs project to the MB and the lateral horn (Mao and Davis, 2009) and aid in the maintenance of extended flight bouts (Sharma and Hasan, 2020). Loss of SOCE in late pupae leads to a reorganisation of neuronal gene expression The molecular consequences of loss of SOCE in THD\u2019 neurons were investigated next by undertaking a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis from fluorescence-activated and sorted (FACS) THD\u2019 neurons with or without OraiE180A expression and marked with eGFP (Figure 1E, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5). THD\u2019 neurons were obtained from pupae at 72 \u00b1 6 hr APF (essential SOCE requirement for flight; Figure 1E). Expression analysis of RNA-seq libraries generated from THD\u2019 neurons revealed a reorganisation of the transcriptome upon loss of SOCE (Figure 1F). Expression of 822 genes was downregulated (with a fold change cut-off of < \u20131) as assessed using three different methods of differentially expressed genes (DEG) analysis (Figure 1G), whereas 137 genes were upregulated (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6). To understand whether loss of SOCE affects genes expressed in neurons from the pupal stage, we used the modEncode dataset (Celniker et al., 2009; modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010) to reconstruct developmental trajectories of all genes expressed in THD\u2019 neurons (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7). Using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, we classified genes expressed in THD\u2019 neurons into three clusters, where \u2018cluster 0\u2019 is low expression throughout development, \u2018cluster 1\u2019 exhibits a larval peak in expression, and \u2018cluster 2\u2019 exhibits a pupal peak in expression (Figure 1H). The majority of expressed genes (>95%) classify as low expression throughout (cluster 0) and were removed from further analysis. Genes belonging to either the downregulated gene set or the upregulated gene set in SOCE-deficient THD\u2019 neurons and a random set of genes were analysed further. A comparison of the proportion of DEGs classified in the larval and pupal clusters revealed that >75% of downregulated genes belonged to the pupal peak (cluster 2), whereas <20% of either the upregulated genes or a random set of genes classified as belonging to the larval peak (Figure 1I). Moreover, downregulated genes exhibit higher baseline expression in wildtype pupal THD\u2019 neurons (Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 8 and 9). These analyses suggest that SOCE induces expression of a set of genes in THD\u2019 neurons during the late pupal phase, which are subsequently required for flight. These are henceforth referred to as SOCE-responsive genes. SOCE regulates gene expression through a balance of histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of SOCE-responsive genes revealed \u2018Transcription\u2019, \u2018Ion transporters\u2019, \u2018Ca2+ dependent exocytosis\u2019, \u2018GPCRs\u2019, \u2018Synaptic components\u2019, and \u2018Kinases\u2019 as top GO categories (Figure 2A). Among these, \u2018Transcription\u2019 and \u2018Ion transporters\u2019 represented categories with the highest enrichment. Further analysis of genes that classified under \u2018Transcription\u2019 revealed SET domain-containing genes that encode histone lysine methyltransferases implicated in chromatin regulation and gene expression (Dillon et al., 2005), and among the SET domain-containing genes, Set1 and Set2 showed distinct downregulation (Figure 2B). One of these genes, the H3K36me3 methyltransferase Set2 (Figure 2C), was identified in a previous RNA-seq from larval neurons with loss of IP3R-mediated Ca2+ signalling (Mitra et al., 2020). RT-PCRs from sorted THD\u2019 neurons confirmed that Set2 levels are indeed downregulated (by 76%) in THD\u2019 neurons expressing OraiE180A and to the same extent as seen upon expression of Set2RNAi (79% downregulation; Figure 2C). Set1 and Set2 perform methyltransferase activity at H3K4 and H3K36 histone residues, respectively (Ardehali et al., 2011; Stabell et al., 2007). Both these markers are epigenetic signatures for transcriptional activation, where H3K4me3 is enriched at the 5\u2032 end of the gene body and H3K36me3 is enriched in the gene bodies of actively transcribed genes; schematised in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1. In the adult central nervous system (CNS), Set2, is expressed at fourfold higher levels compared to Set1 (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2; modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010). Set2 also shows a steep 5.5-fold increase in expression levels during the pupal to adult transition compared to a 2-fold increase in Set1 (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2). These observations, coupled with the previous report of Set2 function downstream of IP3R/Ca2+ signalling in larval glutamatergic neurons (Mitra et al., 2020), led us to pursue the role of Set2 in THD\u2019 neurons.

To understand the functional significance, if any, of downregulation of Set2 in THD\u2019 neurons upon loss of SOCE, four independent Set2 RNAi constructs were obtained. Knockdown of Set2 in THD\u2019 neurons with all four RNAi lines tested resulted in significant flight defects (Figure 2D, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3). Set2 function for flight was additionally verified in the PPL1 DANs projecting to the \u03b32\u03b1\u20191 lobe of the MB (MB296BGAL4; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4). To test the hypothesis that Set2 expression and function for flight is regulated by SOCE, we overexpressed Set2 in the OraiE180A background using GAL4-UAS-driven heterologous Set2WT expression or CRISPR-dCas9::VPR-driven overexpression (Gilbert et al., 2013) from the endogenous locus and measured flight (Figure 2D, data in purple and brown). Flies expressing OraiE180A in the THD\u2019 neurons, which are flightless, exhibit significant rescue in flight bout durations upon Set2 overexpression, through either method (Figure 2D, compare red with purple and brown data), but not upon expression of a control transgene, GCamP6m (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5, compare data in green and red). Although the Set2 overexpression rescues were induced all through development, because Orai function drives critical gene expression during 72\u201396 hr APF (Figure 1D), we concluded that Set2-mediated rescue is also likely to occur during this time window. These data taken together with downregulation of Set2 upon expression of OraiE180A (Figure 2C) support the hypothesis that SOCE-driven expression of Set2 in fpDANs is required for flight. That Set2 function downstream of SOCE occurs specifically through its methyltransferase activity was supported through experiments where knockdown of the demethylase Kdm4B, the primary histone demethylase expressed in these neurons (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6), rescued flight in THD\u2019>OraiEE180A flies (Figure 2D, data in pink). Knockdown of the lower expressed Drosophila H3K36 demethylase isoform, Kdm4A, did not show a similar rescue (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7, data in pink). Moreover, both Set2 depletion and loss of SOCE (THD\u2019>OraiEE180A) lead to a decrease in the normalised H3K36me3 signal in THD\u2019 neurons (Figure 2E). To understand whether deficient H3K36me3 is found in the SOCE-responsive genes, we quantified the enrichment of H3K36me3 at SOCE-responsive loci from an H3K36me3 ChIP-seq dataset (modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010) from wildtype adult heads (Figure 2F). We observed an enrichment of the H3K36me3 signal over the gene bodies of the SOCE-responsive genes (Figure 2F). Additionally, genes that were more affected by loss of SOCE (greater extent of downregulation) had a correspondingly higher H3K36me3 signal (Figure 2G) compared with a random set of genes (Figure 2G, data in gray), further indicating that one of the ways SOCE regulates gene expression is through Set2-mediated deposition of H3K36me3. The gene E(z) that encodes a component of the PRC2 complex (EZH2) which deposits H3K27me3 is upregulated upon loss of SOCE (Figure 2B), suggesting that SOCE could affect additional histone modifications. While H3K36me3 is a marker for transcriptional activation (Krogan et al., 2003), H3K27me3 is a repressive signature which silences transcription (Cai et al., 2021). These two marks are antagonistic as deduced from studies which have shown that deposition of H3K36me3 allosterically inhibits the Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC2), thereby preventing it from depositing the H3K27me3 signature at the same genomic loci (Finogenova et al., 2020). A comparison of H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 peaks over the 822 SOCE-responsive genes revealed a higher enrichment of H3K36me3 versus H3K27me3 in wildtype fly heads (Figure 2H; modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010), suggesting that robust expression of these genes in adult neurons occurs through an SOCE-dependent mechanism initiated in late pupae (schematised in Figure 2I). To test this hypothesis, we fed SOCE-deficient flies (THD\u2019GAL4>OraiEE180A) GSK343, a pharmacological inhibitor (Verma et al., 2012) of the EZH2 component of PRC2 that is known to reduce H3K27me3 chromatin marks and performed flight assays. Feeding of GSK343 lead to partial rescue of flight in THD\u2019>OraiEE180A flies in a dose-dependent manner with maximal flight bout durations of up to 400 s (Figure 2J, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 8). Normal cellular responses of PPL1 DANs require Orai-mediated SOCE and H3K36 trimethylation Next we investigated Ca2+ responses in SOCE and H3K36 trimethylation-deficient THD\u2019 PPL1 DANs upon stimulation with a neuromodulatory signal for the mAChR. It is known that THD\u2019-marked PPL1 DANs receive cholinergic inputs that stimulate store Ca2+ release through the IP3R, leading to SOCE through Orai (Figure 3A; Ebihara et al., 2006; Sharma and Hasan, 2020). In support of this idea, either expression of OraiE180A or knockdown of the IP3R attenuated the composite ER-Ca2+ release plus SOCE response to carbachol (CCh), a mAChR agonist, in PPL1 DANs (Figure 3B\u2013D, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1). Ex vivo brain preparations used here for in situ Ca2+ imaging of fpDANs are not viable in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Hence, measurement of store-Ca2+ release and SOCE independent of each other was not possible. Importantly, knockdown of Set2 also abrogated the Ca2+ response to CCh (Figure 3B\u2013D), whereas overexpression of a transgene encoding Set2 in THD\u2019 neurons either with loss of SOCE (OraiE180A) or with knockdown of the IP3R (itprRNAi) leads to significant rescue of the Ca2+ response, indicating that Set2 is required downstream of SOCE (Figure 3B\u2013D) and IP3/Ca2+ signalling (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1).

It is relatively well-known how the different factors work separately, but how they work together, especially near water bodies, is still unclear. This paper investigates the effects of blue bodies (rivers or large lakes), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), building coverage (BC), and building height (BH) on the land surface temperature (LST), comparing the situation around lakes and a river. Their inter-relationships are explored in a square grid of 30 \u00d7 30 m using Landsat-8 data on LST measurements in Prague, Czech Republic, in summer 2022. Multiple regression models are used for the analysis. The results imply that the NDVI significantly reduces LSTs, followed rivers if within 200 m of one, while the effect of lakes is negligible. The effect of BH is low. BC is a predominant factor in the city, generating a warming effect, which increases with the city\u2019s compactness. The main planning implications are to base urban heat island mitigation strategies on compensating for building coverage with live and dense green bodies, promoting vertical development.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391362835"}}

The construction of these public streetlights also consumes the city's electricity resources. Efficiency measures are needed to reduce the use of electricity for public streetlights. We propose this research using smart lighting technology. This device will detect human and vehicle movements, time settings, and step dimming that allows dynamic lighting and dimming.

This device will be equipped with PIR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and light sensors. With the development of Internet of Things technology currently, it is expected to help control remotely and have an integrated system. The control and monitoring system is connected via the internet. The parameters to be controlled are the presence of humans, vehicles, and lighting, and all these parameters can be monitored with web-based and Android applications. Based on the above studies, this research will design a public streetlight system using a Data Control Unit (DCU) to facilitate the control system, and this device will be integrated with sensors such as human sensors (PIR), light sensors, and ultrasonic sensors.

Introduction: South Africa is ranked among the 20 highest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters worldwide, mainly due to its heavy reliance on coal for energy. The residential building industry can play a significant role towards the minimization of both GHG emissions and energy consumption. This research assesses the beneficial impacts of utilizing wall envelope insulation measures using five insulation materials, for a detached residential building, within the seven energy zones of South Africa in accordance with the South African National code for Building energy efficiency (SANS10400-XA). Methods: Lifecycle analysis (for 50 years), regression methods and sequential search techniques of building energy modelling were used to determine both the energy saving implications of adopting the insulation materials (at various levels of thickness), and their corresponding energy payback periods. The study area consisted of eight selected locations representing all the seven energy zones in South Africa (Welkom, Witbank, Thohoyandou, Cape Town, Pretoria, Ixopo, Sutherland, and Fraserburg). Results: Sutherland (zone 6), Cape Town (zone 4) and Fraserburg (zone 7) benefitted most from energy savings due to application of insulation measures. Witbank (Zone 2), Thohoyandou (zone 3) and Pretoria (zone 5) never benefitted from application of wall envelope insulation (in terms of energy savings). Cellulose and straw yielded the lowest payback periods. Generally, polyurethane yielded the highest net energy savings at lower insulation thickness levels, while cellulose was preferable at higher insulation thickness levels in Welkom (zone1) Cape Town (zone 4), Ixopo (zone 5H), Sutherland (zone 6) and Fraserburg (zone 7). Discussion: Lower optimal wall envelope insulation thicknesses (that maximized energy savings) appeared to correspond to locations with higher annual temperature ranges. Higher temperature ranges (hence, higher degree days) would ensure that more energy is saved in order to keep the indoor temperatures within the acceptable comfort limits, due to application of insulation. However, the selection of insulation material is also influenced by other factors such as resistance to insect and mould attack (which easily affect bio-insulation materials), fire retardancy, durability (which affects cellulose), sound proofing, structural strength, and resistance to water vapour.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391172341"}}

Visible light positioning (VLP), leveraging visible light communications (VLC), becomes a promising indoor positioning technology due to its high accuracy and low cost. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of VLP systems. In particular, since VLC lays the foundation for VLP, we first present a detailed overview of the principles of VLC. The performance of each positioning algorithm is also compared in terms of various metrics such as accuracy, coverage, and orientation limitation. Beyond the physical layer studies, the network design for a VLP system is also investigated, including multi-access technologies resource allocation, and light-emitting diode (LED) placements. Next, the applications of the VLP systems are overviewed. Finally, this paper outlines open issues, challenges, and future research directions for the research field. In a nutshell, this paper constitutes the first holistic survey on VLP from state-of-the-art studies to practical uses.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391272363"}}

Due to urbanization and growing density in cities in the past century, metrics were introduced to assess daylight performance such as minimum sunlight hours and the daylight factor. The paper initially explores the shortcomings of early-stage daylight and sunlight evaluation methods. A novel methodology called Sunlight Autonomy (SA) is proposed for evaluating sunlight performance in buildings. The SA is based on the \u201cExposure to sunlight\u201d criteria in EN 170307 \u201cDaylight in Buildings,\u201d where a computational method is used for the evaluation on a specified day. The SA concept expands the analysis temporally over the entire year, and spatially on building facades, leading to new metrics for a point of evaluation, and spatial metrics for buildings. The SA methodology is analyzed in a case study across four European cities. The SA metrics on facades between February 1st and March 21st, days in EN 17037, led to differences up to 63%. This revealed a significant shortcoming in EN 17037, relevant for Nordic regions. The differences of spatial metrics between March 21st and 50% of the year were within 5%, and up to 33% between February 1st and 75% of the year. The timestep affects the metrics and a window evaluation showed that the error of a 10-minute analysis was within 5% of daily insolation and 5 days for the annual SA. The potential of these metrics for urban planning and the architectural design process is examined. The interaction between SA and EN 17037, as well as other ongoing research developments, is discussed.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391130803"}}

To prevent damage to human life and health caused by high temperatures and extreme weather and to promote sustainable urban development, it is necessary to optimize the layout of urban development elements to improve the urban wind\u2013heat environment. Taking the high-density urban area of Shanghai as an example, this study used wavelet analysis to investigate the cyclic changes of the average annual temperature of Shanghai from 1950 to 2022 and the average annual wind speed of Shanghai from 2000 to 2020. The correlation between the urban heat environment and the urban development elements was analyzed using geographically weighted regression. The correlation was then examined using BP neural network, and finally, the impacts of different urban spatial patterns on the wind environment were analyzed using CFD numerical simulation. The results show that the average annual temperature of Shanghai city has an overall upward trend, with significant cycles of 44 and 32 years that are shortening over time. The average annual wind speed has a downward trend, with a significant main cycle of 22 years. Greening and water coverage, as well as the floor area ratio, have a significant reducing effect on surface temperature, whereas building density is positively correlated with surface temperature. Building density has a significant reducing effect on wind speed, whereas the effect of floor area ratio is not significant. The effect of building density on wind speed is significantly weakened, whereas the effect of the floor area ratio is not significant. This study provides valuable references for Shanghai and other high-density cities to optimize urban spatial patterns in order to improve the safety and comfort of the urban wind\u2013heat environments.

Abstract The significant influence of urban development on land surface temperature (LST) was always evident. Here, a study of the temperature increases in Hisar city from 1991 to 2022 was conducted using Landsat data. The extent of thermal comfort in Hisar based on the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) was also evaluated. A land-use change map was used to calculate land-cover change, the NDVI was used to calculate vegetation coverage, and the NDBI was used to assess building cover. Over time, the UHI effect over Hisar city has significantly increased. It was found that built-up areas greatly affected the LST, especially at greater built-up densities. From 1991 to 2022, the minimum LST increased from 17.02\u00b0C to 37.40\u00b0C. Additionally, the highest temperature in 2022 increased to 47.24\u00b0C from 30.00\u00b0C in 1991. An inverse correlation was found between the LST and NDVI, which indicates that greenery has a debilitating effect on urban temperatures. However, the NDBI and LST, are positively correlated, indicating that urbanization intensifies the LST and causes the creation of urban heat islands (UHIs). The level of comfort for urban residents decreased during 1991\u20132022.

These systems possess the potential to enhance the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of buildings. This study seeks to explore the impact of living walls on the energy performance of buildings, specifically investigating the influence of a living-walled urban block on the ambient air temperature and its subsequent effect on building energy consumption. By comparing the cooling energy consumption of two typical buildings situated in Shiraz, southern Iran, with varying levels of greenery in different microclimates, we further ascertain the effectiveness of living walls in reducing energy consumption. To conduct this analysis, we employed coupled simulations utilizing EnergyPlus and Envi-met, which incorporated both the outdoor microclimate and the cooling energy consumption of the buildings. The urban block under consideration consisted of 48 three-story buildings (Case A) and five-story buildings (Case B) within a site measuring 120 m \u00d7 150 m. Our findings substantiate that the implementation of a living wall system can lower the ambient air temperature by a significant extent, with an average decrease of 1.35 \u00b0C and a maximum decrease of 2.25 \u00b0C.

Providing adequate indoor environmental quality is crucial in educational settings. In this paper, we implemented and tested a framework that collects occupant feedback and investigated correlations between teachers comfort and the operational characteristics of an Austrian school building in September and October 2022. Initial results show that the measured average temperatures (23.1 t-25.1 deg C) in all rooms are on the upper limit of various recommendations, such as comfort guidelines for building operation or workplace regulations. This assessment is in line with the feedback we received from the teachers. A literature review demonstrated that childrens comfort temperatures are lower compared to adults. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that indoor temperatures during the survey period were inadequate for the pupils either, even without direct feedback. An analysis of the CO2 measurements showed that, during school hours, approximately 20% of all measurement values were above 1000 ppm, with 2% above 1500 ppm. CO2 levels above 1000 ppm are considered hygienically critical, with the latest research proposing to lower the limits below 800 ppm to ensure a healthy and effective learning environment. While we only assessed the challenges of providing a healthy indoor environment for an educational building in Austria, our literature review shows similar challenges and research efforts worldwide. Our analysis demonstrates the need for adapting design requirements, especially for school buildings, acknowledging the different comfort needs of adults and children and the importance of high indoor air quality for providing an optimum learning environment.

The Thermal Sensation Vote (TSV) and other important data were collected through the surveys, including the effect of wind on thermal comfort. An adaptive model incorporating solar and wind effects was evaluated using multiple linear regression techniques and RStudio. Three models were used to evaluate thermal comfort, including the adaptive one. Numerous models were compared and evaluated in order to select the best one. It was found that the adaptive model (Model 1) was deemed to be the best model for its application.

Urban spatial patterns are quantified using five landscape metrics that capture the spatial arrangement of urban footprints and greenspaces, along with a polycentricity index that measures the distribution of human activities. The results indicate that certain features of urban fabric, including fragmentation, mixed land use, and regular-shaped urban patches, have the potential to mitigate the UHI effect. Moreover, dispersing multiple smaller greenspaces throughout the urban area demonstrates a greater cooling effect compared to having a single large and more aggregated park. In addition, our analysis reveals that a doubling (100%) of the polycentricity degree corresponds to a significant decrease in both day- and night-time UHI effects, with reductions of 10.4% and 24.6%, respectively. This study confirms that polycentric development yields greater benefits in reducing urban heat for large-sized city regions compared to medium- and small-sized ones; and its effectiveness is mostly pronounced near urban center(s).

To ensure that the novel dynamic PCM wall structure could reach its full potential, the thermal performance of the structure was numerically simulated and optimized based on different climatic conditions, room sizes and the position of PCM layer in the wall.

Among the four cities of Harbin, Tianjin, Jinan and Guangzhou, northern cities, like Tianjin, were more suitable for using PCM A16 than southern cities. In terms of room size design, when the volume of the room remained identical, the room size design formed a certain correlation with the indoor temperature.

In office buildings, daylight is an important natural resource, as it is profusely available during occupied hours. However, its use can increase energy consumption for air conditioning. Therefore, combining this resource with side lighting systems and promoting its integration with electric lighting is essential to obtain an energy balance. This paper aims to analyze daylight performance and the energy consumption for lighting and air conditioning considering four types of glazing, four orientations, from window-to-wall ratios varying between 40% to 100% for bare and shaded window models in an office room located in a subtropical city in southern Brazil. The methodology was based on Useful Daylight Illuminance levels of 500 to 2,500 lx, Daylight Autonomy levels of 500 lx, and total energy consumption through simulation in DesignBuilder software. The results showed that L13 glazing is not recommended for bare and shaded windows, regardless of window orientation. M76 presented the best performance for energy consumption for West shaded windows. For the West, shading is necessary irrespective of the glazing type (except L13, whose best performance is for bare windows) from WWR 50%. M76 and M52 had the lowest total energy consumption. The findings of this study add to an understanding of the energy savings and lighting performance of different types of glazing, combined with window apertures, and solar orientations for a subtropical climate. Furthermore, the study shows that the choice of glazing depends not only on the presence of shading but also on the orientation and WWR, without a linear behavior.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4391262954"}}

As modern cities are increasingly affected by rapid urban expansion and unpredictable climate change, effective water conservation and management is ever increasing in importance both economically and environmentally. Vegetated or \u201cGreen\u201d roof covers are an unconventional yet highly effective method of decreasing rainfall runoff in the residential, commercial and industrial landscape. Through their installation the severity of stormwater overflow is decreased both through structural and ecological damage. This report aims to explore existing foreign Green Roof methodology whilst incorporating climatic, ecological and structural considerations specific to the Eastern Australian region. Through water mass balance of a chosen extensive Green Roof system, and selection of several suitable plant and soil types; an optimal design with respect to water retention and aesthetic value was found. Hardy ground covers such a grasses, turfs and sedums were found to be the most suitable for Australian Green Roofs as they require minimal depth of soil strata to be sustained throughout the year and can survive without irrigation. A shallow substrate of loam soil was found to be the most suitable for water retention, survival of plants and lightweight for the extensive system which suits Australian Construction methods. Green Roofs as a method of improving the quality of amenity, stormwater and pollution management and construction in inner city and suburban environments have been proven to be transferable from foreign roots to application in the Eastern Australian environment.

This study, conducted in the city of Erzurum in Turkey, delves into the complex relationship between urban morphology and UHI intensity in different housing areas with distinct microclimates, focusing particularly on street networks, building systems, and land use. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationships between morphological indicators and UHIs in different housing areas. Key findings include that (1) noticeable UHI effects were observed, especially in dense areas with high-rise buildings.

Abstract Using green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) is the main method of greening and cooling high-density blocks. Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of a single GSI on thermal comfort on sunny days. However, GSI often occurs in combinations, and assessment of GSI cannot ignore the effect of rainwater on the thermal comfort improvement. Therefore, based on measured data of a real urban area of Nanjing, China, this study used 45 GSI single and combination simulation scenarios and three local climate zone (LCZ) baseline scenarios to compare and analyze three high-density blocks in the city. The physiological equivalent temperature (PET) was calculated using the ENVI-met specification to evaluate outdoor thermal comfort. The study produced the following results. (1) To improve outdoor thermal comfort, compact high-rise and mid-rise areas require more abundant GSI combinations, but only using a single GSI can have a good effect in compact low-rise area. (2) In extreme high-temperature weather, rainfall is a necessary condition for improvement of thermal comfort by GSI, and complex GSI can extend the thermal comfort improvement time following rainfall by more than 1 hour. (3) To improve the thermal comfort of a potential area of outdoor crowd activity to the greatest extent, shading and tree setting should be added based on the premise of increasing the combinations of GSI, and the efficiency of improvement can reach as high as 54.23%. The results of the study indicated that future GSI construction in high-density blocks should focus on different combinations of GSI based on different LCZs.

These effects were largely moderated by personal norms, indicating the importance of activating normative motivations to increase thermal comfort. Occupants with negative expectations improved their perceptions of the fan when making personal adjustments to stay comfortable. However, this effect was not moderated by personal norms.

This calls for a more applied approach to teaching about ET that connects concepts to experience for improved educational outcomes. One such opportunity exists at the intersections between ET and heat in cities, where a growing majority of the world&rsquo;s population lives, including many of our students. In this work we describe an ET educational activity that integrates theory with practical design, taking advantage of the close link between ET processes and urban heat patterns. In a benchtop experiment, students measure ET variations across common land surfaces (e.g., asphalt, grass, and mulch) through water and energy balance approaches. The experiment is paired with an &ldquo;urban heat tour&rdquo; in the campus environment, facilitated by portable infrared cameras, offering firsthand observation of urban heat patterns. These two activities, together, provide context in which students can understand the difference in ET across various land covers, describe the relationship between ET and land surface temperatures, and explain the impacts of urban design on heat dynamics. The activities are adaptable to serve a diversity of student backgrounds and to different educational contexts, including public demonstrations and K-12 classrooms.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4390901460"}}

Sustainable rainwater management may counteract the effects of climate change and significantly improve the distorted water balance in urbanized catchments.

This paper presents an assessment of the financial aspects, i.e., the cost-efficiency and economic feasibility, of various designs of rainwater management for a small-scale urban housing community in Lublin, Poland. The research was performed for a housing community covering approx. 1.38 ha and five multi-family residential buildings. The proposed designs covered rainwater harvesting systems, supported with extensive green roofs, with rainwater retained in underground or above-ground reservoirs, used with variable demand for watering the green areas and for underground parking lot flushing. For each designed variant, the investment as well as operation and maintenance costs were estimated. The assessment of the cost-efficiency and profitability of the proposed rainwater management systems was based on three indicators: Dynamic Generation Costs, Payback Period and Benefits\u2013Costs Ratio. The performed calculations showed that only two designs, utilizing above-ground rainwater reservoirs, could be assessed as economically profitable. Thus, local communities may be unable to financially sustain investments in sustainable rainwater management, so it seems that financial support is required.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4390906550"}}

Thus, a comprehensive analysis of the spatial explanatory variables (SEVs) and SUHII among urban and suburban areas is highly needed. Here, using the long-term satellite observations, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of SUHII in different temporal intervals (i.e. seasonal and diurnal) and the contribution of SEVs in urban and suburban areas. Our results indicate that SUHII shows predominantly increasing trend from 2012\u20132021 in cities of China.

If the microclimate deviates significantly from this, large amounts of cooling energy may be required to create a comfortable interior environment. In this study, single-family houses were randomly selected in two well-planned cities in Malaysia, with 30% of the houses located in Putrajaya and 70% in Shah Alam. Most of the houses used a modern tropical building style to adapt to the challenging tropical climate with high temperatures, high humidity, and heavy downpours.

The urban built environment, comprising structures, roads, and various facilities, plays a key role in the formation of urban heat islands, which inflict considerable damage upon human society. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in urban areas characterized by the rapid growth and concentration of populations, a global trend, notably exemplified in megacities such as Bangkok, Thailand. The global trend of urbanization has witnessed unprecedented growth in recent decades, with cities transforming into megametropolises that profoundly impact changes in urban temperature, specifically the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon induced by the rapid growth of urban areas. Elevated urban concentrations lead to increased city density, contributing to higher temperatures within the urban environment compared to the surrounding areas. The evolving land-use surface has assumed heightened significance due to urban development, necessitating accelerated efforts to mitigate urban heat islands. This study aims to quantify the influence of urban growth on urban surface temperature in Bangkok and its surrounding areas. The inverse relationship between urban temperature and land surface temperature (LST), coupled with urban area density, was examined using Landsat 5 and 8 satellite imagery. The analysis revealed a positive correlation between higher temperatures and levels of urban growth. Areas characterized by high-rise structures and economic activities experienced the most pronounced impact of the heat island phenomenon. The city exhibited a notable correlation between high density and high temperatures (high\u2013high), signifying that increased density contributes to elevated temperatures due to heat dissipation (significant correlation of R2 = 0.8582). Conversely, low-temperature, low-density cities (low\u2013low) with a dispersed layout demonstrated effective cooling of the surrounding area, resulting in a significant correlation with lower local temperatures (R2 = 0.7404). These findings provide valuable insights to assist governments and related agencies in expediting planning and policy development aimed at reducing heat in urban areas and steering sustainable urban development.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4390831373"}}

The predicted mean vote (PMV) model for residential outdoor spaces was calculated using simulation data for the hottest day of the summer to assess outdoor thermal comfort. By comparing the alternatives, including diagonal blocks, compact linear blocks, continuous curved blocks and dispersed cubic blocks, the microclimate performance of the diagonal type was better than the other design options, as the PMV index was the least distance from the ideal thermal comfort range due to a lower sky view factor (SVF) and optimal orientation. The curved blocks performed better in urban open spaces to promote airflow and reduce UHI than linear and cubic blocks. The results showed that the PMV index can predict thermal comfort in various urban design patterns and could be affected by the morphology of urban blocks.

In arid climates, a significant portion of the urban peak energy demand is dedicated to cooling and air-conditioning during the summer. The rapid urbanization rates in developing countries, particularly in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), have intensified the pressure on energy resources to meet the indoor comfort needs of residents. As a result, there has been a substantial increase in energy demand, with a 2.3% rise recorded in 2018. Electricity consumption in residential buildings accounted for over 48.6% of the total electricity consumption. The choice of building fabrics used in a residential building can significantly impact the building\u2019s passive performance and carbon footprint. This study aimed to enhance our understanding of how specific fabric details influence cooling energy usage in arid climates. To achieve this, a validation simulation model was initially created as a base case for a residential housing typology in Al Ain, UAE. This was followed by a parametric energy evaluation of various building envelope features. The evaluation was based on the reduction of yearly cooling load energy. The simulation results indicate that incorporating 50 mm of expanded polystyrene insulation into the outside walls significantly reduced energy consumption for cooling requirements in the arid UAE climate. Furthermore, no substantial difference was observed in the various roofing choices, including cool and green roofs, gravels, and sand roofs. Additionally, we concluded that the total solar energy transmittance (g-value) of windows played a more significant role than thermal transmittance (U-value) in reducing solar heat gain within the spaces.

To quantify thermal stress, specific indices have been proposed that depend on air temperature, mean radiant temperature (MRT), wind speed, and relative humidity. While temperature and humidity vary on scales of hundreds of meters, MRT and wind speed are strongly affected by individual buildings and trees, and vary at the meter scale. Therefore, most numerical thermal comfort studies apply micro-scale models to limited spatial domains (commonly representing urban neighborhoods with building blocks) with resolutions on the order of 1 m and a few hours of simulation. This prevents the analysis of the impact of city-scale adaptation/mitigation strategies on thermal stress and comfort. To solve this problem, we develop a methodology to estimate thermal stress indicators and their subgrid variability in mesoscale models &ndash; here applied to the multilayer urban canopy parametrization BEP-BEM within the WRF model. The new scheme (consisting of three main steps) can readily assess intra-neighborhood scale heat stress distributions across whole cities and for time scales of minutes to years. The first key component of the approach is the estimation of MRT in several locations within streets for different street orientations. Second, mean wind speed, and its subgrid variability, are parameterized as a function of the local urban morphology based on relations derived from a set of microscale LES and RANS simulations across a wide range of realistic and idealized urban morphologies. Lastly, we compute the distributions of two thermal stress indices for each grid square combining all the subgrid values of MRT, wind speed, air temperature, and absolute humidity. From these distributions, we quantify the high and low tails of the heat stress distribution in each grid square across the city, representing the thermal diversity experienced in street canyons. In this contribution, we present the core methodology as well as simulation results for Madrid (Spain), which illustrate strong differences between heat stress indices and common heat metrics like air or surface temperature, both across the city and over the diurnal cycle.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4390702083"}}

Furthermore, to reduce the embodied carbon impact of the building, the refurbishment measures need to consider the use of low-carbon building materials. This paper investigates ways to thermally future-proof typical Libyan houses using biobased materials. Several typical Libyan houses were monitored for one year to investigate the heating and cooling energy use and to thermally retrofit the building envelope.

The effect of light on hospital users was investigated in this article; therefore, it is important to understand both natural and artificial light sources in this regard. Natural light has many benefits for humans, and when it comes to electricity consumption, it is the best method because it is a free source; but, since natural light is not always available and cannot be used throughout the day, there is a need to have an artificial light source that gives the best lighting effect in terms of visual comfort and visual performance for users.

The building studied in this paper is located in the city of Turpan, where the problem of excessive energy use among buildings is significant due to the region\u2019s hot summers and cold winters. Additionally, the fact that the office building studied in this paper has an east\u2013west orientation is significant: the building\u2019s main fa\u00e7ade is oriented to the west, comprising a large area of single-layer glass curtain wall. Based on this, this paper proposes optimization strategies from two perspectives of renovation and new construction. Four design options are proposed at the retrofit level: glazed circular curtain wall; glazed enclosed curtain wall; west-facing double-glazed curtain wall circulation combined with south-facing light from the east; recycling of windows on the inside of the exterior glass curtain wall. These suggestions focus on retrofitting the glass curtain wall on the west elevation of the building. Two design options are proposed at the new-build level: west-facing south-oriented light and west-facing north-oriented light. These suggestions were primarily built around the idea of changing the orientation of the windows on the west elevation. The results show that the optimal solution is to implement the west-facing double-glazed curtain wall circulation combined with south-facing light from the east.

In this paper, the development of a general procedure that combines building and bioheat simulations to evaluate overheating risk in schools and generate health-based overheating limit criteria that may be applied in Canadian schools is described. General school building models, having either old or new constructions, were created based on a primary school building and successfully calibrated using field measurements of indoor temperature and humidity and published building energy use intensity data. Three sets of two limit criteria (exposure duration and severity of overheating) that account for the personal exposure conditions of students in primary, middle, and secondary schools were developed by limiting the body dehydration of students during extreme overheating events. Comparing the proposed limit criteria with the hour of exceedance criterion revealed interesting relationships between them, suggesting the proposed limit criteria as a benchmark for the comfort-based criteria, particularly for the more vulnerable primary and middle schools.

This scoping review aims to identify built environment audits of pedestrian environments developed for use during a specific weather condition or season. Secondly, this review aims to investigate gaps in the inclusion of relevant weather mitigating built environment features in pedestrian environment audit tools. Methods Following a standard protocol, a systematic search was executed in CINAHL, Medline and Web of Science to identify built environment audit tools of pedestrian spaces. Studies were screened, and data were extracted from selected documents by two independent reviewers (e.g., psychometric properties and audit items included). Audit items were screened for the inclusion of weather mitigating built environment features, and the tool\u2019s capacity to measure temperature, precipitation, seasonal and sustainability impacts on pedestrians was calculated. Results The search returned 2823 documents. After screening and full text review, 27 articles were included. No tool was found that was developed specifically for use during a specific weather condition or season. Additionally, gaps in the inclusion of weather mitigating items were found for all review dimensions (temperature, precipitation, seasonal, and sustainability items).

The study is objectively difficult due to the large dynamics like land cover and the considerable diversity of land use patterns in urban areas. Various approaches and methods are used in research practice, based both on ground measurements and in the use of remote methods and satellite information. However, most of these approaches provide information with problematic spatial and temporal resolution, making them difficult to apply for sustainable urban planning purposes, which require adequate information provision. This paper presents the results of the application of thermal photogrammetry based on the use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), combined with geographic information systems (GIS), in the study of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHI), at the local level for the largest housing complex in Bulgaria - Lyulin district of the capital of Sofia city. The studies were carried out during a heat wave in July 2023. A difference of 16.5oC was found between locations with SUHI occurrence and suburban areas. The information benefits of locally addressed data and their direct applicability are discussed to support decision-making processes in the planning and management of urban areas, including their climate adaptation and sustainable development.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4390685764"}}

The junction between the roof and the external wall is a sensitive area within the building envelope; here, increased heat flow often takes place. In the case of partitions insulated with materials based on plant ingredients, thermal bridges are particularly dangerous due to the possibility of condensation and, consequently, mold. The present article analyzed the connection of the roof with the knee wall made of a hemp\u2013lime composite and the ridge in terms of the occurrence of thermal bridges. The following factors that may affect heat transfer in the junction were taken into account: the location of the load-bearing wooden frame, the roof slope, and the presence of internal plaster in the junction. Two-dimensional heat transfer analysis was performed based on the finite element method using THERM 7.4 software. All of the studied thermal bridges had \u03c8 values below 0.10 W/(m\u00b7K). Calculations of heat losses through a roof with different slopes were also presented, taking into account the considered thermal bridges. As the roof slope decreases, the heat flow through the roof decreases, despite the increasing value of the linear thermal transmittance. The share of the considered thermal bridges in the total heat loss from the roof reached up to 15%. To verify the obtained results, in further analysis, it would be necessary to calculate the impact of the roof\u2013knee wall bridge variants on heat losses throughout the entire building.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4390774306"}}

This study explores the relationship between street design and urban microclimate, aiming to propose a range of design strategies that can significantly improve thermal comfort within the street environment in Shenzhen, China. These design strategies hold immense potential for urban greening implementation and provide valuable insights to enhance the overall thermal quality of streetscapes in subtropical cities. The study employs landscape design and environmental simulation methods to evaluate the different design scenarios for the streetscape. The landscape design encompasses three scenarios with revised interventions: 1. the incorporation of building greening and enhanced pavement material albedo; 2. the introduction of trees and grass at the ground level; and 3. a combination of scenarios 1 and 2. Environmental simulations are utilized to assess the effectiveness of each design scenario. The findings reveal that increasing urban vegetation leads to a reduction in urban heat and significantly improves outdoor thermal comfort.

The urban outdoor thermal environment also influences the urban physical environment. Both the thermal environment and air environment have important effects on the subjective comfort evaluations of people. In this study, four typical spaces on a university campus in Xi'an, China, were selected to investigate the thermal environment and air environment in outdoor spaces. The particulate matter in the air was divided into three different concentrations. The adaptive thermal comfort due to the interaction between the outdoor thermal environment and air pollution was studied based on questionnaires and field measurements, and a strategy was developed for optimizing the thermal comfort of outdoor public space environments. The results showed that the influence of the thermal air quality environment on subjective comfort clearly varied among different spaces. The influence of haze pollution on subjective comfort was greater in high and low temperature environments, but less obvious in a moderate temperature environment. When the PM2.5 particle concentration was greater than 100 \u00b5g/m 3 , the evaluation of respiratory comfort was low in the high temperature environment.

Six composite substrates were prepared, respectively, by mixing peat with small-, medium-, and large-sized crushed bricks and crushed concrete particles (peat-to-inorganic-particle volume ratio of 1:2). The properties of each group were within acceptable parameters, with the crushed brick substrates displaying lower bulk density and higher porosity compared to the crushed concrete substrates. Seldom lineare was selected for the experiments, and the substrate thickness was set at 10 cm. Under the simulated drought conditions, the growth and stress resistance of Seldom lineare in the crushed brick substrates was similar to that in the conventional substrates and poorer in the crushed concrete substrates. Seldom lineare in medium-particle-size brick substrates performed the best, surpassing the traditional group. The growth of Seldom lineare in the small-particle-size concrete substrates was the worst. In the rooftop environment, all groups could support Seldom lineare over 180 days without maintenance, with an overall coverage of more than 60%.

In this study, four different forms of alleys were selected in Huangwu Village, located in the Zengcheng District, Guangzhou, as representative of summer microclimate measurements: common alleys, alleys with different shading facilities, and alleys with various surrounding building heights. After the simplified simulation model was verified in ENVI-met software, two sets of parameter-based models were created for the simulation by changing the aspect ratio (H/W), orientation of alleys, width of shading facilities, and height of surrounding buildings. Physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) was adopted to evaluate the simulation results and summarize the impacts and favorable ranges of different changes in pedestrian thermal comfort. The results indicate the following. (a) When H/W was lower than 1.5, the PET intensity of pedestrians in the alleys increased significantly. (b) In village alleys, orientation significantly influenced the thermal comfort of pedestrians. (c) In alleys with shading facilities, a shading width of 1 m was the best option.

Prefabricated buildings are increasingly popular worldwide, driven by technological advancements and the demand for sustainable and energy-efficient construction. However, the thermal performance of typical multi-layered and compacted prefabricated wall panels remains uncertain, leading to overdesigned HVAC and building envelope systems. This results in higher utility bills, unnecessary expenses, and increased material, labor, and transportation costs. While experimental analysis and computational simulations have proven effective for measuring the thermal performance of on-site wall panels (e.g., precast concrete, masonry), their effectiveness for exterior insulation finishing system (EIFS) prefab wall panels is unclear. This study aims to test the hypothesis that both experimental and computational analyses accurately measure the thermal performance of EIFS prefab wall panels under various climate conditions and yield to similar results. To achieve this, (1) experimental test analysis was conducted in an environmental chamber based on ASTM C1363 and ISO 8990 standards, and (2) computational simulation was conducted by employing THERM\u00ae at hot (65 \u00b0C) and cold (-16 \u00b0C) climates.

The current prevalence of overheating is presented based on monitored indoor temperatures in 50 Irish low-energy nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB), including 37 passive house (PH) across rural, town and urban settings and seven typology groupings. Objective overheating standards were used; (i) CIBSE TM59, (ii) Passive House (PH) and (iii) World Health Organisation (WHO) in addition to Occupant Satisfaction Surveys (OSS) and interviews. 26% of newbuilds overheated according to CIBSE TM59 (required by Irish Building Regulations) with 48% of average temperatures exceeding WHO recommended at least 10% of the year, and 26% for more than 20% of the year. Only 3% PH\u2019s failed the PH criteria and only 5% of retrofit failed. There was considerable disparity between the results of the three standards with residences failing CIBSE yet passing PHPP overheating criteria (and vice versa). A key disparity is the \u2018room by room\u2019 analysis of overheating (CIBSE and WHO) compared with building-wide criteria (PH), especially noticeable in bedrooms. Poorly installed/commissioned heat pump systems and lack of control e.g. little external shading and window restrictors impeded regulation of overheating. A focused national strategy on overheating is recommended given the unprecedented national transformation towards new and retrofit nZEB homes especially in the context of the warming climate and aging population.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4386852006"}}

The construction industry consumes a significant portion of global energy, with space conditioning in buildings accounting for a substantial 34% of energy usage. Notably, the energy consumption of a building is significantly influenced by its envelope. Researchers widely acknowledge that incorporating phase change materials (PCM) into the building envelope is a promising way to enhance energy efficiency and mitigate CO2 emissions in the building sector, owing to their high latent heat capacity. However, PCM must be completely charged after each cycle to exploit its full potential. Natural ventilation is a viable technique to facilitate the charging and discharging cycle of PCM within a 24-h period. To this end, the present study utilized EnergyPlus simulations to optimize the cooling energy savings of a residential building incorporating PCM into its envelope for PCM melting temperatures, considering various ventilation strategies across 45 cities in 15 climate zones worldwide. In order to evaluate the latent heat utilization of PCM and its improvement facilitated by natural ventilation, two novel indicators, namely HS and HR, were formulated to represent the heat stored and released by PCM during a 24-h cycle, respectively. In addition, following an economic analysis of PCM integration, a comprehensive environmental evaluation was carried out, which included the carbon intensities (CI) of all fuel sources contributing to power generation. The study's findings reveal substantial energy savings across all climate zones when controlled natural ventilation is coupled with PCM, and the newly proposed indicators precisely quantify the performance of PCM in all scenarios evaluated. In the arid climate zone (A), combining PCM and natural ventilation enhances energy savings, albeit to a similar extent as using ventilation alone. However, the integration of PCM with temperature-controlled ventilation yields striking energy reductions of up to 72.8%, 85.3%, and 61% in arid (B), warm temperate (C), and snow (D) climate zones, respectively. The cost-benefit analysis reveals a minimal return period of as short as five years in climate zone C. In the same climate zone C, the in-depth environmental analysis reveals a maximal reduction of 42,004 CO2-e kg/year in carbon emissions. In conclusion, this research study demonstrated that integrating PCM with controlled natural ventilation offers a practical, sustainable, and cost-effective solution with eco-friendly and energy-efficient outcomes.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4387993112"}}

Given the importance of occupant satisfaction with thermal comfort in hotel accommodations, previous studies have assessed thermal comfort using either local or global standards. In a hotel catering to diverse guests, a single standard may constrain the formulation of an optimal strategy for improving occupant satisfaction. To address this challenge, this study empirically investigates occupant-centric thermal comfort in hotel guestrooms located in a hot and humid climatic region. To this end, a living-lab-based case study was conducted on a hotel guestroom in Hong Kong, wherein two types of thermal comfort improvement strategies were devised from both local and global perspectives. First, to improve thermal comfort in line with the local standard, it was determined that an ancillary fan coil unit (FCU) energy consumption of 6.0 kW h (approximately 34 % of the existing energy consumption) was required. Second, to improve thermal comfort in line with the global standard, an ancillary FCU energy consumption of 9.4 kW h (approximately 53 % of the existing energy consumption) was necessary. Consequently, in a hot and humid climatic region, the distribution of thermal comfort may vary depending on the type of guest (e.g., domestic or foreign), and ancillary cooling energy expenditure may be incurred to enhance a guest's thermal comfort. The proposed approach is expected to contribute to the creation of occupant-tailored thermal comfort by considering an individual's thermal acclimation to a specific climatic region from both local and global perspectives.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4388559386"}}

However, the comprehensive effect of mood and physical activities on thermal responses is poorly understood. In this study, 20 sex-balanced participants were recruited to investigate differences in thermal perceptions and physiological responses to thermal environments after winter commutes in a climate chamber. Six different conditions with three different indoor seated activities after step-changing from two different outdoor physical activities were studied. Our findings revealed significant disparities in mood scores among participants engaged in activities such as quiet sitting, office work (typing), and entertainment (watching comedy). The thermal sensation and thermal comfort votes were significantly different between sitting quietly/working and entertainment cases after winter commute by running. Notably, both physical and mental activities exhibited the capacity to impact TSV through alterations in heart rate. This was particularly evident in the context of entertainment activities, where a positive mood was found to mitigate the increase in heart rate, as indicated by wrist pulse measurements, under conditions of elevated metabolic activity. Conversely, no significant differences were observed in skin and core temperatures across different indoor mental activities. This suggests that wrist pulse or heart rate could serve as a valuable additional parameter for enhancing the accuracy of real-time thermal comfort predictions in environments with a constant room temperature.

To investigate the human thermal response in commuting, a climate chamber experiment was conducted to simulate outdoor commuting (13 \u00b0C) and indoor rest recovery (24 \u00b0C) in winter. Standing and walking at 4 and 6 km/h were used to simulate temporary rest, walking, and running, respectively. Twenty healthy participants were asked to simulate commuting (13 \u00b0C) with standing/low, 4 km/h/medium, and 6 km/h/high activity levels for 8 min and sitting (24 \u00b0C) for 32 min.

The proposed framework considers various comfort categories based on building use and condition, comfort models based on building operation, sensitivity to climate change, key performance indicators, and their thresholds. The proposed framework is then implemented using a passive house certified high-performance timber dwelling near Brussels as a case study. The thermal comfort in the free-running reference timber dwelling is assessed using a whole-building energy performance simulation model with a static threshold of 26 \u00b0C for the bedrooms and an adaptive threshold for the other occupied zones. The analysis found an increase in indoor overheating degree by 1.7 \u00b0C and ambient warmness degree from 6.4 \u00b0C during heat waves from current scenario to end of the century scenario. However, the reference timber dwelling can effectively suppress climate change impacts with varying degrees of success towards the end of the century. The proposed framework is intended to support decision-makers in effectively evaluating performance during the early stages of building design.

Climate change impacts the entire planet, and its effects are particularly evident in urban areas. Northern cities in Brazil experience a hot and humid climate, which poses a challenge to achieving high levels of thermal performance in housing developments. This challenge is amplified by the fact that most residents do not have access to air conditioning systems, making it difficult to mitigate the heat. Current technologies have the potential to confront this critical situation by diagnosing thermal performance and implementing optimized strategies for modeling multiple climatic scales, including the city, neighborhood, and indoor environment. Therefore, this study aims to fill a research gap by utilizing simulations to predict and optimize the thermal performance of naturally ventilated social housing in hot and humid equatorial climates, while considering the effects of climate change. Adaptive modeling principles were applied, fostering synergy among the meso, local, and microclimatic scales through a unidirectional simulation. The results revealed that the region experiencing the highest real estate growth has witnessed a significant increase in temperature over the years. The comparison between historical and future climate files confirmed predictions of climate change in a pessimistic scenario, particularly regarding temperature and relative humidity indicators. When climate files adjusted for future climate conditions were used, it was discovered that passive building design strategies had a stronger impact on the microclimate compared to heat island mitigation strategies.

Purpose : To assess the core temperature fluctuations during 10-km open-water swimming (OWS) in cool water and the relationship between thermal sensation (TS) after 10-km OWS, core temperature, and local skin thermal sensitivity. Methods : Nine highly trained OWS swimmers (4 female; age 22 [3] y) completed a single 10-km trial in cool water (22.3 \u00b0C) wearing swimsuits for OWS. During the trial, core temperature was continuously recorded via ingestible temperature sensors, and TS after trial was also measured. Then, local skin warm/cool sensitivity was measured in the forearm. Results : All swimmers completed the 10-km OWS. Mean swimming speed for males and females were 1.39 (1.37\u20131.42 m/s) and 1.33 m/s (1.29\u20131.38 m/s), respectively. Core temperature increased in 8 out of 9 swimmers during 10-km OWS ( P = .047), with an average increase of 0.8 \u00b0C. TS after 10-km OWS varied among swimmers. There were no correlations between post-OWS TS and post-OWS core temperature ( P = .9333), whereas there was a negative correlation between post-OWS TS and local skin cool sensitivity ( P = .0056). Conclusion : These results suggest that core temperature in elite swimmers might not decrease during 10-km OWS in the cool water temperature of official OWS. In addition, individual differences in TS after 10-km OWS may be related to skin cool sensitivity rather than core temperature.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4387789533"}}

The global heating and cooling demands have increased to mitigate the effects of the rise in extreme weather events due to climate change. This has led to an increase in global greenhouse gas emissions due to the use of fossil fuels to meet these demands. The current study evaluates how an alternative low-carbon heating and cooling system may provide thermal comfort in residential buildings, specifically in regions that have a humid temperature oceanic climate-for example, the United Kingdom. To meet the net-zero emissions targets set in the United Kingdom by 2050, greenhouse gas emissions generated from heating in residential buildings must fall by 95 %. The leading decarbonisation strategy proposed by their government requires the electrification of the heating system through the installation of heat pumps. Consequently, the average electricity consumption per household is expected to increase. This will impose considerable pressure on electricity networks to source additional (ideally renewable) capacity, which will ultimately be costly. To circumvent this issue, the current study proposes a novel alternative method of providing nearly zero-carbon space and water heating, that can operate almost independently of the electricity grid.

The relationship between OTC-UHIs and urban morphology varies throughout the day, with vegetation cover ratio and sky view factors impacting cooling significantly.

Increasing urban surface albedo is an effective strategy to mitigate UHI. However, the efficacy of high-albedo urban surfaces across varying urban contexts remains poorly understood. In this study, we leverage Urban Weather Generator to systematically simulate the effects of high-albedo roads, walls, and roofs on urban microclimate across Tianjin. Our simulation covers a typical meteorological year, representing typical weather conditions from January to December. Our results reveal that increasing road albedo is more effective in mitigating UHI in fringe areas, whereas increasing wall and roof albedo is more effective in mitigating UHI in central areas. Local climate zones with an urban aspect ratio of about 0.5 can obtain a maximum reduction of road surface temperature (-6\u00b0C) and wall surface temperature (-3\u00b0C). The temperature changes induced by albedo changes show evident seasonal characteristics: the road temperature decreases significantly in summer, while the wall temperature decreases significantly in spring and autumn. Our results could help guide UHI mitigation policies and urban planning in cities hoping to enhance urban surface albedo to balance urban growth and climate resilience.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4388312204"}}

To address the challenge, this study proposes a scalable approach to investigate energy usage patterns and saving potential in hotel guestrooms, in which endogenous parameters (occupancy states and electrical installations) are comprehensively considered. The data was collected over a year from three guestrooms of Hotel \u201cI\u201d in Hong Kong, including energy usage for different electrical installations, indoor temperature and humidity, and check-in or check-out information. The main findings can be summarized as follows. First, energy usage patterns revealed that the average 15-minute interval energy usage during the check-in state was 56.49 Wh, while during the check-out state, it was 44.03 Wh (77.94% compared to the check-in state). Second, the proposed energy-saving strategies can be applied to the case study room, leading to a reduction of 247.53 kWh, which corresponds to 13.79% of the current annual energy usage (1,794.55 kWh) in the case study room. The proposed scalable approach is expected to contribute to enabling occupant-centric appliance control strategies in hotel guestrooms, depending on occupancy states, which leads to cost savings and promises various benefits, such as enhanced guest services and promotional advantages, such as \u201cGreen Hotel\u201d.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4388416071"}}

Extreme heatwaves in tropical cities represent a significant short-term weather challenge, directly impacting urban heat, exacerbating human discomfort, and increasing energy demands. To alleviate this, meteorological adjustments utilizing reflective roofing technologies, such as cool roofs, can effectively mitigate heatwave-induced excess heat and enhance thermal comfort. This study assessed the effectiveness of cool roofs in cooling urban areas following heatwaves in Kolkata, India, using comprehensive city-scale simulations. The study presumed that the existing roofing materials, with a reflectivity of 0.15 and emissivity of 0.85, indicated the unmitigated condition. These materials were replaced with third-generation cool roof materials featuring a reflectivity of 0.80 and emissivity of 0.85, leading to a substantial improvement in urban meteorology and thermal comfort compared to the unmitigated state. Notably, during heatwave episodes, the most significant computed reductions in energy flux were 181.3 Wm\u22122, 16.6 Wm\u22122, 56.3 Wm\u22122, and 251.9 Wm\u22122 for sensible heat, latent heat, ground storage, and net inflow radiation, respectively.

DSF system comprises opaque PV and transparent Glass panels integrated as an exterior skin. Further, the cavity between the DSF\u2019s exterior and interior skins provides airflow that increases PV efficiency and delivers preheated air into the room for space conditioning. The mathematical model is based on energy balance equations written, considering the DSF as an integral part of the room. This system of energy balance equations is then solved analytically under quasi-steady-state conditions for developing a mathematical model in terms of DSF\u2019s design and climatic parameters. The model is employed to investigate multiple design parameters of DSF, including KL ratio (proportion of PV fa\u00e7ade height to total fa\u00e7ade height), Glass fa\u00e7ade transmissivity, PV packing factor, cavity dimensions, and airflow rate.

On average, using TIP can decrease the cooling energy demand by 1.2% and the heating energy demand by 3% across all regions.

Most importantly, future studies are necessary to cover missing climatic regions and urban areas which are not yet been explored. The review also seeks the focus on the standardization of thermal comfort indices and the range of neutral values as per climatic regions. Along with the quantitative studies, a qualitative approach is also required in the research. Furthermore, future studies need to include psychological aspects such as adaptation and acclimatization. This review is the foremost study of the Indian context. It will act as a reference for researchers, architects, planners, and urban designers to improve their knowledge of outdoor thermal comfort and understand the gaps that need to be addressed.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4388948911"}}

To enhance the effectiveness of energy-saving buildings, windows play a crucial role, as they contribute to comfort, energy efficiency, and adaptability. However, traditional static windows, which primarily focus on reducing solar radiation, struggle to strike a balance between heating/cooling requirements during winter and summer seasons. On the other hand, dynamic windows, while offering adjustability, suffer from issues such as high haze and poor color rendering, making them less suitable for residential buildings. In this study, we propose a novel reversible liquid-filled energy-saving window that effectively regulates indoor solar radiation heat gain. To evaluate the dynamic indoor light/heat environment provided by liquid-filled energy-saving windows, we conduct an experimental investigation. Results indicate that windows filled with 10wt% and 20wt% CuSO4 solution cause a 1.5 \u00b0C and 2.5 \u00b0C reduction in indoor mean air temperature compared to water-filled windows during the summer season. Similarly, in the winter season, the decrease is 1.4 \u00b0C and 0.5 \u00b0C, respectively. Moreover, there is no significant difference in indoor illuminance between energy-saving windows filled with 10wt% and 20wt% CuSO4 solution. With the mass concentration of 10%wt CuSO4 solution, indoor mean illuminance difference between the two groups is only 236 lux and 214 lux during the summer and winter seasons, respectively.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4388949064"}}

Microclimate simulations are in high demand to assess the thermal impacts of urban design and vegetation changes. Modeling accurate microclimate dynamics in complex urban settings requires extensive computing power. A hybrid Python approach is introduced to simulate human thermal exposure (mean radiant temperature, MRT) and comfort (Universal Thermal Climate Index, UTCI) in cities. The proposed model combines various engines in Rhinoceros to account for interactions between urban surfaces, tree canopies, and the atmosphere. The model was validated in hot, dry Tempe, USA, using in-situ human-biometeorological observations and then applied to urban archetypes in Bologna and Imola, Italy. MRT and UTCI were simulated at five sites in Bologna, four in Imola, and four in Tempe, with varying building heights and canopy cover for the climatologically hottest week of the year (August 3\u20139). The model performed well with an RMSE of 5.4 \u00b0C, an index of agreement of 0.96, and outperformed existing models for tree-shaded sites. MRT and UTCI were driven mainly by shade from dense urban forms and trees. Highrise, medium-to-high tree canopy cover archetypes were the coolest concerning thermal exposure and comfort. Sites in Tempe exceeded the UTCI categories for Very Strong or Extreme Heat Stress independent of archetype.

Consistent urbanization and global warming escalates the summer temperatures of the urban, significantly impacting daily lives and endangering well-being. It is difficult to balance urban construction and increasing the blue-green space. Hence, understanding the impact of changes in the blue-green spatial patterns in different spaces on the urban thermal environment is beneficial to the rational layout of urban patterns. Drawing from the case study of Shanghai, by employing bivariate spatial autocorrelation and multiscale geographically weighted regression, the spatial interplay between changes in the blue-green spatial distribution and modifications in land surface temperature grades is scrutinized, thus unraveling the underlying mechanisms of their mutual influence. The findings reveal the following: (1) The transformation of the blue-green spatial pattern exhibited substantial discrepancies between the northern and southern sectors. (2) The alteration of the thermal environment in Shanghai varies significantly spatially and is characterized by a decrease in temperature grade in the southwestern suburbs, an increase in the east, and almost no change in the central urban region. (3) Furthermore, the correlation between the extent of the change in the blue-green spatial pattern and the change in land surface temperature manifested spatial unevenness. (4) Finally, the mechanism underlying the changes of alterations in the blue-green spatial pattern on the thermal environment of the city emanates primarily from the influence of heat exchange areas.

Fitness centers have become famous for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. They require different thermal comfort conditions and higher fresh air supply rates than other indoor spaces. However, even well-designed centers may cause discomfort due to factors such as design decisions, ventilation, overheating, and overcrowding. The standards for fitness centers do not consider these specific requirements sufficiently, so this study focuses on understanding the thermal comfort requirements during physical exercise and evaluating spatial and thermal factors affecting the thermal environment around the body. The study investigated the ceiling height, lateral and frontal distances between machines, and vent locations as spatial factors and inlet temperature and air velocity as thermal factors. A thirty-minute moderate-intensity constant work rate exercise test was conducted in a controlled climatic chamber using a cycle ergometer with six healthy male participants. The experiment conditions were simulated in CFD software using the collected data. Once a validated simulation model was provided, computational models for different environmental and spatial scenarios for the five-person cycling class were generated. Using Taguchi L9 (34) orthogonal arrays method, nine spatial scenarios were simulated with three different thermal operations each. Optimal factor levels were determined by using thermal comfort conditions (based on predicted mean vote) around the body\u2019s thermal plume. The results showed that a ceiling height of 5 meters, lateral and frontal distances of 1 meter and 0.5 meters between machines, and Type 2 (two inlets mounted on the ceiling) ventilation strategy were optimal for achieving better thermal comfort values in a thermal condition of 18\u00b0C and 0.2 m\u00b7s-1.

Global urbanization has underscored the significance of urban microclimates for human comfort, health, and building/urban energy efficiency. However, analyzing urban microclimates requires considering a complex array of outdoor parameters within computational domains at the city scale over a longer period than indoors. As a result, numerical methods like Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) become computationally expensive when evaluating the impact of urban microclimates. The rise of deep learning techniques has opened new opportunities for accelerating the modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and system dynamics. Recently, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has been shown to be very promising in accelerating solving the Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and modeling fluid dynamic systems. In this work, we apply the FNO network for real-time three-dimensional (3D) urban microclimate simulation. For modeling large-scale urban microclimate problems, CityFFD simulates urban microclimate features based on the semi-Lagrangian approach and fractional stepping method with the Smagorinsky large eddy simulation model. In our simulation, the 1200 sequential time steps are used as training data. We retain and analyze the data from all stages, including the spin-up period, because we wish to understand how the flow develops transiently from initial conditions, and both one-step and sequential timestep predictions are analyzed. When applied to unseen data with different wind directions, the FNO model has a 0.3% one-step prediction error and a maximum error of 5%.

Tree canopy cover is our natural mitigation tool that absorbs sunlight for photosynthesis, protects humans from incoming radiation, and releases cooling moisture into the air.

This study uses mean evapotranspiration levels to assess the variability of urban heat island effects across the state of Tennessee. Results show that increased developed land surface cover in Tennessee creates measurable changes in atmospheric evapotranspiration. As a result, the mean evapotranspiration levels in areas with less tree vegetation are significantly lower than the surrounding forested areas.

Sometimes, these studies also included the driving rain wind pressure, thereby characterising both critical factors contributing to rainwater penetration into fa\u00e7ade materials. However, practitioners typically rely on performance results obtained from standardised watertightness tests to make fa\u00e7ade design decisions, even though these tests do not recreate the specific exposure combinations that can occur on each fa\u00e7ade.

This study addresses this issue by correcting the existing methodological deficiencies in a prior calculation procedure, which aims to relate the exposure parameters that the fa\u00e7ade configuration withstood during any watertightness test to the expected climate exposures at its design operating conditions. New contributions are presented to enhance the method reliability as well as to reduce calculation effort and reliance on exhaustive weather data.

They include different equations to estimate rs, which show large differences, and significantly overestimate rs under certain conditions. Therefore, their models offer particular opportunities for improvement to reflect the actual vegetation cooling potential. This is necessary to predict the impact of vegetative roofs more accurately on the building energy performance and the urban heat island effect. The rs of both vegetative roof heat and mass transfer models have been developed based on studies with species that are not commonly planted on vegetative roofs. It was found that both models overestimate the rs under certain conditions that could turn into the underestimation of the transpiration rates and the cooling potential. Consequently, this paper aims to develop a novel equation for rs based on field measurements in a semiarid climate. The species tested were Glandularia berterii (C3), Selliera radicans (C3), Phyla reptans (C3), Aptenia cordifolia (CAM), Sedum palmeri (CAM), and Sedum spurium (CAM). A New Linear Model (NLM) was formulated to estimate rs. The regressors of NLM are minimum stomatal resistance (rs,min), incident solar radiation (Rsh), leaf area index (LAI), substrate volumetric water content (VWC), and vapor pressure difference (VPD). The results show that rs,min and Rsh reflect 64% of rs; the species with higher cooling potential were Selliera radicans, Sedum palmeri, and Sedum spurium due to higher LAI and lower/moderate rs,min; and, the NLM showed a better agreement with the measured rs, correcting points where Sailor (2008) and Tabares-Velasco and Srebric (2012) equations significantly overestimated rs.

Using various analytical methods, including context analysis, remote sensing, SPSS correlation and the Sankey analysis, the research examines both weekday and weekend data of Manchester Piccadilly and East Didsbury TODs. Remote sensing analysis reveals Manchester Piccadilly TOD as a UHI hotspot due to concentrated human activities and low Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). East Didsbury TOD, on the other hand, experiences lower UHI intensity because of its lower building and population density. The findings highlight the significant impact of land use and urban morphology on UHI intensity. The paper highlights how TOD-generated commercial and entertainment activities contribute to UHI levels in different locations in Manchester. Factors such as high population density and a higher percentage of workers exacerbate the UHI effect in TODs. The relationship between building heights and UHI challenges the conventional assumption of a positive correlation between floor area ratio (FAR) and UHI. These insights are crucial for TOD planning, emphasising the need to carefully consider land use, population density, and building characteristics in shaping the TOD locations. Implementing measures such as reducing heat emissions from commercial and entertainment activities can lessen the UHI intensity.

The challenges brought up by the growth of informal settlements spans from social-economic to environmental. Previously, upgrading of the informal settlements focused on social-economic aspects such as provision of necessary services for the residents, whereas the quality of the outdoor thermal environment has not received much attention. This paper entails to investigate the potential of upgrading the outdoor thermal environment in informal settlements in the warm humid city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania through examining the influence of addition of trees with different Leaf Area Index (LAI) and incremental increase of buildings heights. The study uses simulation as a method for analysis of the warm season and calculates the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) as a thermal index. Results show substantial improvement of both microclimate and outdoor thermal comfort. Incremental increase of buildings heights in a street canyon to 12, 18, and 24 m leads to the reduction of PET by 2.5, 2.8, and 3.8 \u00b0C respectively at 2:00 p.m. Similarly, applying LAI's of 2, 4, and 6 m2/m2 leads to reduction of the mean radiant temperature by 7.9, 10.1, and 12.2 \u00b0C; while PET was reduced by 3.9, 4.7, and 5.6 \u00b0C respectively at 2:00 p.m. Nonetheless, upgrading of informal settlements shows marginal influence on the reduction of air temperature.

Hence, this study develops an innovative alkali-activated insulation mortar, serving RCP and blast furnace slag as the precursor and expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads as fine aggregate, together with air entrainer. Experimental results show that the mortar had satisfactory workability owing to the RCP substitution, supported by appearance and infrared thermal imaging tests. As the ratio increased, the density, compressive strength, and thermal conductivity of the mortar decreased, due to the increasing volume of porous paste and internal air voids. Subsequently, the material design of the mortar was optimized through the adjusted Box-Behnken design. The obtained mortar achieved a high-volume use (61.7 wt.%) of RCP, and exhibited an extremely low conductivity (\u223c 0.0299 W/(m\u2219K)) among novel lightweight building materials. Energy simulation further indicates that the optimized mortar can surpass traditional insulation materials, including EPS, polyurethane, and rock wool panels, in reducing air conditioning energy consumption across all seasons and climate zones.

This research investigates the potential of volcanic ash as a green roof material, focusing on its thermal conductivity, physical characteristics, and permeability. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine thermal conductivity under different moisture conditions using two measurement devices, TLS 100 and HFM 436/3/1 Lambda. The results revealed that thermal conductivity increases with higher moisture content, indicating improved heat conduction as the material becomes more saturated with water. Particle size distribution analysis demonstrated that the majority of volcanic ash particles fall within the range of sand and gravel, providing a porous and well-draining material. Sand-sized particles create interconnected voids, facilitating efficient water movement, while gravel-sized particles enhance structural stability and load-bearing capacity. The limited presence of silt-sized particles further validated the material's suitability for green roof applications. Permeability tests on loosely compacted volcanic ash revealed higher permeability at 0% compaction, aligning with intended green roof configurations. This high permeability ensures effective drainage, preventing water accumulation and promoting healthy vegetation growth. At 20% compaction, the material still effectively managed water under potential compaction forces, striking a balance between drainage and water retention. Visual examination of green roof samples demonstrated that volcanic ash substrates resisted weed growth due to the absence of fertilization. While the commercial substrate exhibited better vegetation development due to added nutrients, volcanic ash substrates supported vegetation survival throughout the summer period with an irrigation system, reducing maintenance and lifecycle costs.

Sufficient daylight in the indoor environment of buildings is important not only for vision and well-being as daylight also has significant non-visual effects on the human organism. The provision of daylight in the interiors of buildings significantly affects the architectural and urban parameters of the building environment. Harmonized EN 17037 introduced a number of changes and ambiguities to the relatively established principles of incorporating daylight in buildings in several European countries; these were significant for both architects and other stakeholders. This paper compares the long-standing practice and historical context of daylight provision according to the criteria of national standards in selected European countries (Germany, Czech Republic, Slovak republic, Sweden) with the minimum target daylight factor according to the harmonized EN 17037. The consequences of the methodological differences and design criteria of daylight provision are presented in case studies of the assessment of the daylight in residential rooms and typical school classrooms. Daylight factor and lighting distribution are analyzed for different room scenarios, different window configurations and obstruction angles according to local standards in the mentioned European countries versus EN 17037.

The accurate prediction of thermal sensation among office workers, at design and post-occupancy stages, is crucial for controlling indoor temperature efficiently and correcting deficiencies in workspaces, ensuring healthy and productive working conditions. Traditional analytical comfort models are still the best tool for this purpose given their potential for interpretation. However, their reliability is undermined by their poor accuracy. Based on 304 data series of point-in-time measurements of quantitative and qualitative comfort-related parameters collected in an experimental campaign in three office buildings, one air-conditioned and two in free evolution, in San Luis Potos\u00ed (Mexico), this work aims to identify the major error-causing factors of steady and adaptive comfort models. The divergences between predicted and reported thermal sensation were set as a dependant variable of two multiple regressions, one for each model. Eighteen independent demographic, environmental, contextual and subjective variables were considered. No multicollinearity problems were identified. Our findings show that contextual factors and humidity perception were relevant in the adaptive model error. Clothing insulation highly impacted the accuracy of both models while age and body mass were not statistically significant for either of them. Metabolic rate was the factor with the greatest influence in the error of the steady model.

As the natural lighting is becoming common in buildings, e.g. the large curtain walls in high-rise buildings, the direct solar radiation could also affect the indoor occupants. Consequently, effects of the clothing color on the human body could not be ignored. Unfortunately, very limited studies have been reported in this field. In order to acquire the contribution of the clothing color to the heat transfer and thermal sensation of the indoor occupants, experimental study was conducted in this paper. Firstly, considering the non-uniformity of direct solar radiation on the indoor occupants, the equations that were used to calculate the solar heat gain of different body segments and the clothing surface temperature were revised, respectively. Thereafter, an experimental study was conducted in a climate chamber in winter. Participants wore cloth with different colors when exposed to different solar radiation intensities, during which the mean skin temperature, heat transfer, and subjective evaluations were acquired. Results showed that the dark clothing led to the reduced total heat loss by 4.52%, compared with that of the light clothing, at the solar radiation intensity of 200 W/m2. And the mean thermal sensation vote (TSV) under dark clothing was 0.65 higher than that under the light clothing. Meanwhile, at the solar radiation of 400 W/m2, the total heat loss under dark clothing was 14.17% lower than that under the light clothing, and the mean TSV under the dark clothing was found to be 0.25 higher that under light clothing condition.

In the present paper, different roof structures containing PCM have been examined to analyze their thermal behavior. The governing equations were developed and solved for a sample unit extracted from a typical roof. The control volume based finite element method has been applied for solving coupled equations governing heat transfer through the roof and flow of melted PCM. The effect of key parameters including thermal diffusivity of the PCM and the wall, Prandtl number (Pr), Rayleigh number (Ra) and solid wall thickness to total thickness has been examined. The main results indicate an enhancement of heat transfer through the increase of the thermal diffusivity of the PCM with respect to the building material. Increasing the thermal diffusivity ratio from 1 to 25 doubles the heat transfer rate and decreases the full melting time by 80% for high Rayleigh. Pr affects the mode of heat transfer but has little impact on PCM melting rate. Raising Ra improves heat transfer under the condition of high thermal diffusivity in the PCM. Increasing Rayleigh number from 104 to 106 doubles the heat transfer rate and reduces the melting by 67% for high thermal diffusivity ratio. Finally, increasing the size of the wall thickness does not affect the fraction of melted PCM but reduces the heat transfer rate.

The research followed the experimental method by studying and testing(conventional, advanced, and photovoltaic glazing)by Revit and Onyx Solar analysis in the Architectural Department classes to find the appropriate type of glazing in the spaces of hot, dry areas. The results showed that advanced glazing is the best by reducing the cooling loads andincreasingthermal performance quality. Photovoltaic glazing showed its efficiency in filling part of the electrical energy needs within the spaces of the Architectural department.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4390495877"}}

The global construction sector is increasingly embracing constructions employing wood, widely recognized as a low-carbon bio-material, to mitigate carbon emissions, particularly in public buildings. Prior to the adoption stage, a strategic analysis of how occupants perceive indoor wooden spaces is crucial for effective environmental planning. Thus study delved into the visual and perceptual warmth effects of wood through a comparative analysis (combining virtual reality and physiological response measurements) of thermal sensations in spaces featuring various finishing materials. In a slightly cool environment based on predicted mean vote, subjects ranked the perceived warmth in the following order: wood> brick>wallpaper>concrete, with wood surpassing concrete by 3.30, in terms of visual warmth. These results support the hue-heat hypothesis that materials in the yellow-red spectrum, particularly bricks and wood, are commonly perceived as warm. Moreover, the representative psychological impression associated with wood, such as warmth and coziness, considerably influences these perceptions. Based on a multisensory thermal perception mechanism, considering vision as a key element, the wooden space was evaluated as the warmest space for the body. Importantly, the positive impact of the visual and perceptual thermal effects of wood, alongside the impression of space (as being comfortable, positive, and relaxed), notably enhanced thermal comfort, especially in cooler conditions. Consequently, an environment initially deemed uncomfortable by 77% of the participants was subsequently evaluated as slightly comfortable. Furthermore, the subjective evaluation of the thermal environment was validated through correlation analysis involving thermal perception biomarkers (like electrodermal activity) and thermal comfort model variables.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4390532548"}}
