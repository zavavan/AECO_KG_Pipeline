A variety of sensors are being used to monitor different patient conditions. Bed occupancy monitoring provides clinicians a quantitative measure of bed entry/exit patterns and may provide information relating to sleep quality. This paper presents a bed occupancy monitoring system using a bed pressure mat sensor. A clinical trial was performed involving 8 patients to collect bed occupancy data. The trial period for each patient ranged from 5-10 weeks. This data was analyzed using a participatory design methodology incorporating clinician feedback to obtain bed occupancy parameters. The parameters extracted include the number of bed exits per night, the bed exit weekly average (including minimum and maximum), the time of day of a particular exit, and the amount of uninterrupted bed occupancy per night. The design of a clinical user interface plays a significant role in the acceptance of such patient monitoring systems by clinicians. The clinician user interface proposed in this paper was designed to be intuitive, easy to navigate and not cause information overload. An iterative design methodology was used for the interface design. The interface design is extendible to incorporate data from multiple sensors.

Intelligent porch research is an important issue in smart home development; however, such a field was rarely investigated in the literature. This investigation proposes a new hybrid and dynamic fusion of multiple experts for the intelligent porch system. First, a new hybrid priority tree with decision fusion (HPTD-fusion) is proposed to eliminate the problems of tag-based authentication outdoors. The HPTD-fusion first verifies the vocal entrance code (VEC), and subsequently the remaining experts are performed in the cases of AND, OR or majority voting for decision fusion. Second, the post-mapping dynamic weighted fusion (PMDW-fusion) scheme is presented to adapt the indoor porch audio-visual environment. The PMDW-fusion dynamically assigns the higher weight to experts with higher performance, and then sums all participating experts for score fusion. The experimental results demonstrate that FRR and FAR can reach up to 0.18 and 0.19, respectively, when the system is tested in the outdoor environment. Furthermore, the indoor recognition accuracy can be increased to 86.1% using the proposed fusion scheme. The experiments have verified the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed system.

In doing so we firstly consider visualisation environments such as geographical information systems (GIS) and Cartography tools, digital globes, virtual simulation environments, building information models and gaming platforms. Secondly, we consider a number of visualisation techniques with a focusing on GIS and Cartography tools including space time cubes, heat maps, choropleth maps, flow maps and brushing.

Building energy management and the necessity to reduce overall energy consumption is becoming an increasingly important topic. Especially in dynamic environments, where the setting and occupancy keep changing, knowing occupancy information, including the number and identities of the occupants and where they are located, can be beneficial in energy management as well as other application areas including safety, security and emergency response. In particular, occupancy information has a direct impact on various aspects of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, such as heat loads, system running time, required heating, cooling and distribution of conditioned air, and preferred temperature set points. Energy-saving strategies can be carried out in response to real-time occupancy changes. In this paper, an RFID based occupancy detection system is proposed to support demand-driven HVAC operations by detecting and tracking multiple stationary and mobile occupants in multiple spaces simultaneously. The proposed system estimates the thermal zone where each occupant is located, and reports the number of occupants for each thermal zone in real time. The field tests yielded an average zone level detection accuracy of 88% for stationary occupants and 62% for mobile occupants. For scattering analysis, averages distances to corresponding centroids were 1.45 m and 3.24 m for stationary and mobile occupants, respectively. In order to explore the benefits of demand-driven HVAC operations, current HVAC work procedures are examined, major energy consumers in HVAC systems are identified and quantified, and energy-saving strategies are presented.

The ICT-oriented urban planning experience of Taipei City is used to test the limitations and application of the framework. The study finds that technological trends, physical infrastructure, ICT content, interface design, and user characteristics are key factors that subtly interrelate with each other and should be considered integral when initiating such strategies.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2141393206"}}

With a sample of cities from the European Union we assess the city-specific impacts on urban performance of a complex \u201curban smartness\u201d indicator by applying a Spatial Autoregressive Local Estimate to an urban production function. The results of this econometric analysis point in the direction of the importance of space-specific characteristics in shaping the economic effect of smart urban qualities, providing grounding to place-based public policies that account for local characteristics. We also identify different clusters with respect to the impacts of smartness on urban performance and wealth, highlighting the need for geographically differentiated policy actions.

In the U.S., 40% of the energy consumption is from buildings, approximately 48% of which is consumed by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Implementing demand driven HVAC operations is a way to reduce HVAC related energy consumption, and ultimately to achieve sustainable building operations and maintenance. This relies on the availability of occupancy information, which determines peak/off-hour modes and impacts cooling/heating loads of HVAC systems. This research proposes an occupancy monitoring system that is built on a combination of non-intrusive sensors that can detect indoor temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, door status, light, sound and motion. The effectiveness of each sensor in occupancy estimation is evaluated. The sensor data is communicated wirelessly, and processed in real time using a back-propagation (BP) artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. Field tests are carried out in a lab space that is shared by up to 9 people for 15 consecutive days. The test results report an overall detection rate of over 90%, which indicates the ability of the proposed system to monitor the occupancy information of multi-occupancy spaces in real time in support of demand driven HVAC operations.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2149973764"}}

Secondly, the communication platform must support two-way asynchronous communication for collecting public opinions and proposals. Finally, the user interface, operations and management of the platform must engage citizens to participate in the urban planning process.

The drive to design more energy efficient buildings is increasingly leading to complex buildings with finely balanced ventilation and heating/cooling strategies. Commissioning of the often complex control systems is difficult and time consuming, as it relies on the sensing technology of the Building Management System, which is designed to control the building during normal operation, but lacks the resolution for thorough analysis of internal conditions to resolve initial building operation problems. This can result in a drawn out commissioning process, which is costly for the construction team. Moreover, insufficient commissioning and maintenance of building controls can lead to poorly functioning buildings, with great cost-implications for landlords, occupants and employers. This paper introduces a sensor overlay method that can support building control commissioning and maintenance by providing high-resolution data and speeding up the commissioning process. The development of the method and its practical application during a long-term study period, which coincided with the commissioning of an advanced naturally ventilated building, are described.

Every occupant in the building who has a smart phone is able to monitor their usage and adjust their own energy policy in real-time.

It is assumed that a forward error correcting channel code is used to reduce the error rate, but no repeat mechanism (ARQ) is used to correct the remaining errors. In such systems, uncorrected errors usually cause rejection of messages with an incorrect MAC. This paper introduces a technique for joint verification and decoding of the received message, based on targeting the maximum likelihood (message, MAC) pair. This allows the acceptance of corrected messages and their MACs, even if a few bits of the MAC are incorrect. This is comparable to the situation where handwritten signatures are accepted provided they are not too different from a reference. The algorithm also outputs a reliability measure on the verified message in the form of a log-likelihood ratio (LLR).

But finding shared factors over multiple matrices is more novel problem. Specifically, given two matrices, we want to find a set of factors shared by these two matrices and sets of factors specific for the matrices. Not only does such decomposition reveal what is common between the two matrices, it also eliminates the need of explaining that common part twice, thus concentrating the non-shared factors to uniquely specific parts of the data. This paper studies a problem called Joint Subspace Boolean Matrix Factorization asking exactly that: a set of shared factors and sets of specific factors. Furthermore, the matrix factorization is based on the Boolean arithmetic. This restricts the presented approach suitable to only binary matrices. The benefits, however, include much sparser factor matrices and greater interpretability of the results. The paper presents three algorithms for finding the Joint Subspace Boolean Matrix Factorization, an MDL-based method for selecting the subspaces' dimensionality, and throughout experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms.

This is not only transforming how we study, design, and manage cities but opens up new possibilities for tools that give people access to up-to-date information about urban dynamics, allowing them to take decisions that are more in sync with their environment. This paper documents the ongoing LIVE Singapore! project which explores the development of an open platform for the collection, elaboration and distribution of a large and growing number of different kinds of real-time data that originate in a city. Inspired by recent data.gov initiatives, the platform is structured to become itself a tool for developer communities, allowing them to analyze data and write applications that create links between a city's different real-time data streams, offering new insights and services to citizens. Being a compact island based city-state metropolis, Singapore offers a unique context for this study. This paper addresses the value of stream data for city planning and management as well as modalities to give citizens meaningful access to large amounts of data capable of informing their decisions. We describe the technology context within which this project is framed, illustrate the requirements and the architecture of the open real-time data platform to serve as a base for programming the city, and finally we present and discuss the first platform prototype (using real-world data from operators of cellphone networks, taxi fleet, public transport, sea port, airport, and others).

Abstract Communicating urban density: Assessing the challenges and opportunities in the use of 3-D representation for public participation in planning  Syeda Laila Nargis  The issue of urban densities is central for cities that aim at reducing their environmental footprints. As many cities are devising intensification policies that would significantly alter the spatial form, the demand for public participation in the planning process becomes more pressing. To meet this demand, specialists employ three dimensional (3-D) technologies that allow effective communication with non-specialists. Urban density is a complicated notion which is difficult to communicate to non-specialists.   The purpose of the present study is to identify some of the difficulties faced by specialists and non-specialists that wish to exchange a dialogue over urban density. It focuses on perception and cognition problems regarding density in 3-D digital representation. It endeavors more specifically to understand whether an active engagement with digital 3-D models displaying density changes favors a better cognition of specialists and non-specialists including those who come to the experiments with preconceived (false) conceptions.  The results show that there is a significant difference between active and passive engagement with 3-D models. The success rate of participants\u2019 actively interacting with the digital model is higher than that of their passive counterparts. By stressing the fact that an active engagement with 3-D digital modes favours a better cognition of urban density this study can contribute to the improvement of the methods and tools used to encourage the public participation to the planning debates pertaining to density.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2139918800"}}

In the last decade, the focus of building research has slowly shifted from sustainable building to Intelligent Building (IB) and both concepts are expected to merge in order to cater to the growing requirement for a better, productive and efficient environment comprising of functionality; safety-security; thermal, acoustical, indoor air- quality, visual comfort and building integrity etc - without consuming excessive energy. Many of these requirements are indicators of user satisfaction falling under the realm of IB and were beyond the scope of the preceding era of sustainable building research. With time, definition of IB has changed from purely technical to more humane - driven by fast-paced information and communication technology or ICT. Today's IB is primarily user-oriented and its success factor relies on its active interaction with occupants or user-connectivity. Hence, IB demands systematic evaluation of its performance by its users. Unfortunately, such feedback is not very structured in case of IB which differs significantly from its traditional counterpart. As a result, Post Occupancy Evaluation (POE) - a highly acknowledged evaluation tool used by occupants of conventional building has been implemented in many IBs with certain level of compromise. To bridge this knowledge gap, this research proposes the conceptual POE framework exclusively designed for IB. After considering intelligent attributes and their influence on user- connectivity, the framework is planned which is suitable for indicative level POE study for lighting system (representative of a traditional system) and access control system (representative of a smart system). It was noted that in the first case, traditional POE is insufficient and needs to incorporate the intelligent features. In the second case, there is a conflict of interests of user-connectivity and system performance. As more buildings are adopting IB environment and more designers are considering seriously the notion of feedback, the proposed model can be beneficial for a knowledge-based paradigm shift of the building industry.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2062880238"}}

We aim to narrow this gap by enhancing people's experience of physical spaces with digital, civic technologies that are directly accessible within that space. This paper presents the findings of a design trial allowing users to interact with a public screen via their mobile phones. The screen facilitated a feedback platform about a concrete urban planning project by promoting specific questions and encouraging direct, in-situ, real-time responses via SMS and twitter. This new mechanism offers additional benefits for civic participation as it gives voice to residents who otherwise would not be heard. It also promotes a positive attitude towards local governments and gathers information different from more traditional public engagement tools.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2168848241"}}

On-street parking is an important component of the parking system. Because of its occupancy of roadway resources, it can significantly impact traffic performance and safety. The aim of this paper is to give a quantitative analysis of the influence of on-street parking on travel time. The travel time data of the motor vehicles moving in the road sections with on-street parking are gathered by observers. A proportional hazard-based duration model is proposed to analyze the influential factors related to on-street parking, including effective lane width, the number of parking maneuvers, and occupancy. The results show that on-street parking has a significant impact on the travel time of vehicles. In addition, various factors can modify travel time in different degrees, and the model can be used to estimate the travel time under assumed conditions. It is hoped that this paper will help to improve the planning and management of on-street parking.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2120968960"}}

First, smart cities are defined next to similar but different concepts such as digital cities, intelligent cities or ubiquitous cities. It is argued that the smart city-concept is in fact a more user-centered evolution of the other city-concepts which seem to be more technological deterministic in nature. The principles of crowdsourcing are explained and the different manifestations are demonstrated. By means of a case study, the generation of ideas for innovative uses of ICT for city innovation by citizens through an online platform is studied, as well as the selection process. For this selection, a crowdsourcing solution is compared to a selection made by external experts. The comparison of both indicates that using the crowd as gatekeeper and selector of innovative ideas yields a long list with high user benefits. However, the generation of ideas in itself appeared not to deliver extremely innovative ideas.

This chapter describes the theoretical foundations of a research project, called City Induction, aimed at the creation of a model for the development of such an instrument, departing from existing theories, which are integrated through a discursive grammar. The proposed model is composed of three sub-models: (1) a model for formulating urban programs from the analysis and interpretation of the context, based on Alexander\u2019s pattern language; (2) a model for generating urban plans that match the program, based on Stiny\u2019s shape and description grammars; and (3) a model for evaluating urban plans, that can be used for analyzing, comparing and ranking alternative solutions, departing from Hillier\u2019s space syntax. A common urban space ontology guarantees the syntactic and semantic interoperability among the three sub-models.

Some of the most powerful tools for promoting change are those related to conceptualization and visualization. When considering urban plans that aren't just incremental improvements over what already exists, city officials, urban planners and the general public must be able to visualize not just the merits of those plans in isolation, but how they interact with all the infrastructure that already exists.

Using dually-polarized technology to double the spectral efficiency is very attractive in satellite communication systems. However, the cross polarization interference (XPI) which is inevitable will degrade the performance of the system. In order to eliminate it, a cross polarization interference cancellation (XPIC) is necessary, at least under unfavourable propagation conditions. This paper mainly studies the issue of cross polarization interference cancellation for dually-polarized radio systems over earth-space links. A joint XPIC and DEAF is presented, and compared with conventional XPIC, DEAF and other equalizer structures. The study shows that even under the circumstances with XPI only, the combination of XPIC and DEAF are necessary, for the XPI in the signal will cause ISI during the signal processing which can not be eliminated by the XPIC.

Rank order filters feature heavily in these approaches, and recently, a novel design tool, known as a PO plot, has been introduced. This tool can be used to determine the optimum rank parameter when using these extensions of the HMT to locate features in noisy data. In this paper, the properties of the PO plot are exploited in such a way that an extension of the HMT, known as a POHMT, can be used as a discriminatory filter which selectively marks or discards features in an image. This paper summarises the POHMT, and the PO plot, before demonstrating how these can be used to implement a discriminatory filter.

However, skills and knowledge of the participants differ sub stantially and computer support for complex planning still is at its beginning. Especia lly computer-aided collaborative planning for 3D city and building models is a new challenge with many open research questions. Mainly two communities can interdisciplinary contri bute to a solution: Geoinformatics and Computational Civil Engineering. Both fields have a tradition in 2D planning and both are developing towards a \u201d3D science\u201d. For example, 3D models in different scales should be included into the planning process right from the b eginning to complement 2D plans. Furthermore, 3D geo-databases should provide on-demand internet-based access to tracks and other infrastructure models. Therefore 3D geo w eb services should simplify the access to objects above and under the earth surface. Data man agement tools should interact with efficient 3D computer vision techniques.

In the global context, the population of cities and urbanized areas has developed from a minority to become the majority. Now cities are the largest, most complex and most dynamic man-made systems. They are vibrant centres of cultural life and engines that drive local and global economies. Yet, contemporary urbanized areas are environmentally, socially and economically unsustainable entities laying increasing pressure on the surrounding rural areas. Traditional methods of planning and managing large cities that lead to this situation have reached their limits. The planning and design processes therefore need a radical re-thinking. On the computational side, this necessitates the integration of new methods and instruments. On the planning and design side, this requires the involvement of stakeholders and decision makers much earlier than normally done in the past. The combination of interactive design and computation will demonstrate the effects and side effects of urban-rural planning or re-development. We build our design research approach on dynamics and scale: viewing cities and settlements as entities with dynamic urban metabolisms, we propose to apply stocks and flows simulations to the building scale (small, S-Scale), to the urban scale (medium, M-Scale), and to the territorial scale (large, L-Scale).

The vast majority of historical buildings are very energy inefficient; as energy costs continue to rise, they need smarter energy management strategies, since traditional ways of improving energy efficiency through structural retrofits are very expensive and not always possible in historical buildings. The paper shows the development of a new smart strategy to improve the energy efficiency of historical buildings without significant construction work. The strategy is based on Information Technologies and Wireless Sensor Networks, Building Information Modelling and interoperable energy simulation tools and also requires and stimulates an improvement of human awareness and competence. The paper reports the results of the first phase of the Smart Energy Efficient Middleware for Public Spaces project that addresses reduction in energy usage and the CO2 footprint of existing public buildings and spaces, by an intelligent ICT-based service which monitors and manages the energy consumption. Preliminary results have led to the development of a middleware tool which enables the interoperability of software and Wireless Sensor Networks to monitor energy consumption, controlling environmental parameters such as luminance and temperature to take advantage of natural resources (i.e. daylight and solar energy) in order to ensure the best possible comfort conditions with the most efficient use of energy.

Parking requirements should have a logical relationship with observed levels of parking use and with goals related to transportation, land use, and housing. These requirements are important elements of transportation policy because they influence vehicle ownership rates, travel choices, and mobility options. These local ordinances also shape land use outcomes, such as density, and social outcomes, such as housing affordability. This paper reports on a study of parking requirements for income-restricted, affordable multifamily housing. This form of land use is of particular interest because of its cost sensitivity and controversial nature. The study reported here used household surveys and overnight occupancy counts to assess the use of parking across varied types of income-restricted, affordable housing in the city of San Diego, California. Overall, the use of parking was found to be slightly less than one-half the rate for all rental units in San Diego but varied across affordable housing types (e.g., for families versus for seniors), location (e.g., access to mass transit, opportunity to walk), and bedroom count.

Smart buildings as a concept is now becoming prominent in the vocabulary of Architects, Engineers, Construction contractors, Technology companies, Property developers and the Estate or facility management function within organisations. Public or private sector, smart building goals are now prevalent in corporate strategies whenever new build or retrofit / refurbishment is planned. But there seems no common consensus on what this really means. The 1990\u2019s and 2000\u2019s witnessed much hype around intelligent buildings concepts. However in many instances the hype never produced tangible results. Now the scene has changed. Sustainability and carbon management is increasingly on the agenda of boardroom decision making and \u201csmart\u201d in smart buildings seems to have a purpose, almost as a mission statement. The lack of clear definitions on what encompasses a smart building and what is to be expected when utilising a smart building whether as a solitary or group experience is causing the supply side industry to throttle back the adoption rate. Value structures justifying adoption are not clear in this early adaptor stage. Thus costs associated with the realisation of a smart building are quite hard to justify. This is compounded by the rapid pace of technology advancement and the continual refresh of new products and solutions that purport to provide an improved functionality or better price to performance advantage. Thus strategies for smart building realisation need to be formalised into industry accepted frameworks which can be applied in many market sectors \u2013 or verticals, and which can be applied in the context of small, medium and large buildings or campus premises.

In this paper the authors address a challenging problem of predicting on-street parking occupancy based on sensors with occasionally missing data. These missing values are most likely not missing at random. However, the exact process behind it is unknown at the outset. For example, an entry in the data stream might read: \u201cat time t, blockface b, which has capacity 20, has 18 working sensors, and of those working sensors 10 indicate that a parking space is occupied.\u201d The challenge is to infer as accurately as possible the actual occupancy of blockface b, i.e. the occupancy of all parking spaces, including the ones with inoperative sensors. The fact that sensors are inoperative only occasionally allows us to learn a demand model and a sensor noise model jointly, and use this to \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d in the best possible way. The authors introduce a series of sensor noise models of increasing complexity that are suited for several sensor characteristics. Cross-validation allows the selection of the suitable model for a particular application. The sensor noise models introduced are flexible and can be combined with any probabilistic model for demand and hence have a very wide applicability. In our demonstration application the authors find that sensors are more likely to be inoperative when parking spaces are empty, in particular during busy traffic periods. This supports the hypothesis that drive-by-traffic is an important source of noise for the sensor. Compared to baseline methods based on a missing-at-random assumption our method gives better predictive performance and avoids a systematic bias in the inferred occupancies.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W618445315"}}

The chance of getting a short-term parking space cannot be estimated reliably because of high situational variation. As a result, parking search traffic amounts to 20% of total traffic in the inner districts of Vienna. Previous attempts to solve the problem through better information of drivers rely on accurate systems that navigate drives to the next parking space. They have failed due to high cost for roadside sensors and are also controversial, because they indirectly promote car use. More interesting is a service, which informs road users early about the situation at the destination. It supports the use of alternative modes and reduces parking search traffic at times, when the parking pressure exceeds the normal level due to unforeseeable circumstances. The real-time utilization model being developed in CoMPASS provides no exact information on single parking spaces, but an accurate picture and reliable prediction of the parking pressure at the destination. It uses 3 existing real-time data sources: (i) location data of mobile-phone parking; (ii) occupancy of car parks in the vicinity; and (iii) volumes of in- and outflowing traffic.

Guidelines for Systems with Complex Requirements", "abstract": "Building Automation Systems Design. Guidelines for Systems with Complex Requirements. Buildings today are becoming more and more advanced and the demands on building services are increasing. A modern building is expected to provide a number of services with high security, energy efficiency and convenience. For a building with complex requirements due to the activity, such as a hospital, the services provided are even more advanced and the requirements on them are higher. This implies for the need of a building automation system. These systems come with a cost and have some drawbacks. This thesis will take on the task to study how to benefit from the possibilities with building automation systems while minimizing the drawbacks. The aim is to find guidelines for how to design, procure and manage a building automation system in a hospital in an effective way. The thesis contains a theoretical part, describing the general architecture and functions of a building automation system. Further treated is the different technologies that supply this function and handles communication. Interviews and participation in meetings with people working with building automation systems in hospitals and other buildings with complex requirements due to the activity has been carried out. This has resulted in a part that contains their collection of knowledge, experiences and opinions on these systems. Many of the main issues with building automation systems are treated, like how to avoid dependency on a small group of people and how to ensure the function of several systems that integrate with each other. The last part of this thesis contains guidelines useful when designing, procuring and managing building automation systems with complex requirements. They are based on conclusions from the previous part and the authors own opinions. Some of the guidelines treat what type of technology that is suitable for different systems, how to coordinate a system and how to ensure future function, compatibility and access to service.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W114752587"}}

As a case study in the development of such expertise, in this thesis I explore the work of the Urban Systems Laboratory (USL), established in 1968 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with funding from the Ford Foundation. Using computationally intensive methods, behavioral models and the latest techniques of the information sciences, research at the USL emphasized the role of rational, analytical, social scientific expertise in managing social conflict. In particular, I explore the work of Jay W. Forrester, a member of the USL whose research on the city was published in 1969 as Urban Dynamics. Using an IBM Systems/360 Model 67, Forrester built one of the first large-scale, interactive, computational models of a city specifically to explore the consequences of the social policies of the period and more generally the possibility of the social engineering of complex social systems in a postindustrial society.

This research investigates the possibility of using a sensor mounted on a vehicle to collect parking utilization data in parallel parking areas along arterial streets. There are many promising sensor technologies; Laser Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is used in this pilot study. In this prototype system, the LIDAR scans 180 degrees in a vertical plane, orthogonal to the vehicle's direction of travel. In each scan the LIDAR sensor returns the distance to the nearest target at each angle. This paper discusses how these returns are then processed to estimate the location of the curb and the presence of objects in the road (i.e., on the near side of the curb). Occlusion reasoning and location reasoning are then applied to determine which of the objects are vehicles, which of those vehicles are parked, and where. The occupancy of the parking area, vehicle size, and vehicle-to-vehicle spacing are then measured. This automated vehicle presence detection promises to greatly reduce the labor of parking surveys, provide measures that were formerly cost prohibitive, and potentially do so in real time. The host vehicle could be a transit bus or another municipal vehicle performing ordinary duties, further reducing the data collection costs. The method was applied to an area with unmarked, on-street parking near the Ohio State University campus in Columbus, Ohio. Vehicle counts from five trips were compared against concurrent ground truth from video with favorable results. Results are then presented for 33 measurement trips made over four years.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W167891503"}}

Local governments struggle to engage time poor and seemingly apathetic citizens, as well as the city's young digital natives, the digital locals. Capturing the attention of this digitally literate community who are technology and socially savvy adds a new quality to the challenge of community engagement for urban planning. This project developed and tested a lightweight design intervention towards removing the hierarchy between those who plan the city and those who use it. The aim is to narrow this gap by enhancing people's experience of physical spaces with digital, civic technologies that are directly accessible within that space. The study's research informed the development of a public screen system called Discussions In Space (DIS). It facilitates a feedback platform about specific topics, e.g., a concrete urban planning project, and encourages direct, in-situ, real-time user responses via SMS and Twitter.

It was also deployed in conjunction with a major urban planning project in Brisbane to explore the system's opportunities and challenges of better engaging with Australia's new digital locals. Finally, the merits of the short-texted and ephemeral data generated by the system were evaluated in three focus groups with professional urban planners.

Abstract This essay proposes a combination of commonsense knowledge and the spreading activation theory to strengthen the breadth of spreading activation of user's behavioral information in the field of intelligent environment design. The ontology cited in traditional artificial intelligence is roughly used to express and share knowledge. It is described with concepts, the properties of concepts, and the relationships among concepts, and is mostly presented with the tree-structured classification. However, there are often only vertical subordinate relationships between concepts with no horizontal and cross-layer interactions. Hence, we employ the constrained spreading activation model to perform a series of algorithms, further constructing the knowledge rules which can be commonly utilized to reinforce the breadth of activation process of user's behavioral information in an intelligent environment. These rules can provide a reference to the network service of digitalized cities in the future, and can also support the simulation assessment of applicability of intelligent environment design by employing embedded interactive technology.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2063229897"}}

Residential parking facilities status After investigating several new residential area of Shenyang, the sale of garage in the district is very good. And some garages are sold even more quickly than the residences. So the price of garage is increasing as well. As building sales staff told, some garages sold out in few weeks after Building opening, and many clients have started to inquire the relative information before the opening quotation of the building. All of the garages have electrically operated gate and radiator, and everyone has Certificate of property title. Many owners park any place the like because of the short supply of garages.

In view of the above situation, we need to improve the situation of lack space to parking due to the appropriate. So how do we save space for so many cars in the city where the price of land is high. At present, there are two consensus views: stereoscopic parking building, or stereoscopic parking lot under the ground. The underground parking can be seen everywhere. It is very expensive to improve underground parking lot, however this has solved some problems. And there are many restriction factors to build underground parking garage. Therefore, to build a stereoscopic parking building which cover small area and contain much is an effective way to settle the problems.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2082004996"}}

INTRODUCTION Over the last decades the demand for physical activities has been growing, which puts a high pressure on the sports arenas. From 1964 to 2007 the number of athletes has quadrupled with a steady increase (Pilgaard, 2009). Surveys also show that people are dropping the classic club sports in favour of more flexible sports (Brixen et al., 2010). This calls for a better and more optimal use of the existing sports arenas to keep up with this growing trend. In order to improve the utilisation of a sports arena, its existing use must be examined. This includes examining the number of users using the arena at the same time and the occupancy of the court. Administrators are especially interested in whether the arena is empty, used by a few people or full and the time for when the occupancy changes. The position of the users is also important as they might only use half a court, which means the other half could be rented out to another group. Manual registration of this is cumbersome and expensive and an automatic approach is therefore needed. For such a system to work in general it should be independent of the size of the court, lighting conditions and without any interaction with the users. This can be obtained with a camera. Detecting people with a camera raises some privacy issues though. Not all people like surveillance and the fear of being observed could keep some people out of the arenas. This work therefore proposes an automatic method to analyse the occupancy of a sports arena using thermal imaging. One of the advantages of thermal cameras is that the persons recorded cannot be identified, which is an important factor if the system is to be accepted by the users of the sports arena. On top of that, thermal cameras are invariant to lighting, changing backgrounds and colours, which make them more desirable for an automated application. METHOD The activity at the court is measured by a thermal camera mounted on one of the walls around the arena. The camera detects the long waved infrared radiation emitted by all hot objects which generates a greyscale image that represents the temperature in the scene. Hot object will be bright and cold objects will be dark. This makes it relatively easy to make software algorithms that automatically separate people from the colder background. For each image the persons are counted and their positions on the court are found using a prior calibration. By summing over several images this gives the number of persons and their position for every 5 minute period, which can be used to analyse the use of the arena. The detailed technical description of the system can be found in (Gade et al., 2012). RESULTS Preliminary tests of the system have been conducted in ten different sports arena, one week each. Capturing video with 10 frames per second generates 60,480,000 frames during the ten weeks. As this amount of data will be nearly impossible to manually annotate, the precision of the system have been compared to ground truth for two days covering different types of sport. The result is an average error of 11.76 % in the number of people during time with activity. During the full test period the system shows that it very precisely categorises activity level in zero, low and high activity. Comparing the observations during an arbitrary week to the booking schedule shows that 21.2 % of the booked hours were not used and 23.4 % were used by an average of two or fewer persons. The registration of the positions has been visually evaluated by comparing with manually annotated positions and shows great resemblance. DISCUSSION The results show that for nearly half the booked hours the arena was used by two or fewer persons. The observed sports arenas were booked by the local schools from 8 am to 3 pm during weekdays and booked by sports clubs in afternoons, evenings and weekends. This shows great potential for optimising the use of the sports arenas. Work is currently being done to optimise the precision of the detection software. Furthermore we work on including detection of activity type, activity level and user types. REFERENCES Brixen, S., Larsen, K. H., Lindholm, J. V., Nielsen, K. F., and Riiskjaer, S. (2010).

Hence, 3-D physical models possibly could be an alternative, cheaper option, for application in such countries.

An empirical study involving focus group discussions (FGDs) of transport users and rickshaw-pullers, was conducted in Dhaka City (Bangladesh). During the FGDs it was found that the use of a 3-D physical model was very helpful and useful for the participants to relate spatial contexts of the study area in the model; for discussing spatial aspects; for understanding the proposed development in the area; as well as effective facilitation of discussions.
