The paper also discusses issues in the worldwide and in Europe, and particularly in Catalonia, a Mediterranean country which has small fossil fuel deposits and has recently had periods of drought, making it necessary to watch over water consumption. This article proposes a brief methodological guide including five questions for the designer, or design team, to consider more environmental-friendly consumption alternatives. Ideally, these should be applied in the early conceptual design stage of any product for the entire world. A case study shows the work by a group of students of Creativity, Ecodesign and Patents subject (academic year 2012-13) entitled Rainwater storage system for blocks of flats.

This paper aims to find out the effect of railway on the modern urban structure and urban landscape in Iri(Iksan). Railways in Iri, Honam railway, Kunsan railway, Jeonla railway have been constructed progressively during 1911 and 1915 with Iri and old Iri(east-Iri) station. From the analysis of land registration maps and street plans, old photographies and historical records, some significant features underling railway construction can be followed in view of modern urbanization process in Iri. Firstly railways cut off the possibility of developing urban structure based on traditional spatial structure of Iksan. Secondly railways made dual spatial structure in Iri. Japanese and Korean life zone were divided into separate district around urbanization area and market place. Thirdly traditional space cognition system based on four cardinal directions were changed to front and rear space of railway station. Fourthly railways and stations caused neo-baroque spatial order and imperialistic urban landscape of Iri with axis, vista and gridiron plan.

The key question addressed in this paper is to what extent constructive details influence the constructional form and ultimately the quality of architectural projects. To this end Mies van der Rohe, one of the most significant exponents of Modern Architecture, was selected because of the precision and intensity with which he designed his work. In particular he paid enormously attention to the detail, which for Mies meant more than a mere technical corollary, but a way to accentuate the form. The non-built Library and Administration Building was elected as study case because of the large variety of the constructional details in all their dimensions and form elaborated in the multitude of drawings designed in preparation of the architectural project. According to Mies van der Rohe a project concretizes by the design of the constructional details. He considers the details as basic components in the concretization of the conception.

Architectural form and its supporting structure are results of interdependent design processes that do not always develop in harmony: often major outlines of architectural form are decided before structural design is involved. This doctoral work investigates design collaborations between architects and structural engineers in which architecture and structure are designed in mutual agreement, and structural design is able to guide and inspire a creation of  architectural form and space. The research is based on case studies derived from my practices as an independent structural engineer and a teacher of structures at Sint-Lucas School of Architecture. Participatory action research is applied to design collaborations in which I work as structural engineer together with architects and groups of architecture students. In different phases of design, collaborative design meetings are staged in which changes in the collaboration process and conceptual design communication are implemented and evaluated. Each evaluated change enables an improved understanding of design collaborations, and a design of more adapted changes to implement. This cyclic process of action research leads to a development of two sets of proposals for a structurally informed  architectural design process. A first set of proposals stimulates a mutually informed design collaboration through a cyclic process of information exchange in which a conceptual  design proposition is expressed as a wide range of possible design solutions by articulating its defining characteristics. This articulation of conceptual  design characteristics enables the architect and the structural engineer to negotiate for common design goals. A second part of my findings presents a proposal for a new structural language that organizes structural knowledge for architectural design. This language focuses on expressing structural logic as a defining characteristic of structural conceptual design propositions through its layers of structural order, function, dimensions and design possibilities.  These proposals for a mutually informed collaboration and a new structural language are applied and evaluated in both my practices. Inquiries show that architecture students appreciate the language to express structural behaviour, and that they relate to its underlying organization of structural knowledge. Analysing different design collaborations in both practices indicates that both sets of proposals enable structural design to guide and inspire architectural design.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W256032563"}}

The researcher developed four patterns and then constructed the residence\u2019s living furniture with slate material as the last design through satisfaction survey. The research was made by surveying four designs and gaining expert advices to improve and develop a new design with standardized uniqueness of shape and texture as to the natural design of slate and how to mix its construct with the kind of method. According to the satisfaction survey, all respondents (100%) returned questionnaire. It was found that they preferred the design 4 (55%), they used the living furniture 1-3 times/ week (47%), most of living furniture used was made from slate material in design 4 (55%) and it was attractive and had local uniqueness (47%), including most preferred in the residence (68%). The interesting form of design were products made of local slate material (40%), the interesting design for residence used was harmonized texture and color (35%), the most improved shape was structure design (40%). The new developed living furniture should gain good image and could compete with products in the market as design 4 (50%), whereas its utilization for satisfaction as efficiency (47%), and different design (45%). Considering the effectiveness of four patterns of living furniture from 100 respondents in order to finalize the last one to develop, it was found that the pattern 1 gained at good level (X=3.96), the pattern 2 gained at the good level (X=4.21), the pattern 3 gained at good level (X=3.43), and the pattern 4 gained at good level (X=4.24). Finally, the second of developed living furniture design with slate materia(as pattern 5) was evaluated by twenty of 5-year experts. The results revealed that this pattern was sufficient as to criteria of design, production and utilization. In addition, customers\u2019 satisfaction on design including production of material, process, physical and beauty utilization was at a good level as well.

To slow down the increasing environmental degradation, design for sustainable behaviour (DfSB) has emerged in sustainable design aiming to promote behavioural change through design innovations to reduce environmental and social impacts from the demand side or consumer side. This paper presents a practice-based journey to investigate the process and results of the application of social-psychological theories into sustainable design. Focusing on the behaviour-related impacts of products and services during the use stage, a Design Behaviour Intervention Model (DBIM) is developed through the analysis and synthesis of the social-psychological theories and behaviour-changing strategies. The DBIM indicates that an in-depth study of consumer behaviour is the preliminary step in DfSB, which determines the application of design strategies and potentially the effectiveness of design interventions. A case study is presented to demonstrate the application of the model. The results show that consumer behaviour insights offer rich resources to assist designers in sustainable design innovation. Product-based design suggestions and a proposed solution highlight that the application of DBIM coupled with consumer involvement throughout the design process could produce desirable and sustainable patterns of household fridge use.

IntroductionThis study focuses on how designers can collaborate with local craftspeople to expand the market potential of a local craft. It also explores the types of contributions that designers can make to artisan communities. Local craft is a reflection of the relationship between humans and their environment within their historical, cultural, and social contexts. Pre-industrial artisans were skilled craftspeople who used locally available materials to create products and generate income. As similar products manufactured with alternative or new materials were introduced to the market the demand for traditional craftsmanship sharply declined. Mechanization and mass production led to a shift in the production system from customized artisanship to large-scale generic production. To compete with mass produced products, artisans generally must sell their individually handmade work at lower prices. Greenhalgh (2003, p. 6) indicates that crafts straddle between the art and design economies and often get the worst of both worlds. The artists naturally make a living by selling their handmade objects at a profitable margin, and the designers make a living by designing objects that go into mass-production. Considering that their craft products lack the prestige of art or the reproducibility of product design, craftspeople often have to resort to selling their unique works at mass production prices. Meanwhile, traditional crafts, involving practices rooted in local knowledge and accumulated over time, are part of our cultural heritage and should be preserved and revitalized. Designers are called upon to bridge the gap between idea and practice, and to link artistic and creative elements with practical and realizable outcomes (Dodgson, Gann, & Salter, 2005). Accordingly, organizations like the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Crafts Council (WCC), and Aid to Artisans (ATA) have made efforts to bring traditional crafts into mainstream life. Such efforts include engaging designers to work with artisan groups to develop new product lines for new markets.From the perspective of promoting regional competitiveness through cultural industry, developing products based on cultural heritage and local resources can invigorate local economic development (Santagata, 2002). A growing niche market for unique and authentic products has emerged from the homogeneous globalization-driven market (McIntyre, 2010). Products reflecting local identity or highlighting cultural value offer a form of differentiation in an increasingly converging market (Lin, 2007; Moalosi, Popovic, & Hickling-Hudson, 2007). For this reason, culturally connected local crafts are in a particularly strong position to respond to this trend. Imbuing products with authentic characteristics by adapting features from local crafts could be a strategy to develop products which reflect differentiation and self-expression. Such products may fill a unique niche and build identity in the global market (Dillon, 2008). When local cultural assets receive attention, areas experiencing economic downturn, or industry sectors where local crafts are neglected, have promising prospects for economic revival. In Asia, the concept of 'One Village One Product (OVOP)' movements, originating in Japan and promoted in numerous Asian countries, encourages local residents to manufacture distinctive products to aid in their regional economic development through collaboration with experts in relevant fields, thereby adding value to locally available resources (Rana, 2008). Inspired by the OVOP movement, a division of the Taiwanese government, the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration, has launched Taiwan's 'One Town One Product (OTOP)' program to promote distinctive local products. It has also organized the Taiwan OTOP Design Award since 2007. The objectives are to encourage alliances between craftspeople and designers, to bring public awareness to regionally specialized industries, and to apply respective design aesthetics. \u2026", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W271077549"}}

The creative process is a multifaceted and dynamic path of thinking required to execute a project in design-based disciplines. The goal of this research was to test a model outlining the creative design process by investigating student experiences in a design project assignment. The study used an exploratory design to collect data from student demographic information, journal responses, and external evaluations of creative product results. Thirty-six senior level interior design students participated in the assignment where students were asked to design a scale model of a lounge chair and to journal in responses to pre-determined question prompts regarding their activities. Design deliverables were reviewed by external evaluators to identify level of creative output which resulted in identifying groups of high and low creativity. Results revealed that students in the high creativity group, as compared to those in the low creativity group, demonstrated higher levels of abstract thought, greater divergent thinking, increased depth in thought, and higher motivation throughout their creative process. The proposed model was supported by the data. Introduction Creativity has always been at the heart of (Amabile & Khaire, 2008, p. 100). Popular press and scholarly journals highlight the importance of creativity and innovation to modern business organizations (Driver, 2001; Jeanes, 2006). Creative thinking is especially important to design firms (e.g., architecture, interior design, graphic design, landscape architecture, and industrial design), demonstrating design as an inherently creative pursuit (Lawson, 1997; Portillo, 2002). On an individual level in times of economic uncertainty, entry level designers can use a competitive edge in seeking employment. Their potential creative value to their respective workplaces can be a critical factor in candidate selection. Increased understanding of students' creative processes could be utilized in the classroom to more effectively train students to demonstrate creative thinking. A challenge is to concretely identify decision-making patterns distinguishing creative problem solutions from those that simply solve the problem. The purpose of this study was twofold: to connect actions with outcomes to determine a best fit sequence for creative problem solving and to test a proposed conceptual creative process model drawn from Amabile's (1996) Computational Model of Creativity. Although a relationship between creativity and success in the design industry can be identified, there remains a lack of clarity about the design process and terminology regarding creativity. The process of design is not transparent regarding how designers make decisions, what steps are taken and in what order, and even by what terms are used to define these steps. Substantial disagreement continues concerning how designers produce designs. Dorst and Dijkhuis (1995) suggested two basic and fundamentally different ways of approaching the design process: the Rational Model and the Action-Centric Perspective. In the rational model, a sequence of phases occur which are not actual steps followed by designers in conducting works, but a representation of phases through which the design process progresses. In contrast, the action-centric model finds designers using creativity and emotion to generate design ideas through improvised processes with no apparent universal stages. Empirical studies have been conducted on the creative process, but none have utilized reflective first person accounts. The majority of research efforts were conducted in which the creator was recorded or had to speak aloud (Lawson, 1997). In other studies, researchers analyzed drawings and gestures (Dorst, 1995; Krueger & Cross, 2006). The first methodology can make it difficult for a student to verbally account for their own processes while actively engaged in a design problem, and neither gestures nor drawings alone can fully account for the actual steps and sequences taken during the creative process. \u2026", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W38363372"}}

Among the community-based cultural facilities, public libraries are places for social and educational purpose that improve the education of the resident, the expansion of the basic cultural education, communication between the members of society, and the accumulations and preservations of the culture. Public libraries should be a local cultural facility that expresses the value of a community. This study aims to analyze the design expression of publicness in a public branch library as a community-based cultural space through the study of branch library in the U.S. This study focused on the most future-oriented and innovative Ten New Landmark Libraries in the United States selected by Library Journal magazine in 2011. Among the selected libraries, three branch libraries which belongs Arizona Maricopa County were included in the study. The results of this study are as follows. First, the sites of the branch libraries vary geographically, but the libraries increase accessibility are caused by unique appearances and design concept of intellectual interest. Second, the floor plan shows the separation of meeting rooms and faculty space from the public space and has visual and spatial open space by high ceiling of the reading room. Third, multi-functional public space for residents are meeting rooms, the external patios for reading, galleries, cafes, libraries-shops which provides a variety of cultural programs, activities, and the opportunity to socialize neighbors. Fourth, branch Libraries have unique designs that harmonizes with nearby places to reflect locality, giving the locals a sense of pride in their community. Fifth, concrete brick and metal panel were used as finishing material for the practicality of maintenance.

Among the community-based cultural facilities, public libraries are places for social and educational purpose that improve the education of the resident, the expansion of the basic cultural education, communication between the members of society, and the accumulations and preservations of the culture. Public libraries should be a local cultural facility that expresses the value of a community. This study aims to analyze the design expression of publicness in a public branch library as a community-based cultural space through the study of branch library in the U.S. This study focused on the most future-oriented and innovative Ten New Landmark Libraries in the United States selected by Library Journal magazine in 2011. Among the selected libraries, three branch libraries which belongs Arizona Maricopa County were included in the study. The results of this study are as follows. First, the sites of the branch libraries vary geographically, but the libraries increase accessibility are caused by unique appearances and design concept of intellectual interest. Second, the floor plan shows the separation of meeting rooms and faculty space from the public space and has visual and spatial open space by high ceiling of the reading room. Third, multi-functional public space for residents are meeting rooms, the external patios for reading, galleries, cafes, libraries-shops which provides a variety of cultural programs, activities, and the opportunity to socialize neighbors. Fourth, branch Libraries have unique designs that harmonizes with nearby places to reflect locality, giving the locals a sense of pride in their community. Fifth, concrete brick and metal panel were used as finishing material for the practicality of maintenance.

The objective of this study was to design and evaluate a kitchen for persons with visual impairments. Before designing the kitchen, interviews and an observation were carried out to obtain information on the needs of blind and low vision persons. Consequently, a kitchen model was developed, and it was evaluated by 10 persons with visual impairments. After the design improvement, the kitchen was built and has been routinely used for training persons with visual impairments to prepare meals. Finally, a post-occupancy evaluation of the kitchen was conducted by observing and interviewing both trainers and those with visual impairments during the food preparation training. The results of the study indicated that kitchens for persons with visual impairments should have safety and usability features.

Conclusions from this study are as follows. First, concept of quad and center space found in the design of traditional campus is reinterpreted into new design aspects through development of underground space. Second, development of underground space is approached to overcome the limit of existing campus and to present the vision of universities 100 years ahead. Third, ever-changing complicated urban environment has been reflected in space configuration of campus and positioned as strategy to implement this as modern construction technique. Third, implementation of pedestrian-oriented campus has been pursued by reinforcing utilization of inclined topography of urban environment in Korea.

This paper shows that the production, with about 56% of the GWP of a notebook has a significantly higher impact than the use phase. Moreover, GWP of the production of a notebook are so high, that they cannot be compensated in realistic time-periods by energy efficiency gains of new products. The paper recommends decision-makers to give attention to hardware upgrading, modular and repair-friendly product design, availability of spare parts, standardisation of components and minimum warranty periods while defining mandatory product policy for ICT.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1525504588"}}

Firstly, the concept of green feature is proposed to describe information of green design. Then, through exploration of the mapping relationship between traditional design information and green feature, the information expression model which is easy to extract green features is established. Lastly, the LCA idea is introduced to design process and is combined with green feature, thus the green features in traditional design are identified, selected, classified and aggregated and the green feature-based modeling can be realized. The feedback of rapid life cycle assessment results can be conducted real time and green design is embedded into traditional design, which can improve environmental attributes of mechanical and electrical products.

However, the resources of our planet are limited, as is the strain to which we can subject it in terms of emissions, pollution, and disposal of waste. For these reasons, finding ways to lower the environmental footprint of our collective existence and therefore lowering greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate climate change is a vital priority ([1], [2]).

Abstract This study aims to investigate the relationship between ergonomic comfort and the provision of accessibility features for mobility\u2010impaired persons in the use of public transportation systems in Korea. To deal with mobility issues in a public transportation environment, we chose the low\u2010floor bus as our research subject because it is the representative of a barrier\u2010free design solution. We collected data via video observation, which can overcome the limitations of traditional accessibility\u2010focused studies and laboratory studies by providing data on real usage patterns. We developed a framework to analyze the gathered data which includes user, space, tools, activities, and context. As a result, we observed existing difficulties of mobility\u2010impaired persons in terms of moving and supporting their bodies on the bus, despite the application of accessibility features. Furthermore, the design only for accessibility of mobility\u2010disabled persons can cause unexpected predicaments for the passengers who do not have physical handicaps. Drawing on these findings, we concluded that the concept of universal design in public transportation environments must be introduced in Korea. This study suggests video observation as a useful methodology for collecting data in dynamic environments. Additionally, our study is expected to contribute to how the concept of universal design can be implemented, and stimulate issues for ergonomic research based on our behavior pattern analysis.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1909168714"}}

During the 2000s there were changes in the educational facility policy having impact on school architecture, such as departmental classroom system by the 7th national curriculum and BTL projects. Especially for secondary school architecture with the new keyword of 'departmental classroom system' unlike elementary school with the well-known keyword of 'open classroom', the emergence of new school architecture was anticipated. For these reasons it is worth while to notice secondary school architecture in the 2000s and this study aims to review the architectural characteristics of middle schools as first step. Cases of 18 schools selected by EDUMAC were analyzed focused on site planning and planning characteristics of each spaces. Through the analysis, the architectural characteristics of middle schools in the 2000s are summarized and comments on some problems are made. In summary, case schools have typical characteristics of Korean school architecture in unit classrooms and block plan for daylight condition. On the other hand, they have more diversity in space organization and facility program. But it leave something to be desired in expressing urban architectural characteristics, traditionality and locality with searching for new school architecture.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2095439564"}}

Every year, international design award giving bodies announce the winners of their design competitions, celebrating and promoting them to the public as exemplars of \"good design\" or \"design excellence\". Winners are commended on the basis of innovation, form, function, quality, safety, and ecological sustainability. This latter criterion questions if there is real need for the product, if it reduces environmental impact, has a long lifetime, is resource efficient, complies with environmental best practice, considers end-of-life issues, uses principles of design for disassembly and recyclability, ethical, and offers benefit to society, environment, culture and economy. This paper investigates the approaches by which design award winners and finalists claim to respond to the sustainability criterion. It also traces winners to as far as ten years back and checks whether they exhibit market longevity; that is, if they are still around or if they have already been discontinued or replaced by other products. The archives of the most popular awards in which most designers aim to be recognized in were consulted, and a content analysis was conducted against the definitions and conditions for sustainable product innovation. The study found that product design accolades do their job well in highlighting the excellent work of industrial designers and the manufacturers they work with. However, given the urgency of climate change and environmental disasters that are attributed to the impacts of not-so-responsible designs, it is sensible to rethink whether those in product development should continue pursuing the market oriented approach of offering consumers endless streams of award-winning material \"stuff\" to own. As the analyses show, designers and manufacturers are indeed capable of creating excellent solutions that are ecologically sustainable. While the proportion of such innovations is still low in comparison to the rest of the awarded products, it is promising to see growth in this area.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2920896552"}}

To \u2018sustain\u2019 is not only about keeping up, supporting or maintaining continuity but also is about nourishing, cultivation and acknowledgement. 21st century incentives in all fields of human endeavour have replaced sustainability measures in their plans and actions as a necessity for meeting the needs of the present and future generations. Green engineering and design perspectives state the importance of carrying out an inventory of all the materials and energy used in the design process and assessing all the environmental discharges resulting from the product's manufacture, use, and disposal. Being cyberized or virtual does not leave distance education apart; still it is a product designed to serve actual human beings and alike every design, the process has inputs, outputs and unfortunately, produces waste. Unless managed properly, waste is harmful; to avoid possible harms and to be able to respond both to current and future demands and expectations, distance education has to include ecological and sustainable perspectives to its vision.

This study is purposed to understand the color usage of space programming in detail for architectural design. Many documents have commonly prescribed the spacial composition for this library. The space program and function in the public library have changed with the new media and digital information system. The solution includes digitally storing information and creating space specifically designated for books that can be expanded without encroaching on public space. The Seattle public library was designed by Rem Koolhaas. He offered the first glimpses of Seattles new central library rather than a conventional high-rise building with straight. He pushed and pulled out the floor and elevation, creating an angular effect. In particular, the Seattle public library was composed of the five stable space that has simple function and the four unstable space that has complex function to figure out the complicate zoning program in variable space. Each of the five stable spaces is a programmatic cluster that is architecturally defined and equipped for maximum, dedicated performance. The four unstable spaces in between the function as trading floors where librarian inform and simulate, where the interface between the different platforms is organized. The two types space was expressed with different color system that has basic criteria which function has unique color. So the unstable space having complex function was painted variable colors that were explaining their function.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1613802456"}}

To this end, I surveyed 83 colleges and categorized those colleges based on their school system and academic field where the college is included. First, according to the school system I classified them into 2-, 3-, 4-year course. Then, I categorized each of them into subcategories based on their fields; 2 year course into Design field and Construction Engineering field, 3 year course into Construction, Engineering and Design, 4 year course into Design, Life Science, Engineering and Construction. Referring to a Classified table of majors and fields by KIID, I reorganized them into ten big categories: \u2460Design Theory \u2461Design Technique \u2462Interior Composition Elements \u2463Basic Practice \u2464Advanced Practice \u2465Psychology and Behaviour \u2466Design Management \u2467History of Interior Design \u2468Digital Design \u2469 Communication.

Similarly, information architecture for a website requires understanding of who the users will be and how they will use the site, what options should be provided, maintenance and expansion plans and budget.

The authors answer the questions: What is sustainable product development and why is it important? What are the main drivers of sustainable product development? They explain how design can help to control human impact on the environment by not only minimising pollution, waste, energy use and use of scarce resources, but also by thinking outside the box to create systems and services that can reduce the number of products manufactured. The aim is to put sustainable development within a commercial context and introduce a new focus for design.Design for Sustainability outlines and assesses the methods, tools and techniques available to designers, both for design innovation and design improvement. A wide range of case studies are presented across a number of product sectors including electrical goods, IT and furniture. Initially they demonstrate product improvement and redesign, examples include those that reduce waste, pollution and energy consumption, designing for recycling and reuse of parts.

The sensations and the meanings rendered from the experience of an architectural atmosphere depend directly on the inhabitant. The architect, helped on multiple disciplines, lay out a wide palette of resources to characterize an abstract space and turn it into a singular one. Normally, the architect works with all the sensory possibilities that can interact between the architecture and the inhabitant. In consequence, the architectural atmosphere turns into something special with the power to influence his user. Nevertheless, the capacity to be moved by an architectural atmosphere also depends on the cultural, perceptive and psychological capacities of the individuals.

Summary A model is presented for calculating the environmental burdens of the part manufacturing and vehicle assembly (VMA) stage of the vehicle life cycle. The model is based on a process\u2010level approach, accounting for all significant materials by their transformation processes (aluminum castings, polyethylene blow molding; etc.) and plant operation activities (painting; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning [HVAC], etc.) germane to VMA. Using quantitative results for these material/transformation process pairings, a percent\u2010by\u2010weight material/transformation distribution (MTD) function was developed that permits the model to be applied to a range of vehicles, both conventional and advanced (e.g., hybrid electric, light weight, aluminum intensive). Upon consolidation of all inputs, the model reduces to two terms: one proportional to vehicle mass and a plant overhead per vehicle term. When the model is applied to a materially well\u2010characterized conventional vehicle, reliable estimates of cumulative energy consumption (34 gigajoules/vehicle) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions (2 tonnes/vehicle) with coefficients of variation are computed for the VMA life cycle stage. Due to the more comprehensive coverage of manufacturing operations, our energy estimates are on the higher end of previously published values. Nonetheless, they are still somewhat underestimated due to a lack of data on overhead operations in part manufacturing facilities and transportation of parts and materials between suppliers and vehicle manufacturing operations. For advanced vehicles, the material/transformation process distribution developed above needs some adjusting for different materials and components. Overall, energy use and CO 2 emissions from the VMA stage are about 3.5% to 4.5% of total life cycle values for vehicles.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1551445080"}}

However, uncertainties and multiple and conflicting objectives are inherent in such a design process. Green engineering principles are illustrated here using a green energy sector case study. Uncertainties increase further in industrial ecology. The concept of overall sustainability goes beyond industrial ecology and brings in time dependent nature of the ecosystem and multi-disciplinary decision making. Optimal control methods and theories from financial literature can be useful in handling the time dependent uncertainties in this problem. Decision making at various stages starting from green plant design, green energy, to industrial ecology, and sustainability is illustrated for the mercury cycling.

The topic is related to the phase coming usually after the acquisition of the data, during the construction of the model and especially after, when designers must have an interaction with the simulation, in order to develop and verify their idea. In the case of study, the concept of interaction includes the concept of real time \"flows\". The work develops contents and results that can be part of the large debate about the current connection between \"architecture\" and \"movement\". The focus of the work, is to realize a collaborative and participative virtual environment on which different specialist actors, client and final users can share knowledge, targets and constraints to better gain the aimed result. The goal is to have used a dynamic micro simulation digital resource that allows all the actors to explore the model in powerful and realistic way and to have a new type of interaction in a complex architectural scenario.

Eco-design heuristics (defined as experience-based techniques for problem solving) can play a useful role in helping designers prioritize eco-design strategies.

Within the higher education sector there has been progress incorporating or embedding sustainable development concepts into the engineering and design curriculum. Despite guidance from the Engineering Council and other institutions highlighting the wider qualitative aspects these are largely ignored within engineering and design education in favour of the more quantitative environmental and economic impact methodologies. To promote student understanding and engagement with the concepts of sustainable development an introductory primer was developed utilising both PBL and PAL methods. The course was delivered to mixed groups of first and second year BSc Design Engineering students during the first week of 3 consecutive academic years. The first course examined a product of clear social usefulness and the barriers to consumer acceptance in unfamiliar markets. The second utilised design analysis for technical understanding before students differentiated between product types through functional service, social value and material utilisation. The third included students drawn from BA Design Business Management. The foci were up-stream resource supply elements that threaten enterprise resilience rather than the customer perspective. The outputs identified a clear transition of understanding amongst the students for each of the primer courses.

Sustainable product design has been considered as one of the most important practices for achieving sustainability. To improve the environmental performances of a product through product design, however, a firm often needs to deal with some difficult technical trade-offs between traditional and environmental attributes which require new design concepts and engineering specifications. In this paper, we propose a novel use of the two-stage network Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate sustainable product design performances. We conceptualize \u201cdesign efficiency\u201d as a key measurement of design performance in terms of how well multiple product specifications and attributes are combined in a product design that leads to lower environmental impacts or better environmental performances. A two-stage network DEA model is developed for sustainable design performance evaluation with an \u201cindustrial design module\u201d and a \u201cbio design module.\u201d To demonstrate the applications of our DEA-based methodology, we use data of key engineering specifications, product attributes, and emissions performances in the vehicle emissions testing database published by the US EPA to evaluate the sustainable design performances of different automobile manufacturers. Our test results show that sustainable design does not need to mean compromise between traditional and environmental attributes. Through addressing the interrelatedness of subsystems in product design, a firm can find the most efficient way to combine product specifications and attributes which leads to lower environmental impacts or better environmental performances. This paper contributes to the existing literature by developing a new research framework for evaluating sustainable design performances as well as by proposing an innovative application of the two-stage network DEA for finding the most eco-efficient way to achieve better environmental performances through product design.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2096884817"}}

The main purpose for this study is to further develop knowledge of design education. Design has a wide impact on society, seen in a consumer perspective in light of sustainability issues. Design education \u2013 from primary to university level \u2013 is in this project regarded as a key issue for developing a sustainable society as the choices general public take when it comes to design, touches the core of consumerism. In the Kyoto Design Declaration, The International Association of Universities and Colleges of Art, Design and Media (Cumulus) declared that \u2026to contribute to sustainable social, environmental, cultural and economic development for current and future generations, the Cumulus members will commit themselves to accepting their part in the further education of our youth within a value system where each of us recognizes our global responsibility to build sustainable, human-centred, creative societies. Worldwide environmental problems are closely linked to an increasing amount of waste and pollution related to the production, transportation and consumption of artefacts. Designers, decision makers, investors and consumers hold different positions in the design process, but they all make choices that will influence our future environment. In order to solve some of the crucial global challenges, designers and lay people must cooperate; for this purpose, awareness of design qualities from a sustainable perspective is necessary. We include such an awareness of quality, longevity and sustainability in the design process of artefacts and solutions in our understanding of design literacy. It refers to concerns and practices such as democratic participation in the processes, developing and using ethical responsibility, and understanding and supporting sustainable aspects of production and consumption.  We have chosen to use the concept \u2018design literacy\u2019 to address the complex matter of objectives and content in design education at the primary, lower secondary, upper secondary, and university levels. In selecting this term, we acknowledge that research on multiple literacies has received considerable debate and redefinition within several areas of educational research (Coiro et al., 2008); it is no longer bound to the understanding of literacy as the ability to read and write verbal text (Moats, 2000). We draw on work in areas such as visual literacy (Stankiewicz, 2003), media literacy (Buckingham, 2003; Erstad, 2010), and ecological literacy (Stegall, 2006). Design literacy in this project is connected both to the creation and understanding of artefacts and images in a broad sense, and is not limited to only graphic design (Heller, 2004). When we use design literacy in this project, we include a wide perspective of artefacts and professions and choose a broad interpretation of design (Simon 1969). There is a move toward understanding design products and processes as composed of symbiotic hybrids between design products, media types, services, architecture, communicative spaces, networks and modes of creation, production, and exchange (Knutsen & Morrison, 2010). We regard design literacy as a competence not only for the professional designer, but also for lay people in their position as users, decision makers, and consumers.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2772676397"}}

In his article \"The Instrumentality of Gibson's Medium as an Alternative to Space\" Raymond Lucas analyzes the alternative to space presented by James J. Gibson and the potential role of narrative in a more holistic process of design. The concept of space exerts a powerful influence on architecture, urban design, and other disciplines concerned with the environment. Many recent critiques have measured space against place, recognizing the deficit in memory and identification within space, but the problems with the concept are more deeply felt. Understanding the medium rather than space offers architects and theorists opportunities to examine the role of the full range of senses, weather, and temporal effects such as the seasonal or daily cycle, and even technological modalities such as surveillance, safety, and connectivity. This shift in understanding allows for a fuller representation of architectural experience. Rather than seeing architecture as firm, solid, and complete, it is possible to represent an architecture of context, conditionality and flux. Architecture is experienced through all of our senses, active and attentive, as well as distracted and passive. Lucas demonstrates aspects of the sensory notation system and its associated narration of space in urban design.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2584801321"}}

An architectural project, St John stated, 'is far more likely to work well if you put an enormous effort into defining what you want, to achieve quality\u2019. At Caruso St John Architects' 2006 entrance addition to the Victoria and Albert Museum of Childhood in Bethnal Green, London [1], the precise specification of mortar and mastic joints throughout a cut-stone facade was employed to define expectations of quality in the constructed facade. These specifications, written in accordance with the recommendations of professional practice, set out stringent expectations of dimensional perfection. When dimensional variations during design development and construction threatened to disrupt these expectations, the precise definition of quality shifted, becoming less defined by dimensional perfection and more reliant upon the \u2018architectural intentions\u2019 underpinning the project. In referencing conceptual, ideological, historical and technological intentions which were difficult definitively to express, this critical phrase \u2013 \u2018architectural intentions\u2019 \u2013 is examined here in terms of its ambiguity in the context of the written specification [2].

As a result of analysis of such questionnaires this author could draw following conclusion. In the second half of 1990s pavement materials which were used mainly were sand and during first half of 2000s they were mixture of sand and rubber block and around 2010 they were rubber block or rubber chip pavements. Such change seemed to be a result of consideration of convenience for management and safety rather than in deference to diversity of children's outing places.

And there was need for their coping with problems such as pressure of treading or lack of it or poor condition of drainage in case of sand and phenomena of pitting or dipping down, discoloring and poor drainage in case of rubber chips and rubber blocks and loosening of gaps between rubber blocks etc. Result of analysing status of usage disclosed that 50.4% of the respondents to questionnaires stated that they had experience of accidents. With regard to cause of such accident it was found that 47.5% of accidents were attributable to play facilities and 19.5% were due to paving (floor) materials thus it was disclosed that not only play facilities but also pavement materials had impact on safety for the children. Result of analysing level of satisfaction with pavement materials showed that pavement by rubber chips and blocks had higher level of satisfaction which was reflection of fear on cleanness of sand. In terms of preference rubber chip and rubber block pavements were highest and the next one was sand. Reason for such preference was based on concern with safety.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2023131116"}}

According to Environment psychology, current playground elevation should be lowered 2 stair-long height from a classroom site. This kind of elevation change can remove unnecessary stairs, and reduces inconvenience incurred by stairs and edges, which results in considerable educational finance saving. Second, the incidental equipment within a playground needs to be improved. This fact is found out at the surveyed schools; school gathering is held at classrooms (through broadcasting) or a multi-purpose auditorium in place of a playground.

This study examined the concept-forming process of Design-Art and based on it, drew the significance of Design-Art. Design-Art is generated by the policy cultivating star artists and star designers so as to pioneer new art-market in 1990s in the foundation of anti-area formed by Postmodernism in 1960s. It started to be vitalized while designers were born as author. At the same time, because of the information's popularity by internet's propagation, users started to manufacture and propagate contents volunteerly. Meanwhile, designers accepted artistic value so as to guarantee independent position, so the area of Design-Art became more strengthened. Therefore, Design-Art means 'design as an art' and Design-Artist obtained general meaning, 'designer as an author'. In 2000s, it secured variety because of the acceptance of existing art galleries' Design-Art works and forming of new Design-Art market such as Design-Art fair, and vitalization of the market played its own roles with the movement to create new-concept of design in design ecology. Based on the contents, this paper analyzed Design-Art works by Design-Artists working actively in actual field and examined the possibility of future development of Design-Art.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1981643770"}}

The architectural imagery that you create is most effective when it examines your project in an abstract manner. Most students and practitioners understand linear perspective and cinema to be examples of architectural presentation tools. This book asks you to consider drawings and movies to be analytical tools that give you the capacity to engage all phases of the design process, from parti to presentation.  The ways in which spaces relate to each other and how materials connect to each other in your projects are as important as your building\u2019s appearance. As digital tools increasingly allow you to simulate the experience of built and unbuilt environments, it is essential that you scrutinize the nature of architectural imagery and resist the lure of virtual reality. Though pure simulation may be appropriate for your clients, your design process requires abstraction and analysis.  Author Thomas Forget demonstrates how to construct analytical drawings and movies that challenge the alleged realism of linear perspective and cinema. These demonstrations expose you to underlying principles that will allow you to understand the broader implications of these methods. In addition, historical surveys of drawings and movies provide you with insight into how architects and architectural historians have understood the role of linear perspective and cinema in their fields. Finally, examples of drawing and moviemaking strategies illustrate how you can apply the lessons of the book to precedent analyses and design projects.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2901403448"}}

In particular, studio surfaces such as designers' desks, office walls, notice boards, clipboards and drawing boards are full of informative, inspirational and creative artefacts such as, sketches, drawings, posters, story-boards and Post-it notes. Studio surfaces are not just the carriers of information but importantly they are sites of methodic design practices, i.e. they indicate, to an extent, how design is being carried out. This article describes the results of an ethnographic study on the use of workplace surfaces in design studios, from two academic design departments.

In recent years, environmentally conscious design has become a fundamental approach for industries which have to consider the variable environment during the design process. Waste management is one of the most important aspects to be handled, to reduce the disposal in landfills and to encourage the sustainable 3R approach: Reuse, Recycling and Remanufacturing. Product disassembly is an essential phase of the product lifecycle, necessary to evaluate the End-of-Life (EoL) strategies and to reduce environmental impact. In order to minimize the impact on production and costs it is very important to consider EoL scenarios during the embodiment design phase, when designer\u2019s decisions influence product structure. Design for Disassembly (DFD) is a powerful method to reduce disassembly time and costs. However, there are no useful tools which provide guidelines to improve the product disassemblability or promote specific EoL scenarios. For these reasons this paper describes an innovative Design for Disassembly approach and related tool to support designers in product disassemblability evaluation. The tool has the scope to manage EoL scenarios for industrial waste in the early design phases and to share metadata with the traditional design tools. Disassembly costs is one of the most important parameters during the evaluation of EoL scenarios. Six indices are presented to evaluate the economic and environmental feasibility of the EoL strategies. The calculation of the six indices permits alternative EoL scenarios to be compared and encourage the recyclability, reusability or re-manufacturability of a product. These evaluations can be used to foster a particular EoL scenario, as early on as in the design process. The preliminary analysis on mechatronic products underline the utility of the software tool and indices. Product re-design, realized using this approach, shows a relevant decrease in environmental impacts and disassembly costs. As a consequence, the new product has a relevant percentage of components with a closed-loop lifecycle.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2019857337"}}

For designers it is difficult to pin-point the design characteristics that could be changed to reduce the environmental impact of their products. This paper describes a method for determining the design characteristics that have a significant relationship with environmental impact that arises at product end-of-life. In this method, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Linear Regression Analysis (LRA) are combined. LCA is used to quantify the environmental impact of products from the extraction of their raw materials to their disposal. LRA is used to determine the design characteristics that have the most significant relationship with environmental impact. Combining LCA and LRA gives the designer the ability to (1) establish a relationship between design characteristics and their environmental impact, (2) determine the most significant design characteristics that influence environmental impact, and (3) validate design changes with their influence on product environmental impact. In the case study described here, the design characteristic, Volume, is shown to have significant relationship with the end-of-life environmental impact of cellular phones. This trend is consistent with the results of the one-phase end-of-life disposition assessments that evaluated disassembled cellular phones. With the results of this method, designers can focus their sustainable design efforts on modifying and improving the design characteristics that have the strongest relationship with environmental impact.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2015952432"}}

As more products compete in the global marketplace, it is increasingly important to bring cultural and societal issues into engineering education to help contextualize design decisions. When product dissection activities are used to contextualize these decisions, they focus primarily on function, form, and fabrication, failing to highlight the importance of cultural influences that can impact global product design. The paradigm of product archaeology has been developed to address the shortcomings of product dissection activities and create inductive learning activities that help students better contextualize their engineering design knowledge. Inspired by the findings in our own rice cooker dissection and analysis, an experiment is conducted to evaluate the incorporation of rice cookers into product archaeology activities in a product dissection course. The purpose of adding rice cookers to the consumer goods section of the course is to expose students to the cultural issues of rice cooker design (e.g., product functions and features based on cooking and dietary needs).

Purpose The office is considered as a strategic resource that can support knowledge\u2010based organisations to gain competitive advantage and operational efficiency. Although the modern scholar emphasises the role of user involvement in workplace design and management, there is little evidence showing how it can be linked to occupancy cost performance. The purpose of this paper is to investigate benefits of a user\u2010centric workplace practice by focusing on working time and space utilisation practice of office users. Design/methodology/approach A scenario\u2010based approach was designed to analyse office occupancy cost performance. A questionnaire survey was conducted from a number of UK\u2010based offices to create three workspace utilisation scenarios, namely, existing, property\u2010centric and user\u2010centric. Key comparison criteria include potential areas of savings, potential total cost savings and cost saving per person. Findings It was found that a user\u2010centric approach reflects an opportunity to save annual occupancy costs in terms of total costs and cost per person where users indicated how they utilised working time and space. In return, the organisations can gain more productivity from office users who are likely to perform better when they can work in the preferred workplace practice. Practical implications By adopting this approach, organisations can understand the occupancy characteristics of the offices from multi perspectives, leading to better management in office premises.

The term design in this paper particularly refers to the process (verb) and less to the outcome or product. Design comprises a complex set of activities today involving both man and machine. Sustainability is a fundamental paradigm and carries significance in any process, natural or manmade, and its outcome. In simple terms, sustainability implies a state of sustainable living, viz. health and continuity, nurtured by diversity and evolution (innovations) in an ever-changing world. Design, in a similar line, has been comprehensively investigated and its current manifestations including design-aids (Computer Aided Design) have been evaluated in terms of sustainability. The paper investigates the rationale of sustainability to design as a whole \u2013 its purpose, its adoption in the natural world, its relevance to humankind and the technologies involved. Throughout its history, technology has been used to aid design. But in the current context of advanced algorithms and computational capacity, design no longer remains an exclusively animate faculty. Given this scenario, investigating sustainability in the light of advanced design aids such as CAD becomes pertinent. Considering that technology plays a part in design activities, the paper explores where technology must play a part and to what degree amongst the various activities that comprise design. The study includes an examination of the morphology of design and the development of a systems-thinking integrated forecasting model to evaluate the implications of CAD tools in design and sustainability.

The authors start by describing the materiality of tactile tiles, their functions, and physical attributes and how they can communicate useful spatial information through new signs and codes to support a safer orientation when visual information is lacking. Territory production, materiality, and appropriation of space are addressed based on the existence of the legal mandatory application of accessibility laws, public service attributions, local spatial configurations, and potential different user interpretations. These questions are illustrated by the multiple immaterial questions that arise from these new objects\u2019 local applications.

Architectural education has always represented a complex epistemological issue. On the one hand, the discipline brings together different types of social, cultural and technical knowledge, necessarily linked to its context, and thus with established, structured guidelines, rules and precepts, although these are adaptable. On the other hand, all this supply of knowledge is organised through a creative action, design, which at the same time involves open logics which are not always previously established, innovative aspects and flexible guidelines, often leading to new configurations or unconventional, unknown orders. To design includes a process of synthesis deriving from applied knowledge, ie, knowledge put into action; thus, whilst learning, it is important for each of the specific skills and logics involved to be articulated and in balance, so that significant solutions, adapted to their context, can be produced, rather than mere technicism or abstractions divorced from concrete reality. Heritage offers a pedagogical resource for dealing with several areas of content typical of architectural design courses, highlighting important aspects such as the consideration of cultural and symbolic dimensions, training in the built environment and its technical, constructional, programmatic and methodological offshoots, and the need to think creatively about the enhancement of habitat and its future possibilities.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2044662748"}}

Accessibility considerations tend to dominate discussions about disability and the built environment. Although many architects object to the constraints of accessibility regulations, the shallow ramps, wide passages, and spatial continuity typical of barrier-free design are not foreign to architectural discourse.

Unfortunately, the proximity between architectural discourse\u2019s focus on mobile experiences and the demands of disability activists distract from considering other relationships between architecture and the human body.

As environmental pollution and resource exhaustion have been considered as social issues, interest in green content industries which lead low-carbon green growth is increasing. In various areas, green content products and programs have been presented. Of them, kid theme parks are designed to recognize fun and advantages eco-friendly consumption with green contents has and lead children to recognize the problems of environmental pollution and the importance of environment. This study aims to analyse kid theme parks using green contents and characteristics of their space representation. The analysis frame was made through theoretical examination for bibliographical data and a direct interview in terms of factors of green contents. For the analysis frame, visitors were directly interviewed from June to July, 2012. Cases of introduction were analysed to identify realization and characteristics of green contents. As a result of the analysis, it was discovered that kid theme parks using green contents pursued green stories, but they did not consider environment seriously in terms of content materials and methods of realization. To develop successful kid theme parks using green contents, multi-dimensional research is needed in various aspects and various contents such as media should be introduced. The parks should provide fun space for children and propagate green ideas. Its success can lead in green entertainment.

These Author Design currents wielded no or at least a very different method and were very successful in the same period. The inspiration stemming from these developments has led to insights into an alternative design method: Creative Reflection. The growing recognition that ultimately led to the creation of this method runs like a red thread through the treatment of five design cases. These cases range from the design of the Coca Cola tray in 1996 ending with the design of a series of containers for spices commissioned by Verstegen. The period in between includes the design of a paint container for Akzo Nobel, a chair for Ahrend and a chair lift for Otolift.

This paper discusses interior design studio pedagogy at a private university in Indonesia, in which design methodologies in interior design studios have over the years employed the common sequential steps in design developed from architecture studios, interior design text books and professional experiences. While this linear programmatic approach has yielded logical products that could be applied to pragmatic spaces like residences and offices, they are insufficient in accommodating ambiguous and complex ideas essential in cultural spaces.

Inspired by ideas from a design project for second year Interior Design students at QUT School of Design, this toolkit explores, through five distinct exercises, different design tools and ways to approach the future design of environments (bathrooms) to facilitate the daily washing ritual, while addressing diverse and changing social, cultural, technological and environmental challenges. The Design Minds Refresh Toolkit particularly aims to promote \u2018Lateral Thinking\u2019 attitudes and empathy as an approach to create unusual and sustainable solutions to future problems that may affect our daily behavioural routines, and the spaces that facilitate them.

The toolkit encourages students and teachers to develop sketching, making, communication, presentation and collaboration skills to improve their design process, as well as explore further inquiry (background research) to enhance the ideation exercises. Exercise 1 focuses on the \u2018Inquire\u2019 and \u2018Ideate\u2019 phases, Exercise 2 and 3 build on ideation skills, and Exercise 4 and 5 concentrate on the \u2018Implement\u2019 phase.

Over the past 20 years technology has become embedded in almost every part of our lives, and nowhere more than in building design and construction. We are now witnessing the results of this technological shift in process within our built environment \u2013 some good, some not; as architects utilise and become more reliant on the computer. Thoughtfully created environments offer inhabitants comfort and security and a sense of wellbeing. The consideration and design of experience is an essential component of good architecture, get it right and the users\u2019 quality of life can be enhanced. Get it wrong and there is the potential for a poor and damaging experience for the inhabitant. Has this extensive use of the computer detached architects from the non visual experiences of their designs? Has this new technology moved us away from issues that we once deeply valued \u2013 regionality, skill and longevity and replaced them with homogeny, expediency and globalisation? Are we too eager and excited by the initial impact of these astonishing constructions facilitated by the technology at the expense of the end user and their experience when inhabiting these \u2018forms\u2019? \u2018Architecture has the capacity to be inspiring, engaging and life-enhancing.

The ambition of the year is to provide a platform where human experience within the spaces designed is valued equally alongside planning issues, construction and aesthetics, and aims to embed a social dimension to the process. One of the programme\u2019s intentions is to question the prioritisation of visual experience in the conception and making of buildings through investigations into the multi-sensory realms of architecture with the human at the centre. Through a series of connected briefs the students are challenged to design buildings and environments that have been holistically considered. Technology is embraced and supports hands on workshops and experiential recordings. Slow Architecture and its philosophies are considered alongside the pragmatics and the poetics of the proposals. With sustainability at the core, materiality, construction and how these contribute to an architecture where craft, sensuality, delight and contentment are also explored.

This study analyzed metaphorical characteristics of composite materials in terms of a visual aspect on a new material that is applicable for housing space. The results are as follows. First, the recent trend of housing space tends to stimulate emotions of residents through visual finishing materials, and for this reason, visual expression of a new material that is applicable to finishing materials plays an important role. Second, convertibleness, association and duplicity were selected as items of metaphorical expressions through the precedent studies. Third, most of combinations of materials were shown different from the existing materials in an expressive characteristic of composite materials through analysis, and application of a technology showed a different visual effect of patterns and textures from the existing materials. This implies that visual expression and directing are being attempted using such technology on finishing materials of housing space with development of digital technologies. Fourth, for metaphorical characteristics of composite material for housing space, combination of various materials and a digital technology were applied on convertibleness. For association, a combination of materials that have each different characteristic associated with the third material, and combination with subsidiary material of optical fiber and a digital technology were appled for duplicity.

Mirmoradi \u00b7 Effective Use of Nature in Educational Spaces Design \u00b7 pp 381-392 Introduction Technology development has been effective in the children\u2019s lifestyle, especially in the big cities. Children have been separated from the routine living in the nature as their presence in nature has been limited. Researchers at the University of Maryland discovered that between 1981 and 2003, in a typical week, children lost over nine hours of discretionary time, and computer use doubled. Studies released in 2005 and 2006 by the Kaiser Family Foundation, concluded that children between the ages of 8 and 18 \u201cspent an average of nearly 6.5 hours a day plugged in electronics\u201d (Louv,2005,p.119). One of the measurable impact of this for young children is that preschooler\u2019s \u201crisk for obesity increases by 6% for every hour of TV watched a day\u201d (Linn, 2008, p.49) though the \u201cchildhood link between outdoor activity and physical health is clear. Nowadays, the relationship between children and nature is being weakened and this problem should be improved by protecting the natural spaces at schools and the other public places which may be usable for children. Natural spaces at schools should provide three categories of children\u2019s needs which are denominated to: \u201ceducational\u201d, \u201ccommunal and physical\u201d, and childreneducational spacenaturearchitecturelandscape One of the most effective spaces on children\u2019s life is Educational spaces, where the children usually spend long period of their life there. According to various important aspects of outdoor and natural spaces in education and children\u2019s nurture skills, design of these spaces is an essential issue among the topics raised in designing educational spaces. Natural spaces at schools should provide three categories of children\u2019s needs, which are denominated to: \u201ceducational\u201d, \u201ccommunal and physical\u201d, and \u201cemotional\u201d needs. For all of these categories, the special spaces and desirable designing have to be concerned to achieve the most efficient educational spaces. Furthermore, outdoor designing and natural spaces will affect on artificial spaces of schools, due to the strong relationship between them. In current study, the effect of those three mentioned categories has been evaluated on the designing of educational spaces.

This paper reviewed child behavior in Chinese residential landscapes. A field survey was used to investigate place characteristics, whereas fixed-point observation and visualization records were utilized to analyze child behavior. Children were then classified into two categories, namely, those with action capacity and those with little capacity. Based on the classification and comparative analysis of place characteristics, along with the quantitative and visualized analysis of child behavior, the relationship between these two aspects was determined, and the effect of spatial elements in the selected residential areas on such a relationship was clarified. Additionally, the designing of a comprehensive landscape space that satisfies children's needs was also discussed. The conclusions are as follows: (1) Waterside is the element that most significantly affects child behavior. Children who can act on their own prefer to play along the waterside. (2) Open spaces attract children with action capacity, whereas children with little capacity tend to choose more private spaces. (3) Despite the presence of facilities for various activities, an extremely open space or one that is separated by a road still affects child behavior. (4) A comprehensive space with a water landscape, fitness facilities, high accessibility, and a number of cultural events may significantly affect child behavior. Both types of children were found to enjoy a place with such characteristics.

Although he had always been part of an active circle of artists and architects with whom he shared his radical ideas, Matta-Clark was generally excluded from the architectural milieu since his proposed interventions were thought to be unsuitable for accommodation. His exclusion from the architectural scene was marked; following his Window-Blow-Out(s) project in 1976, as Mary Jane Jacob has pointed out, his colleagues \u2013 including Peter Eisenman and the members of the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies (IAUS) \u2013 found it very hard to accept an architect with a BB gun in hand.

In 2010 there are 759 public libraries in Korea, and they have been increased constantly for the recent four to five years. In order to make them as cultural spaces in local communities, Korean government is now planning to increase the number of public libraries up to 900 and to build small to medium-sized multiple purpose libraries rather than large and single purpose ones. Especially in the case of public libraries in metropolitan cities, which are main libraries in those areas, they should be designed to play major functions of cultural experience, exhibition, and life-long education as well as to meet the basic needs of providing books for public reading and of building and developing branch libraries based on local characteristics. Above all, in order to make a public library as a center of local culture, a space planning focused on increasing utilization and satisfaction of the residents is required. It is essential to conduct a survey to understand the needs of the residential users and reflect their opinions. In this regard, our research process was constructed as follows.

A modular design methodology is proposed for achieving sustainable design as well as fulfilling functional requirements. Factors related to function and sustainability of a product, such as material, manufacturability, component life, and so on, are defined as modular drivers. A design structure matrix, with great advantages on analyzing the correlation between product system elements, is employed to establish a correlation matrix between components. A kernel-based fuzzy c-means algorithm is used to integrate components of a product into different modules based on their correlation distance. Meanwhile, a genetic algorithm is employed to determine the optimal clustering number on account of its efficiency in coming up with the global solutions. In addition, an assessment model for product sustainability is established considering economic, social, and environmental factors.

Purpose The personality impressions evoked by service environments play a key role in attracting and retaining customers. This paper explores the interior design of service and retail environments, and links the designer perspective with the consumer perspective to assist managers in creating and managing interiors for achieving desired responses. Design/methodology/approach The authors propose and test a conceptual model that relates types of interior design to consumer impressions of that environment's personality. Two studies establish holistic types of interiors based on design elements and factors with a sample of professionals, and then link those types to generic impressions evoked with consumers. Findings Store personality relates systematically to five holistic types of interiors. Minimal\u2010shell interiors score high on unpleasantness, complex\u2010shell designs score high on enthusiasm, genuineness, and solidity, moderate\u2010shell interiors generate below\u2010average impressions of sophistication, genuineness, and solidity, low\u2010content interiors score high on enthusiasm and sophistication, and high\u2010content designs score low on enthusiasm, and high on unpleasantness. Research limitations/implications This research is limited to wine tasting rooms as an example category. Implications for interior design in general can be drawn from the holistic types of interiors identified and from basic relations to generic dimensions of consumer responses. Practical implications The findings reported in this research assist managers in more confidently using interior design for positioning and differentiating servicescapes. Originality/value Integrating the designer perspective with the customer perspective is a unique approach yielding taxonomy for servicescape interiors, and a holistic perspective on their links with personality impressions.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1992047990"}}

Purpose The objectives of this paper are to present the development of an indicative multi\u2010phase systematic framework for performance appraisal of architectural design studio facilities, and to present the findings of the post\u2010occupancy conditions of an architectural design studio facility as a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the developed framework. Design/methodology/approach The authors carried out a number of activities. These include reviewing the published literature to address the significance of the architectural design studio as a resource for students majoring in architectural design, and ascertaining the significance of post\u2010occupancy evaluation as a performance appraisal methodology in educational facilities. On the development of the proposed framework, the authors carried out a case study in one of the studios of the Architecture Department at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The authors utilized a series of data collection methods, including photographic documentation, observations through walkthrough inspection, questionnaires and interviews. Findings The developed framework consists of four phases. It entails identifying the performance requirements of the architectural design studio; collecting data \u2013 through conducting walkthrough inspection, questionnaire survey and interviews \u2013 to ascertain the present performance level of the architectural design studio; analyzing the data gathered from the preceding steps and subsequent reporting of findings on the degree of user satisfaction with the architectural design studio space and facilities; and developing a plan of actions in the form of recommendations to improve the conditions of the evaluated design studio. The case study served as a validation of the developed performance appraisal framework. Originality/value The architectural design studio is known to be the place where students majoring in architectural design generate, review and display their design projects. Previous research on the performance appraisal of educational facilities indicates that the comfort of the architectural design studio space is a significant aspect to be considered and maintained for the success of the architectural education process. The paper provides a systematic approach for evaluating the major performance requirements of an architectural design studio.

This paper suggests a new theoretical lens to understand and manage construction design processes that draws on Heidegger's theory of deliberate action (Heidegger 1963). The lens interprets the day to day activities of designers as being immersed in practice without deliberate attention to everyday actions. Being immersed, designers do not reiterate the initial problem context and will only design for initially de_ned criteria. Only if the day to day ow of immersed practice is interrupted or is breaking down designers will involve in what Heidegger calls \"involved thematic deliberation\" or \"theoretical detached deliberation\" (Sandberg and Tsoukas 2011) that allows them to reiterate the initial problem context. This early position paper, introduces this new theoretical lens and shows its value by analyzing a number of design episodes that I observed during my ongoing ethnographic research work with designers. The examples show that the new lens allows for a good understanding of the increasing problems of designers to identify the wide range of societal and engineering issues during post-modern construction design e_orts upfront.

Background: There are varied and complex problems associated with the admission of students with disabilities into secondary (senior high) schools all over the world. This situation is further complicated by difficulties encountered in the built environment of these institutions and, in this, Ghana is no exception. Objectives: This exploratory study investigated the level of accessibility of the built environment in secondary schools in eight out of the ten regions of Ghana, in order to determine whether they conform to guidelines provided in international building standards and also assess the extent to which they have been designed and constructed to meet the provisions of the Persons with Disability Act 2006, which allows for equal access to public buildings in Ghana.Method: In total, 705 building elements in 264 facilities were surveyed using international standards, building codes, regulations and guidelines. These facilities included car parks, classrooms, dormitories, assembly halls, telephone booths and administration blocks.Results: Our findings revealed that most of the building elements were barring and not disability-friendly. Just to name a few: there were obstructions on access routes to and around buildings, absence of designated car parks, unfriendly vertical and horizontal means of circulation in buildings and lack of accessible sanitary accommodations. In addition, the general lighting and signage were poor. As a result, very few students with disabilities are admitted and retained in these schools.Conclusion: Mainstreaming of people with disabilities into the Ghanaian educational system remains impossible unless urgent action is taken to alter the facilities at secondary schools. Based on this research outcome, recommendations have been made to the Ghanaian government and the Ghana Education Service, as well as non-governmental organisations and relevant professional bodies for the amelioration of the present situation in our secondary schools.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1994421570"}}

ABSTRACT Designers and engineers are constantly searching for inspiration to solve their problems. One source of inspiration that has been used for centuries is nature. This practice is often referred to as \u2018biomimicry\u2019; innovation inspired by nature. This paper reviews existing literature and explores biomimicry information relevant for industrial design. Perceived benefits and pitfalls of using biomimicry in design are critically discussed. The paper stipulates that when used reductively \u2013 with the goal of finding a solution, not to necessarily create an ecologically sound product \u2013 biomimicry can be seen as a supplement to the designer's existing toolkit. However, it should not be used bombastically as if only nature can provide the panacea for all (sustainable) design challenges. Based on the review, a new biomimicry tool is presented in the form of a card deck, displaying categorized sources of inspiration towards design solutions.

ABSTRACT Research linking design to sustainability surfaced in the 1970s and has since received broad attention in academic and professional literature. Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring from 1962 and the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis from 1974 inspired design, among many other disciplines, to search for an appropriate balance between industrial cultures and natural surroundings. This article tracks a brief idea\u2010historical account of sustainable design theories. Main concepts in the field are consolidated under three criteria: ethics, technology fixes and social interaction. These criteria are considered as the main motivators for research and theory development in sustainable design. Following the Introduction, which gives an overview of concept development in design in general and sustainable design in particular, the second section explains the methodological onset for the analysis and introduces three concepts that represent important trends in sustainable design theory. The three concepts: Papanek's socially and ecologically responsible design, the Design for the Environment approach, and Manzini's sustainable everyday philosophy, are analysed in the third section according to the role they assign to the criteria. Further, the section reviews the concepts within a wider debate on sustainable development. The article concludes with a proposal as to how conceptualization in sustainable design could proceed, to meet the complexity of sustainability issues in present society.

This paper describes the characteristics of borderness dismantling of contemporary architecture and the design of underground space of university campus. Today, the contemporary society changes into that of fast fluctuation and multiplication due to the development and convergence of the various fields, and its institutional, conscious source and shape get diversified as well. And, as the extension and coexistence of them are realized, it is not regarded that the single value is absolute. The interdependence between different functions in kind gets more required as such phenomenon influences on the modern architecture and it appears as irregular and unhierarchical space going beyond the existing fixed relation. It performs the function as the integrated space not performing the fragmentation into mutually-subsumptive space that contains diversified society. The characteristics of borderness dismantling was grasped with the complexity, uncertainty, interaction, multicentric nature and continuity of modern architecture that appear due to such tendency and the characteristics of borderness dismantling was taken as the phased study that suggests it as the basic tool of future space plan of underground university campus by extracting the relation with the design of underground university campus and expressional characteristic through the cases based on the fact that the necessity of underground university campus is highlighted as the solution for insufficient space due to the increase of students and diversification of accepting space by the university administrations currently.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1857392346"}}

The purpose of this study is to develop a new church furniture design that can be harmonized with a new architecture of church in regard to new construction of S Church. In order to achieve the above purpose, a design work for church furniture was conducted in parallel with planning step of church construction according to collaborations among an architectural planner, church construction administrator team (of S Church) and a furniture designer. The development of a new church furniture design falls broadly into two steps, i.e. furniture design planning and life-size furniture production. First, the former step (furniture design planning) consisted of preparing a list of furniture goods required for S Church, performing a first-hand design work for liturgical furniture, and collecting or designing interior furniture goods in each room. Next, the latter step (life-size furniture production) consisted of selecting liturgical furniture producer and interior furniture producer, and completing a final design for church furniture by mock-up production and specification deliberation. Conclusively, it was found that this integrative design process for architecture consolidated with furniture contributed to creating a new type of church furniture design that can be harmonized with up-to-date and modern images of church architecture.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2227212443"}}

In To Forgive Design he surveys some of the most infamous failures of our time, from the 2007 Minneapolis bridge collapse and the toppling of a massive Shanghai apartment building in 2009 to Boston&rsquo;s prolonged Big Dig and the 2010 Gulf oil spill. These avoidable disasters reveal the interdependency of people and machines within systems whose complex behavior was undreamt of by their designers, until it was too late. Petroski shows that even the simplest technology is embedded in cultural and socioeconomic constraints, complications, and contradictions. Failure to imagine the possibility of failure is the most profound mistake engineers can make. Software developers realized this early on and looked outside their young field, to structural engineering, as they sought a historical perspective to help them identify their own potential mistakes. By explaining the interconnectedness of technology and culture and the dangers that can emerge from complexity, Petroski demonstrates that we would all do well to follow their lead.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4255104062"}}

This PhD thesis reports on car fluff management, recycling and recovery. Car fluff is the residual waste produced by car recycling operations, particularly from hulk shredding. Car fluff is known also as Automotive Shredder Residue (ASR) and it is made of plastics, rubbers, textiles, metals and other materials, and it is very heterogeneous both in its composition and in its particle size. In fact, fines may amount to about 50%, making difficult to sort out recyclable materials or exploit ASR heat value by energy recovery.  This 3 years long study started with the definition of the Italian End-of-Life Vehicles (ELVs) recycling state of the art. A national recycling trial revealed Italian recycling rate to be around 81% in 2008, while European Community recycling target are set to 85% by 2015. Consequently, according to Industrial Ecology framework, a life cycle assessment (LCA) has been conducted revealing that sorting and recycling polymers and metals contained in car fluff, followed by recovering residual energy, is the route which has the best environmental perspective.  This results led the second year investigation that involved pyrolysis trials on pretreated ASR fractions aimed at investigating which processes could be suitable for an industrial scale ASR treatment plant. Sieving followed by floatation reported good result in thermochemical conversion of polymers with polyolefins giving excellent conversion rate. This factor triggered ecodesign considerations. Ecodesign, together with LCA, is one of the Industrial Ecology pillars and it consists of design for recycling and design for disassembly, both aimed at the improvement of car components dismantling speed and the substitution of non recyclable material. Finally, during the last year, innovative plants and technologies for metals recovery from car fluff have been visited and tested worldwide in order to design a new car fluff treatment plant aimed at ASR energy and material recovery.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W629269392"}}

While design research has concentrated on creativity in the early phases of design and on creativity in very open-ended design tasks, in practice many design projects concern the modification or incremental development of existing systems to meet new needs and restrictions. Some projects adopt a process of defining, prioritising and propagating requirements and constraints that bypasses conceptual design as it is conventionally understood. However, incremental development requires creative design to deal with multiple conflicting requirements, both in early design and in solving later local problems: the challenge lies in finding a satisfactory solution while avoiding a cascade of changes to the rest of the system. This paper draws on two case studies, one of the design of a new generation of diesel engines and one of the refurbishment of a hospital ward, to argue that in these domains creativity is required to find designs that change as little as possible and meet the given requirements with minimal effort.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2028793707"}}

Product design stages are important to consider critically in production. Generally, product design that shall be created by designer, should consider what the customer wants and needs. Nowadays issues, product design does not only consider the \u201cwants and needs\u201d of user, but also how the design can be created by embedding sustainability aspects in the product. Culture is also one of the important aspects which need to be considered in product design as culture affects the way users respond to the product. This paper aims to develop a new model for design development, in which the aspects of culture are incorporated into sustainable product design. By reviewing the existing literature, the authors attempt to identify the gaps of the existing papers, which illustrate how culture affects sustainable product design. Recent papers have only shown that culture influences product design, but they do not explore sustainability and the culture aspects in product design. Due to these gaps, it is therefore important to create a model which will assist designers to elicit sustainable product design based on cultural aspects. In summary, designers need to reflect on the \u201cwants and needs\u201d of users.

In this study, Life Cycle Assessment is applied to estimate potential implications of waste composition evolution in end-of-life treatments. The aim is to understand the environmental effects of treating Automotive Shredder Residue (ASR), which is the residual waste after shredding End-of-Life Vehicles (ELVs), when its composition will change as it is expected to happen in the coming years. Thus, for modeling it, two features have been mainly considered: (i) an increase in light material content such as polymers and nonferrous metals (especially aluminum) in new vehicle production, and (ii) an improved polymer separation and recycling by reducing the different kinds of plastics used in cars, according to an ecodesign-oriented strategy. Landfill, incineration, mechanical recycling, and chemical recycling scenarios have been considered as possible waste treatments for LCA analysis, and the expectations regarding the potential benefits from the recycling of aluminum and polyolefins from ELVs, for the Italian situation, have been discussed. Results confirm that innovative but still small-scale recycling plants, modeling mechanical and chemical recycling options, achieve the lowest impacts today due to the combination of material and energy recovery, with a consequent decrease in the residual amount of waste disposed of in landfill. As seen in these estimates, in terms of impact reducing benefits related to nonrenewable energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, ASR waste may represent an important input for secondary material production in the coming years. Also, a sustainable design of future vehicles, characterized by a reduction in the number of different materials employed and a growth of nonferrous metal use, will lead to greater economic and technical advantages for the mechanical separation activities followed by recycling processes. Lastly, the outcomes point to the need to consider both a LCA and ecodesign approaches for decision makers in waste management strategies, in order to properly handle factors which may affect future development or help organize a suitable exploitation of different treatment practices.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2117429766"}}

Old buildings are being recycled into libraries all over the world. The process of rededication of a building with a former different usage into a library is quite obviously a matter of recycling. The transformation of an existing building with a prior non-library function into a library brings the challenge and the opportunity for sustainable thinking in library planning. As non-renewable resources are decreasing, reusing and recycling are going to become increasingly necessary in the future. The recycling of old buildings means reducing the ecological footprint of library buildings in a cost-effective and efficient way. Beside \u2018green\u2019 aspects like water conservation, energy conservation, recycled or sustainable building materials, indoor air quality, and solar power from photo-voltaic panels, the planning of an adaptive reuse is a very different task than the planning of a library in a totally new building.

Since the architectural design studio learning environment was first established in the early 19th century at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, there has been a complete transformation in how the discipline of architecture is practiced and how students of architecture acquire information. Digital technologies allow students to access information instantly and learning is no longer confined to the rigid boundaries of a physical campus environment. In many schools of architecture in Australia, the physical design studio learning environments however, remain largely unchanged. Many learning environments could be mistaken for those last refurbished 30 years ago, being devoid of any significant technological intervention. While some teaching staff are eagerly embracing new digital technologies and attempting to modify their pedagogical approaches, the physical design studio learning environment is resistant to such efforts. In a study aimed at better understanding how staff and students adapt to new blended learning environments, a group of 165 second year architecture students at a large school of architecture in Australia were separated into two different design studio learning environments. 70% of students were allocated to a traditional design studio setting and 30% to a new, high technology embedded, prototype digital learning laboratory. The digital learning laboratory was purpose designed for the case-study users, adapted Student-Centred Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs [SCALE-UP] principles, and built as part of a larger university research project. The architecture students attended the same lectures, followed the same studio curriculum and completed the same pieces of assessment; the only major differences were the teaching staff and physical environment within which the studios were conducted. At the end of the semester, all staff and students were asked to complete a questionnaire about their experiences and preferences within the two respective learning environments. The questionnaire response rate represented the opinions of 100% of the 10 teaching staff and over 70% of the students. Using a qualitative grounded theory approach, data were coded, extrapolated and compared, to reveal emerging key themes. The key themes formed the basis for in-depth interviews and focus groups of teaching staff and students, allowing the researchers to understand the data in more detail. The results of the data verified what had become increasingly evident during the course of the semester: an underlying negative resistance to the new digital studio learning environment, by both staff and students. Many participants openly exhibited a yearning for a return to the traditional design studio learning environments, particularly when the new technology caused frustration, by being unreliable or failing altogether. This paper reports on the study, discusses the negative resistance and explores the major contributors to resistance. The researchers are not aware of any similar previous studies across these particular settings and believe that it offers a necessary and important contribution to emergent research about adaptation to new digital learning environments.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W17150109"}}

Industry is recognized as one of the main sources of environmental pollution and  resource depletion, both causing environmental degradation; nonetheless, its  contribution to development and wealth creation is also acknowledged.  Therefore, the identification of sustainable options in this area is a key factor.  Nowadays, the attitude towards pollution prevention and control and cleaner  production is not just a response to emerging environmental laws and regulations  (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals -REACH-,  Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control \u2013IPPC- Law, Integrated Product Policy  \u2013IPP-), but also a matter of corporate responsibility. Further, it has proved to be a  way to increase profits. The sustainability definition has received certain criticism  for its vagueness, ambiguity and difficulty to translate this concept at different  levels. To overcome the difficulties of its implementation, a wide variety of  indicators have been developed and applied over the years, providing metrics  essential at the action level.  This thesis poses a contribution to the development of environmental evaluation  tools adapted to particular production sectors, aiming at providing metrics to  guide decision making for the ecodesign of sustainable processes and products.  Integrative frameworks that combine methodologies of different nature were  proposed as the most suitable way to achieve comprehensive evaluations. At the  same time, the simplicity of tools was pursued to make its application easier and  more attractive for enterprises, avoiding the need of in depth training.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1864318564"}}

The purpose of this study is to understand the usage time-zone of campus environment, to define the correlation between campus differentiation and loyalty of university, and to examine symbolic elements of outdoor space in campus environment. For the research method, questionnaires were carried out targeting college students in 4 Universities located at Seoul. The results of this study as follows: First, the college students spend less than 2 hours in outdoor campus mostly during morning or lunch time. Second, the three factors of the environmental differentiation, 'outdoor environment', 'indoor classroom', and 'support facilities', were all highly correlated which, after all, influence the overall differentiation as well as the university loyalty. Third, it was found that symbolic elements such as \u2018UI(University Identity)\u2019, 'symbol tower', 'the main building', and 'library' express the university identity.

Over the years a wide range of techniques have been developed to evaluate the environmental performance of products. However, they all consider the environmental aspect of a product in an isolated way, without taking into account the remaining requirements that a designer has to consider during the design process. Hence, the integration of environmental aspects into the early stages of the design process together with a multi-criteria approach that makes it possible to balance the environmental requirements against other traditional requirements are two of the key factors for successful sustainable design. This article reviews and classifies tools that have been developed to evaluate the environmental requirement of products and to facilitate its integration into the product design process. With the intention of providing designers with a brief guide to selecting the ecodesign tool that best fits a specific case study, a classification was made according to criteria such as: 1) the method applied for the environmental assessment, 2) the product requirements that need to be integrated in addition to the environmental one (multi-criteria approach), 3) whether the tool has a life cycle perspective (i.e. it considers all the stages of the life cycle of a product), 4) the nature of the results (qualitative or quantitative), 5) the stages of the conceptual design process where the tool can be applied, and 6) the methodology taken as a basis for such integration.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2013452988"}}

Abstract The challenge of realigning the present path of development on a sustainable trajectory concerns all sectors of society, including engineering. To move towards a sustainable practice of engineering, the design process needs to be modified in order for engineers to efficiently tackle the related issues. Such \u2018sustainable design processes\u2019 (SDPs) are proposed in the literature. By reviewing the conventional design process and SDP, this paper aims to identify the differences between both approaches. The potential contribution of recent design theories, methods and techniques to sustainable engineering is also briefly discussed. Tasks from existing SDPs are combined with crucial complements into a novel integrated sustainable engineering design process. Instead of representing conventional and sustainable engineering as a dichotomy, this paper places both paradigms on a continuum along which the engineer can position himself and assess his progress. The proposed procedure reveals shades of sustainability along six dimensions: (1) the structure of the design process, (2) the scope of sustainability issues covered, (3) the relevance of the indicators considered, (4) the accuracy of the tools used for evaluation, (5) the potential improvements expected from the alternatives assessed and (6) decision-making.

Although environmental characteristics as perceived by parents are known to be related to children\u2019s outdoor play behavior, less is known about the relation between independently measured neighborhood characteristics and outdoor play among children. The purpose of this study was to identify quantitative as well as qualitative neighborhood characteristics related to outdoor play by means of neighborhood observations. Questionnaires including questions on outdoor play behavior of the child were distributed among 3,651 parents of primary school children (aged 4\u201312 years). Furthermore, neighborhood observations were conducted in 33 Dutch neighborhoods to map neighborhood characteristics such as buildings, formal outdoor play facilities, public space, street pattern, traffic safety, social neighborhood characteristics, and general impression. Data of the questionnaires and the neighborhood observations were coupled via postal code of the respondents. Multilevel GEE analyses were performed to quantify the correlation between outdoor play and independently measured neighborhood characteristics. Parental education was negatively associated with outdoor play among children. Neither the presence nor the overall quality of formal outdoor play facilities were (positively) related to outdoor play among children in this study. Rather, informal play areas such as the presence of sidewalks were related to children\u2019s outdoor play. Also, traffic safety was an important characteristic associated with outdoor play. This study showed that, apart from individual factors such as parental education level, certain modifiable characteristics in the neighborhood environment (as measured by neighborhood observations) were associated with outdoor play among boys and girls of different age groups in The Netherlands.

Many urban environments are being redesigned around a relatively new approach to street design termed shared space. Shared space is a traffic engineering concept that eliminates physical barriers separating motor vehicles, pedestrians, and other road users to encourage a sharing of street space. Such sharing is seen as a means to calm traffic and to create convivial urban spaces. The evidence shows that local authorities in the UK and overseas are enthusiastic about shared space for its potential to enhance the urban realm. Vulnerable street users, such as vision-impaired people, do not share this enthusiasm. They perceive shared space as likely to bring them into increasing contact with motor vehicles, and as compromising their safety and well-being. Shared spaces are, potentially, what I refer to as auto-disabling environments. Referring to data from the UK, I develop the proposition that shared space can be characterised as \u2018disembodied urban design\u2019 that fails to capture the complexity of corporeal form and the manifold interactions of bodies-in-space. The disembodied understanding of the interactions between bodies, space, and movement, propagated by shared space design, (re)produces both existential insecurity and ontological uncertainty amongst certain categories of users, such as vision-impaired people. Shared space can be understood as a manifestation of disabling design in the built environment, and as a reaffirmation of disabled people's relative invisibility in relation to the crafting of designed spaces.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2094072651"}}

But the will to establish an equilibrated connection among used resources in human activities, supported by the sustainability perspective, evidences that the contribution of ergonomics/human factors can be effectively enlarged to other aspects, especially in relation to building design. In fact a sustainable building is meant to be a building that contributes, through its characteristics and attribute, to a sustainable development by assuring, in the same time, a decrease of resources use and environmental impact and an increase of health, safety and comfort of the occupants. The purpose of this paper is to analyze in a broader sense the contribution of ergonomic/human factor to design of sustainable building, focusing how ergonomics principles, methodology and techniques can improve building design, enhancing its sustainability performance during all phases of building lifecycle.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W327848983"}}

Low-floor buses represent a significant improvement in accessible public transit for passengers with limited mobility. However, there is still a need for research on the inclusive design of transit buses to identify specific low-floor bus design conditions that are either particularly accommodating or challenging for passengers with functional and mobility impairments. These include doorway locations, seating configuration and the large front wheel-well covers that collectively impact boarding, alighting and interior movement of passengers. Findings from a laboratory study using a static full-scale simulation of a lowfloor bus to evaluate the impact of seating configuration and crowding on interior movement and accessibility for individuals with and without walking aids are presented (n=41). Simulated bus journeys that included boarding, fare payment, seating, and alighting were performed. Results from video observations and subjective assessments showed differences in boarding and alighting performance and users' perceptions of task difficulty. The need for assistive design features (e.g. handholds, stanchions), legroom and stowage space for walking aids was evident. These results demonstrate that specific design conditions in low-floor buses can significantly impact design preference among those who use walking aids.

Life Cycle Thinking is an important tool for doing this, but it was not developed with materials in mind and it focuses only on that small part of sustainability related to environmental impacts. Economic and societal issues require other methodologies and all these complementary visions have to be aggregated in order to report properly on sustainability matters. To advance towards such a new tool, called the New Metrics, an Initiative called SOVAMAT was launched 10 years ago and a Community has shaped up, binging together academics from a broad array of hard and soft disciplines, materials producers from metals to plastics, glass, paper/cardboard, concrete, carbons, wood, etc., and materials users, including meta-users who work on ecodesign, for example.

As has happened in many other countries, Brazil has also witnessed an evident change in the question of accessibility over the last twenty years. In line with this theme, that of old age has only become evident in the last two decades. For a long period of time, the elderly have been systematically ignored as an object of investigation and have not been contemplated with consistent public social policies. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to verify the conditions of physical accessibility that allow the elderly to use public spaces, taking as a study case the S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo square and the Sol\u00f3n de Lucena Park, in the city of Jo\u00e3o Pessoa--PB, identifying the biological and functional losses suffered by elderly people due to the aging process and verifying the specific physical needs of this segment of the population. Qualitative methods were adopted, such as systematic observations with the production of behaviour maps, in addition to a review of the literature and analysis of the data. The research identified problems related to the physical accessibility of the elderly to public spaces that generate difficulties for displacement, use, information and orientation, contributing to the planning and ergonomic guidelines which aim at improving these environments, such as the use of different and contrasting colours on the urban furniture and floor, for example.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1555987490"}}

Finding relations between configuration and activity of the level found in cities in strongly programmed buildings have challenged research for a long time. With increasing clarity, it has shown to have to do with how and where activity takes place. Compared to cities and large public complexes, workplaces are more centred around specific locations and the activities in them, whereas streets are more defined by movement between spaces exterior to the street system (i.e. between interior spaces). One reason for this difference is the time spent moving versus the time spent on specific locations, but also the way in which certain ranges of movement and activity is more programmed within workplaces than in cities. Most of this is well known within the field. What this paper adds to the discussion is a study of different spatializations of workflow of different roles and for different tasks. The paper does this through the concept of spatial practice, which is considered as the interplay between spatial configuration, organizational configuration, and the configuration of work processes and routines. In this way some conditions of workplace programs are brought to the forefront, and workplace distribution and organisation routines are discussed through direct and indirect benefits of different practices, as well as internal and external conditions of programs or tasks.

Although technological innovation has brought many benefits into architecture and planning, it is still difficult to embed inclusive design into real-world applications. Reviewing the literature on inclusion in the architectural design context indicates that an in-depth understanding to the diverse user of matching marketing purposes is lacking. Consequently, defining the user in the built environment as an \u2018average person\u2019 creates user-unfriendly public spaces. \u201cDesign exclusion does not come about by chance: it comes about through neglect, ignorance and a lack of adequate data and information\u201d (Cassim et al., 2007).

Also different interpretations of the Directive by member states and the large variety of products to be considered have added to the necessity of a recast. The present situation in this respect is analysed in three study reports commissioned by the European Commission; a summary of their recommendations and policy options is given in this chapter. In its present proposals for the recast of WEEE, the European Commission has only partly followed up on these. Amendments in the first reading by the European Parliament will bring several enhancements but simultaneously often do not bring more eco-efficiency. At the time of writing, it remains to be seen what the final outcome will be.

This study looks at potential contributions of the Ecodesign Directive 2009/125/EC to eco-innovations addressing resource efficiency improvements of energy-related products. This aim is secondary to the prime objective of the Directive, the increase in energy efficiency of energy-related products. By conducting ten in-depth interviews, the study investigates whether and in what form the Directive, which is to address 31 product groups, can contribute to innovations, potentially with resource efficiency improvements, referred to as eco-innovations. The analysis reveals the success of the Directive in cutting off the worst performing products from the market, highlights the Energy label as a stronger driver for innovation and discusses the current limitations of the Directive regarding the implementation of resource efficiency objectives. Recognizing that many issues are product-specific, the study is narrowed down to focus on electric motors, which account for high energy consumption in industry and demonstrate significant ecodesign improvement potential. The extension of the Directive electric motor group to possibly comprise permanent magnet motors is related to whether it could foster innovations capable of achieving resource efficiency improvements of rare earth elements. These materials, classified as critical in the EU, are able to achieve high energy densities in permanent magnets and can contribute to developing motors with higher energy efficiency classes. The case study uses a selection of innovation drivers integrated in Geels\u2019 (2002) multi-level perspective for technological transitions to evaluate their influence on permanent magnet motor developments.

Accessibility of the built environment (buildings and spaces) is pivotal to participation by people with disability (PWD) and in particular people with mobility limitation (PWML) using a wheelchair or crutches for ambulation. Barriers due to inaccessibility of the built environment limit participation by PWML in education, vocational training, employment, health services, business, sport and recreation, religious activities, civic, political, socio-economic and personal relationships. In developed countries efforts have advanced in making the built environment accessible for all. In developing countries such as Zambia inaccessibility of the built environment remains unaddressed. This research aimed to examine the accessibility of the built environment and explore the impact on participation by PWML in Zambia. The ultimate goal was to generate evidence that might be used to develop strategies and to determine design elements for accessibility which could inform legislation and standards for adoption in Zambia. Five main objectives to achieve this goal formed the five studies which overarch this research. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) was used to develop a structured approach to understanding how inaccessibility of the environment impacted on participation in a chosen lifestyle by PWML in Zambia.Study 1 aimed to explore the accessibility situation in a developing country such as Zambia. The perspective is that PWML in developing countries, more specifically Zambia, appear not to experience the same rights as their counterparts in developed countries. It comprised a review of the current literature by examining the impact of inaccessibility on participation. Disability right to access has been addressed in developed countries such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa but there has been limited policy development in most developing countries such as Zambia resulting in low participation for people with disabilities. Study 2 aimed to investigate the perspective of PWML (PWML) firstly of accessibility of public buildings and spaces and secondly of how their capacity to participate in a preferred life style has been affected. The impact of inaccessibility was explored through focus groups comprised from a purposive sampling of PWML representing all Zambians. The outcome from this work identified public buildings perceived to be important for participation in daily life. Government buildings, schools, and higher learning institutions, businesses and service providers, religious buildings, recreational and health were identified as inaccessible thereby denying autonomy in outdoor mobility and limiting participation in a chosen lifestyle. Participants in the focus groups were also asked to suggest how accessibility might be improved in Zambia. This data was reported with the results of study 6. Study 3 aimed to explore the perceived participation in preferred life areas and determine the relationship between accessibility of public buildings and spaces and participation problems experienced. Utilising the Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire (IPAQ), seventy-five people with mobility limitations, participation experiences and autonomy outdoor mobility, work and education, and problem experiences were evaluated. Eighty to ninety-one percent (80.0% - 91.0%) participants had poor to very poor chances of participating in the three participation domains (mobility, work and education) with most participants experienced minor to severe problems with significant negative impact in their chosen life style. Study 4 aimed to develop a tool that might be used to evaluate the built environment in Zambia. The Participation-Based Environment Accessibility Assessment Tool (P-BEAAT) was developed using the data gained from the focus groups in study 2. It incorporated 8 environmental features (sections) and 66 items which described the potential barriers to participation for PWML using wheelchairs or crutches for mobility. The tool was validated (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 .91) for content through the consumer and expert opinion. Study 5 aimed to demonstrate the reliability of the P-BEAAT when applied by trained and untrained users. The test-re-test reliability was determined by six raters who used the P-BEAAT to assessed 20 public buildings on two occasions two weeks apart. The multiple rater Kappa statistic was used to determine inter-rater reliability (.89 and 95% agreement) and intra-rater reliability (.78-.89) reliability and agreement using correlation coefficient of .79-.82. Thus the P-BEAAT was shown to be reliable and so suitable for utilisation by trained professionals and non-professional users. Study 6 aimed to demonstrate the accessibility status of the built environment in Zambia. One hundred and two buildings and their surrounds were assessed in five of the nine provinces of Zambia. The results showed that 46.1-87.5% of government and educational institutions were inaccessible. The barriers to access identified included (in descending order) parking spaces, accessible toilet, ramp and rails, accessible transport services, lifts/elevators and building entrances and pathways. Buildings built after 2000 were slightly more accessible than those built earlier but generally the only areas with good access were circulating areas in the building. The suggestions for improving access obtained from the focus groups in study 2 included the importance of being recognised as having equal rights to access and so included into society, need for supportive legislation that recognised these rights through a political system that enabled a national disability strategy developed in consultation with PWD and other stakeholders, access standards and supportive legislation. In addition, rehabilitation strategies should include activity and participation outcome measures aimed at reducing the impact of impairments and assess the individual\u2019s performance across a range of areas \u2013 including communication, mobility, self-care, education, work and employment, and quality of life. The purposive sampling of the composition of the participants of the focus groups all of whom had mobility limitation and the public buildings that were identified by the PWML as important for their participation in public life was a strength of this work. The barrier imposed by poor recognition of PWML as potentially productive members of the community was identified during the component studies. Recommendations for addressing this problem when combined with improvement of the built environment suggested by the results from the P-BEAAT application study and utilising solutions to inaccessibility practiced in developed countries are made. The suggested approach should enable PWML in Zambia more equity in lifestyle participation.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W117055439"}}

The Space Syntax concept of the generative and conservative building describes the effect of spatial configuration on knowledge creation: a building that acts generatively allows new relationships, new ideas, new products and new knowledge to emerge by maximising random encounters between people. In contrast, a building that acts conservatively preserves and mirrors existing relationships, existing ideas and existing knowledge by reinforcing a specific interface between people. A key criterion for the generativity of a building was proposed to be an integrative layout. However, evidence of patterns of encounter, movement flows and organisational behaviour suggests that not every building with high levels of integration is automatically generative of new knowledge. What is more, looking at a spatial layout it is difficult to judge whether the level of integration is rather high or low given size and structure of the space (e.g. number of floors, size of floor plate). Therefore the question of what constitutes a generative office building remains unanswered. Using a large sample of 62 different organisations and their office spaces, this paper therefore aims to create a better understanding of what renders an office building generative or conservative, by expanding on the original theory of generativity and including a more detailed articulation of the spatial qualities that are influential. For the analysis, results of a VGA of each of the office buildings in the sample are compared, investigating not only overall levels of integration, but also the distribution of integration and the relationship between integration levels and structural features. This allows the construction of a benchmark of possible ranges of integration for office buildings. It is further investigated which of the buildings are deemed generative by the inhabitants and how this relates to various spatial characteristics. The paper finally proposes a variety of different factors that may have a bearing on the generativity of an office building. This list of factors combines suggestions from the original theory of generative and conservative buildings with additional syntactical, spatial and organisational aspects of space usage. The paper concludes that the generativity of an office space depends on several factors and features, including but not limited to integration and syntactical measures that can be analysed on the basis of a floor plan. Implications for theory and workplace consultancy practice are discussed and reflected on.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W11731631"}}

Despite the actual environmental, economic and social crisis calls humanity for radical changes to ensure the survival of the mankind, there are new prospects that encourage to rethink the entire socio-productive system in a sustainable manner. Therefore the main criteria for the development of eco-efficient products deal with the reduction of inputs such as material consumption and energy, the reduction of toxic and/or harmful resources, the use of biocompatible and local renewable resources, the product life optimisation by means of easy updating and maintenance procedures, a reduced semantic and functional obsolescence, the life extension of materials and the strengthening of the use phase of products. Despite the eco-friendly products and services, use far less energy and materials than those of some decades ago, the overall consumption of environmental resources continues to increase. This tells us clearly that even if the existent improvements are increasing, they are not enough: the translation towards sustainability requires a systemic change. It is not a question of doing what we already do better, but of doing different things in innovative and different ways going beyond the mere eco-efficiency. We need to regain the cultural knowledge and experience that allows us to define and design production flows that can traverse different systems in a continuous process that decreases the ecological footprint of products while increasing income throughout the economy.

This thesis explores the conditions under which traditional Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) can be involved in the design of sustainable Product Service Systems (PSS). The integration between design and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the context of sustainable business development was used to define the space for this exploration. The research was carried out through a case study with a group of Colombian Manufacturing SMEs. As a result of the case study a business framework was developed to guide the design of sustainable PSS.  In order to establish the basis of the research a review of the literature on sustainable business development, ICT, design, product service systems and SMEs was carried out. This review brought to light the main features of a sustainable PSS and the challenges associated with its design. These challenges were further investigated in the context of SMEs with a scoping study involving a group of 38 Colombian SMEs. Additionally, 36 PSS already on the market were analysed to identify the possible relationships between design and ICT, and to determine how they could contribute to develop sustainable PSS. The scoping study and the analysis of the 36 PSS gave structure to the case study with a second group of Colombian Manufacturing SMEs. This case study aimed to build understanding of the connection between the characteristics of these SMEs and the main features of a sustainable PSS. As a result of this case study a set of concepts, drivers and barriers to take into account to design sustainable PSS formed the basis of a business framework developed and validated in the final part of the research.  The business framework proposed can help to understand the resources and changes needed to develop a sustainable PSS, reducing the uncertainty that it may cause. The integration between product and service design and ICT is used in the framework to outline the areas of opportunity in the design of sustainable PSS. This business framework developed as a result of the research promises to be a helpful tool for organisations working to support the transformation of SMEs toward competitive and sustainable business models using as a basis the integration between product and service design and ICT.

CASE STUDY : SANAA", "abstract": "Concretion, abstraction : the place of design processes in today architecture practice. CASE STUDY : SANAA. Observing contemporary architecture, as a practitioner and teacher, we become aware of the difficulty to understand the constitutive rules of a project and even when one can identify some, they are often limited in reach. The qualifiers for the word architecture have multiplied over time: minimalism, hygienism, socio-participationism, formalism, high-tech, low-tech, sustainable and eco are some examples. After one century of avant-gardes, architectural practice has been scattered in uncountable styles and streams. This has lead to a free market situation in which architects and teachers are confronted by an almost endless catalogue of approaches and styles: between multiple-choice and pragmatist refusal, this context provokes an issue with arbitrariness and relevance. Today the design processes are fundamental for the understanding of architectural projects, since universal rules of composition (harmony) and common ideals (beauty) have failed to support them exhaustively. A possible stable common ground to all constructed projects remains in the act of construction. Where architects like Peter Zumthor or Herzog & de Meuron search a new way to use and interpret the materials and their use in our globalised world, SANAA work seems to remove materiality from architecture. This absence creates a kind of timeless spatiality which is not necessarily open or closed. However, this approach is not a negation of matter (in the sense of Semper), as making matter disappear implies a very strong commitment to materiality and very sophisticated technological solutions. This paper bears relevance for both practitioners and teachers at two levels: it explores the theoretical relevance and the practical tools of an outstanding referential architect. It explores, with the specific tools of the architect, the design process of their projects through the question of the construction. The analysis is based on both their writings and the realized projects.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W1675518296"}}

Most early writings on design research are built on rationalistic assumptions. Design became an exercise in mathematics, and the task of design research was to describe the natural and human rationalities that govern it. Rationalistic assumptions were particularly strong in the 1950s and 1960s. At that time, the studio model of the Bauhaus became too limited to respond to the demands of increasingly complex and growing industries. However, rationalistic methods failed to get much of a following in design, probably because they barely tackled the human and artistic faces of design. After the demise of the design methods movement, designers turned to the behavioral and social sciences in their search to find new beginnings. In several places, user-centered design gained a foothold. This step was not radical, given designers' self image. Designers have long seen themselves as speakers for people in the industry. As definition shows, designers see themselves as proponents of people in the industry. This self-image has more than a grain of truth, especially when designers are compared to engineers. This self image has deep historical roots. The importance of studying people was first forcefully introduced to design in postwar America. However, it was in the 1990s that industrial design and the emerging interaction design went through the so-called user-centered turn. The key idea was that everyone has expertise of some kind and, hence, can inspire design.

The street is a vital part of the public space in urban areas that cater for users\u2019 functional, social and leisure needs. Currently, in Malaysia there has been a growing concern towards promoting streets that are friendly to all users. This is because there are not many examples of street environments that are friendly and accommodating to the users. Based on previous research, people are more ready to walk than today in the case of improved public spaces. In order to ensure the successful design of urban street, the understanding of street\u2019s characteristics and qualities and users\u2019 activities on the street are important. The research examines the concept of \u2018user-friendly street\u2019 in the context of Malaysian town centre. The primary concern of the research is to study the needs of the users that contribute to the use of streets and their livability in the urban areas of Malaysia. There are two complementary research methods used in this research, namely field study and survey. A single case study was applied in this study. The case study chosen is one of the main shopping streets in Kuala Lumpur and is selected based on the physical, functional and socio cultural characteristics of the street. The inventory of the case study is based on field observations of activities using schedule checklists, photographs and maps procedures. In this research, users\u2019 perceptions element was obtained through a sample survey of daily users, occasional users and non-users. The research has found that there are variations in the users\u2019 perception towards the factors and attributes that contribute to user-friendly street between different types of users and socio backgrounds. The streets were not only used by the users based on physical and functional qualities but also based on the meaning. It is expected that the findings will improve our understanding of what we consider to be the public realm in terms of the physical characteristics and qualities that support the user\u2019s friendly built environments. This will help the designers, urban planners and policy makers to understand the needs and attitudes of users towards the concept of a user-friendly street in Malaysia.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W3183111416"}}

Based on current trends in both professions, we anticipate a future that sees architectural and structural engineering responsibilities no longer strictly separated but collaboratively integrated, in a way that harnesses benefits of specialist expertise, yet\u2013somewhat reminiscent of the role of the medieval master builder\u2013recognizes the need for generalist awareness and oversight required to achieve architectural and structural innovation. From this position, we propose a learning approach for architectural students that focuses less on rote learning and calculation and emphasizes applied learning through model building and the development of \"structural commonsense\" through the detailed study of precedent case studies.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W4232046466"}}

During the course of the 1960s, computers and information networks made their appearance in the public imagination. To architects on the cusp of architecture's postmodern turn, information technology offered new forms, metaphors, and techniques by which modern architecture's technological and utopian basis could be reasserted. Yet by the end of the 1970s, when computers and networks fully appeared in the workplace, schools, and even homes, architects had all but abandoned information technology as a source of architectural ideas, relegating computers to a supporting role in architectural practice where they performed only the most mundane of tasks, one from which they would emerge only two decades later.This dissertation argues that architecture in the 1970s did not in fact retreat from information technology but rather that the changing nature of information technology demanded new modes of architectural thinking that destabilized the traditional discursive function of the machine underpinning modern architecture. It examines various ways in which information technology influenced architectural thinking during this troubled period of transition through the historical treatment of a single case study, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (or Beaubourg, as it was and is still known). It considers on the building's role in a more general program of social and cultural reorganization in the information society, from the original conception of the building as an enormous information processing machine to the reception of Piano and Rogers' building in the years following its completion. In chapters examining the informational ideas in the competition brief, the architectural responses to the competition, the sources for the winning scheme by Piano and Rogers and its relationship to technological utopianism in British architecture, the development of the final building and its challenge to the megastructure paradigm, and the privileging of the user in new techniques of architectural programming first deployed in a cultural building at Beaubourg, this dissertation tries to identify a broad spectrum of modes of engagement between architecture and information technology beyond the tool-based approaches prevalent today.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W140458620"}}

In real life the developers can only make ambiguous estimates on the available resources and their aspirations bringing uncertainty (fuzziness) in the problem formulation. In such situations, crisp optimization technique may not serve the purpose to quantify desired parameters. In this paper we have formulated a fuzzy optimization framework which supports build or buy decision strategy i.e., whether to buy software components or to build them in-house or a combination is more beneficial. In this paper, intra-modular coupling density and reliability are jointly optimized under permissible budget and delivery time constraints along with an ICD restriction applied at module level.

Then, a new building, the Almeida Garrett Library, was designed and placed in an almost equidistant position between the historical centre and the western zone. Both buildings and their reading atmospheres are quite different. Readers and professionals tend to compare them. And so the question arises: how do two different architectural spaces shape reading practices, even though they are inserted in the same city and serving potentially similar readers? The question sought to explore the interaction between people and space, in other words, how a space provided for reading may be appropriated, how it shapes reading practices, and, what social relations are performed in such reading spaces. Buildings tend to reflect both public reading and local cultural policies, even though the use of the space may alter and circumvent the programmed institutional aims. This analysis of space usage takes into account such policies and actual reading practices, along with their meanings and emotions. Social issues such as class, gender, ethnicity, age and power relationships provided a context for this analysis.

To improve population health, it is important to create environments that support activity, participation and health. One crucial aspect concerns the degree to which the built environment is accessible for all people including those with reduced functional capacity. The overarching objective of this thesis was to explore and further develop methodology for accessibility assessments based on the notion of person-environment fit. Type profiles that represent groups characterized by their combinations of functional limitations were explored as an approach to analyze accessibility problems at the group level. To support societal planning and decision procedures, basic simulated accessibility analyses were conducted as a method to identify different sets of housing improvement priorities that are applicable for groups with different functional capacity. Sixty-one core environmental barriers in terms of accessibility problem detection were identified. This represented a preliminary version of an accessibility screening tool, which can be efficient for research and policy interventions focusing on accessibility. Based on a conceptual analysis, techniques for statistically analyzing the variation of agreement data were explored. This approach can identify the most influential sources of disagreement. Finally, a typology of person-environment fit constellations was constructed, which will thereby facilitate an extension of the methodology for accessibility assessments that are applicable in different environmental arenas. The results of this thesis have implications for further research related to the development of tools and methods that can ultimately support societal efforts in achieving a built environment that is accessible for all citizens, regardless of functional capacity.

The debate frame is mostly concentrating on teaching methods, processes of education, credit systems, competencies, and how those competencies are to be tested. The problem is the cohesiveness of architectural competencies of the graduates into global conditions. In this context, the design studios as the backbone of the architectural education have started to involve in their agenda all kinds of new methods and theories concerning contemporary architecture.

The impact of that culture as a \u201ccontemporary approach\u201d is getting stronger not only on architecture in practice but also the education. Under those circumstances, it was a necessity to manifest our perspective on Architecture, space and identity of the Architect. Briefly, our goal is to initiate awareness in students about the ruling - innate ideas and content behind styles, movements, and forms. It is our utmost concern to motivate them to consider the real but unseen, and sometimes ignored, content and components of architecture in their personal - professional - aesthetic judgments.

Therefore, it is necessary to change the awareness of sustainable living environments, not only on the construction side but also the residents. In recent years, the number of cases of residents' participation in planning, maintaining, and repairing increased. However, sometimes youths and children, who might spend a lifetime longer than adults in a city after the developments have been done, are not included in this Residents. Concerning youth and children's participation, CFC (child friendly city) is one of the good practices for sustainable development. It was launched by UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund) and UN-Habitat in the Habitat II in 1996. City governments, especially in European countries, started to view CFC as their key concept for preservation and/or sustainable development. CFC means not only being Children friendly but also All people friendly. Various effects have been reported since the Historic Cities/districts included CFC in their city planning as a common concept, especially in education, community re-development, and operation and maintenance by the community.

Space dominates all the art activities human do and plays a role of providing aesthetic emotion. Architecture, sculpture, painting, and furniture, etc. these two and three dimensional works are represented in space and interpreted the role of its form, structure and function. Each area is different, but space has been studied in philosophy, physics, geometry, and mathematical studies, etc. and has been consistently interpreted and represented relating to a variety of human creative activity. Furniture is also three dimensional art being dependent on space. In the United States in 2004, I made the living room bench by applying the spatial concept at Rochester Institute of Technology. Two years later, this design was adopted by wendell Castle Collection, an American furniture company, then prototype were made and tested three times during a year, and then since 2007 as indoor benches it has been manufactured in the United States. The study\u2019s purpose is to order the process of its development based on the experience of bench production applied the spatial concept, and by analyzing the properties of spatial concept, I am planning to propose a new concept on interaction with the space and furniture for next.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2202585595"}}

The purpose of this study is to analyze the user`s affinity according to the rest space of the University library. Today, University campuses is community interaction with their learning, and much more is needed. Library of the University campus, students and local residents to use common property belongs to. Other facilities on campus than be a center of communication between users and opportunities for interaction are more facilities. The rest of the campus library space, walking, relaxing, meeting a variety of activities and a place to take full advantage of the relaxing atmosphere of relaxation, increasing the efficiency thus increases will become effective when the learning. To do this, this study highlights the importance the university campus in the library and use the rest space is easy to analyze and to plan a comfortable space to present the evidence is. The purpose of this study in a university campus, the library's rest room, and an analysis was performed as follows to: First, the resting place of the University Library to study and relaxation were classified into the four major types. And the rest of the space elements include floors, walls, ceilings, pillars, air, color, sound and lighting was limited. Second, each university libraries around the campus of the University that examined the practice of relaxation. Third, as a survey among users of the behavior and preferences were identified. Fourth, a survey of the elements of relaxation with a preference for a comfortable and easy to use comprehensive analysis to plan the space to give reasons.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2231741754"}}

While the discipline of industrial design can contribute to developing more environmentally friendly products, researchers have found that even in companies with environmentally progressive products, engineers are more readily involved in ecodesign activities than industrial designers. Some authors propose to fundamentally change the context for designers and free them from their current role of serving the economically motivated manufacturing industry. This would allow them to generate sustainable solutions and actively contribute to sustainable development. Other scholars direct their attention towards the knowledge and ability of industrial designers to conduct ecodesign activities. The role industrial designers can take for ecodesign within their current environment remains unclear.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2234975149"}}

This study aims to make suggestions to improve practically the current space usage on the basis of the results of investigating the spatial size and intended use of each building in the campus premises of Sahmyook university to understand objectively the current status of space usage, Such the current status was investigated using the official schedule of each lecture room, and all buildings were directly visited to compare their actual spatial size and intended use to their drawings, Based upon the results of this investigation, the following conclusions were drawn: A, For some departments (e.g., Chemistry, Food & Nutrition, Business Administration Information, Art Content, Communication Design, etc.) whose primarily used buildings are divided into twos, it is considered necessary to arrange their separate buildings into a single one in future. B. Even if any spaces other than primarily used buildings are to be used, it is required to place them close to primarily used buildings as possible. C. It seems to be required to give careful consideration to the Department of Social Welfare occupying the oldest and smallest building as well as the Departments of Health Management and Animal Biotechnology which have been newly separated without primarily used buildings. D. As professors` laboratories generally tend to be not located mainly in the primarily used buildings, but scattered on campus, it is thought that it is pressing to improve that in the aspect of student management and educational efficiency. E. Finally, it is considered that further studies should address whether administrative spaces other than department offices are centralized, and thus require rearrangement.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2256322418"}}

The teaching and learning of Design for Sustainability (DfS) is not any easy undertaking within today\u2019s well-established discipline of industrial design. As DfS learning emphasises \u2018unlearning\u2019 the product-based approach, it involves the uptake of a set of design skills that, if not contradictory, are entirely novel, such as the co-creation approach, consumption-alleviation thinking and solution-based design, thus posing a challenge for most physically oriented design students. Because of the seemingly alienated nature of DfS, most design schools in China are having difficulty in promoting DfS teaching, or have been forced to put it to one side as a \u2018decorative\u2019 subject within the discipline of industrial design, thus hindering its natural development within design education. In this paper, the authors argue that DfS learning is best begun from the \u2018unlearned\u2019 practices of industrial design, and is best pursued within a local, social setting. Cases supporting this view are also presented to serve as a reference for alternative DfS teaching and learning approaches in and for China.", "lang": "en", "id": "https://openalex.org/W2262531844"}}
